Documentation: runner.py — Orchestrator Pipeline Runner
Objective
The purpose of runner.py is to automate the step-by-step execution of complex test and analysis pipelines using recipes defined in YAML files. It centralizes pipeline orchestration—including state sharing, error handling, dependency management, context logging, and resource tracking—enabling reproducible, robust, and traceable workflow automation.

Description
Pipeline Engine: runner.py reads a YAML recipe file containing a list of ordered steps (scriptlets), executes each step while respecting dependencies, and manages in-memory shared state (ctx) accessible by all steps.

Context Logging: It ensures any modification to shared context (ctx) is optionally logged for traceability. This enables debugging, auditing, and reproducibility.

Error Handling: If a step fails, runner.py logs the error reason, pickles the context and files for diagnostics, and exits gracefully.

Parallelism and Background Execution: Steps can be marked for background (background: true) or parallel (parallel: true) execution, running via multi-threading.

Resource Monitoring: For each step, runner.py reports resource usage (time, memory, CPU, disk usage, process IDs).

Execution Graph: It contains a stub for updating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) visualizing the flow/progress of the recipe execution (for visualization at Assets/graph.png).

State Persistence & Resume: On error, it saves the full context and file state, supporting resume from a specific step after correction.

Flexible Step Selection: Users can run only selected steps, skip steps, or resume from a failed step using CLI flags.

Dependencies & Requirements
Python: 3.8 or newer

Libraries:

pyyaml (YAML parsing)

psutil (resource monitoring)

shutil, traceback, datetime (system and diagnostics tasks)

pickle (state persistence)

Internal:

context.py (Context class for shared, JSON-serializable state)

All scriptlet modules referenced in the recipes

File System:

Reads recipe YAMLs from orchestrator/recipes

Logs stored in orchestrator/Logs/

Assets (e.g., execution graphs) in orchestrator/Assets/

Persisted state in orchestrator/state.pkl

Optional:

Assets/graph.png: generated by the (stub) graph update method; requires Graphviz and suitable extensions if fully implemented.

Applications & Integrations
Automated Test Execution. Pipelines consisting of pre-processing, data cleaning, stats computation, AI analysis, report generation, and dashboards can be described declaratively and repeatedly executed.

Reporting Workflows. Steps may produce intermediate files for Excel, Word, etc., all tracked in context for later steps.

Live Dashboards. Supports background data generation and concurrent dashboard visualization.

Reusable Framework. New scriptlets (Python or shell) can be integrated and immediately leveraged from recipes.

Integrations:

Python “scriptlet” steps: Must include module and function definition, plus params dict.

Shell “scriptlet” steps: Must include cmd and args array; ctx may be exposed as environment variables for shell scriptlets.

Recipes: YAML files with steps (ordered, named lists) and top-level test_meta block (for documentation and reporting).

Usage
Typical usage pattern:

bash
# Run a complete recipe
python runner.py --recipe recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml

# Enable debug mode for verbose logging
python runner.py --debug

# Run only specific steps
python runner.py --only create_screen_with_log start_shared_ctx

# Skip a step by name
python runner.py --skip launch_dash_in_screen

# Resume from a failure (after fixing the issue)
python runner.py --resume-from update_ctx_background
Example Recipe Step Block:
YAML step (Python type):

text
- idx: 4
  name: start_shared_ctx
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_init
  function: run
  params:
    keys: ['mydata']
YAML step (shell type):

text
- idx: 1
  name: create_screen_with_log
  type: shell
  cmd: scriptlets/shell/screen_script.sh
  args:
    - -r
    - test_screen
  stdout_to_ctx: screen_log
Partial Recipe Execution
To troubleshoot or develop only selected steps:

bash
python runner.py --only start_shared_ctx update_ctx_background
Recover from Failure
If a step fails, fix the error, then resume:

bash
python runner.py --resume-from name_of_failed_step
This reloads the saved ctx and optionally any file state for maximum reproducibility.

Limitations
No Support for Non-YAML Recipes: Only .yaml recipes in orchestrator/recipes are accepted.

Requires JSON-Serializable State: No support for non-serializable objects in context—this is strictly enforced.

Digraph Visualization is a Stub: The execution DAG (Assets/graph.png) is not generated by default. Requires further implementation.

Single-Process Python Parallelism: Uses threading; potential GIL limitations for CPU-bound tasks (consider multiprocess for heavy compute).

Error Handling Limited to Step Level: If a step fails, the pipeline halts. No in-flow automatic retries or partial resumption (other than via CLI).

Shell Scriptlet ctx Export: Only supports simple environment variable transfer—not robust for large/complex context data.

No Recipe Syntax Validation: Relies on runtime errors for recipe mistakes such as missing fields, types, or step names.

Detailed Example Workflows
1. Dash App and Data Updater Pipeline (as in demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml)
This example combines shell and python scriptlets, background threads, and dashboard streaming in a single pipeline:

text
test_meta:
  test_id: demo_screen_dash_ctx
  tester: test_user
  description: Demo pipeline with Dash and shared context.

steps:
  - idx: 1
    name: create_screen_with_log
    type: shell
    cmd: scriptlets/shell/screen_script.sh
    args: [-r, test_screen]

  - idx: 2
    name: launch_dash_in_screen
    type: shell
    cmd: scriptlets/shell/screen_script.sh
    args: [-s, test_screen, "python scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py --port 8050 --ctx_key new_row"]
    depends_on: [create_screen_with_log]

  - idx: 3
    name: start_shared_ctx
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_init
    function: run
    params: {keys: ["new_row"]}
    depends_on: [launch_dash_in_screen]

  - idx: 4
    name: update_ctx_background
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_row_updater
    function: run
    params: {key: "new_row", n: 3, interval_sec: 1}
    background: true
    depends_on: [start_shared_ctx]

  - idx: 5
    name: monitor_and_plot
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.apps.hello_dash
    function: run
    params: {port: 8050, ctx_key: "new_row"}
    depends_on: [update_ctx_background]
Execution:

bash
python runner.py --recipe recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml
Logs will be in Logs/, ctx tracked, and the live dashboard available at http://localhost:8050.

Recommendations & Tips for Future Expansion
To further enhance the capabilities of runner.py while remaining compliant with your workspace and documentation standards, consider the following:

1. Implement Full Digraph Generation
Use Graphviz (already a dependency) to generate and auto-update a DAG image (Assets/graph.png) after each step.

Color nodes (green: success, orange: running, red: failed) for visualization/debugging.

2. Add Recipe and Step Schema Validation
Before running, validate the YAML’s schema (names/types/params/dependencies) to catch issues early.

Use pykwalify or write a custom validator for required fields and step types.

3. Extend Error and Exception Handling
Provide more granular, user-friendly error messages.

Support automatic step retry with exponential backoff using fields in the step definition (cf. your ctx_step_retry.py).

4. Add Multiprocessing Support
For heavy, CPU-bound workloads, add support for requires_process: true on steps, switching from threads to processes.

Leverage Python’s multiprocessing where single-thread performance is a bottleneck.

5. Standardize Logging and Audit Trails
Centralize logging via a pluggable logger class (possibly as a scriptlet).

Support log levels, step-level audit, and combine with ctx-based action traces (your ctx_logger.py, ctx_step_audit.py).

6. Recipe/Scriptlet Registry and Auto-Discovery
Add a CLI or API (runner.py --list-steps) listing all available scriptlets and their docstrings for discoverability (following your project standards).

7. Event Hooks and Notifications
Support user-provided hooks (Python/callback or shell) on step success, failure, or pipeline completion.

Allow notification steps (email, Slack, etc.) natively within the recipe.

8. Enhanced Parallel/Background Management
Add support for dependency groups, resource constraints, or batching for parallel execution.

Optionally integrate process pools for even more scalable parallelism.

9. Step Extension/Override Decorators
Allow steps to be wrapped by decorators (for logging, resource monitoring, error handling) either globally or per-step/configured by recipe.

10. Recipe Versioning and Change Tracking
Save a hash or version number with each recipe and (optionally) checkpoint of ctx for robust pipeline re-running and diffing.

11. Resume, Rollback, and Checkpointing
Add commands for mid-run checkpoint/rollback, using your ctx_checkpoint.py/ctx_step_rollback_point.py scriptlets.

12. Step Package Isolation/Sandboxing
For safety and modularity, consider running scriptlets in isolated environments (virtualenvs or containers) if security or reproducibility is a concern.

13. Enhanced CLI with Wizard/Prompt Support
Allow interactive wizard-style creation of recipes, and on-the-fly editing/validation.

14. Enhanced Documentation and Linting
Extend both runner.py and all scriptlets to check for/emit detailed usage guidance, options, and limitations.

Best Practices

Keep all scriptlets as atomic as possible: one step, one responsibility.

Always use JSON-serializable values in ctx.

Resist the temptation to over-generalize scriptlet logic—composition is the foundation of flexibility and testability in this framework.

Use debug mode (--debug or runner.debug file) for stepwise context inspection/logging during development.

Summary:
runner.py is the central orchestrator glue for robust, traceable, and reusable pipeline automation in your workspace. By evolving as suggested above—and tightly integrating with your rich library of scriptlets and standardized context handling—it will remain both maximally extensible and reliable for all kinds of workflow automation and analytics projects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
context.py – Technical Documentation
Objective
The context.py module is designed to provide a robust in-memory, JSON-serializable context for orchestrator pipelines. Its goals are:

Enable data sharing and state persistence across all steps in orchestrator workflows.

Enforce safe storage (JSON-serializable types only) to maximize interoperability and avoid runtime serialization errors.

Record timestamped modification history for each key for auditing and debugging (extendable).

Allow easy export of context keys as environment variables for use in shell scriptlets.

Offer a simple, extensible interface for orchestrator core, Python scriptlets, shell wrappers, dashboards, and reporting.

Description
Core Class: Context
Subclass of dict: Enables familiar dictionary semantics for storage of any number of key/value pairs.

Enhanced setitem: When you set a key, it:

Validates serializability via json.dumps(value). Raises a ValueError if the object cannot be serialized.

Automatically logs a timestamped “history” of changes to each key (value, timestamp, and who made the change—default "step_name").

History and Utility APIs:

get_history(key): Returns all history entries for a key.

last_modified(key): Timestamp of last modification, or None.

update(...): Safely update with multiple key/value pairs, also tracked in history.

Utility Function: expose_for_shell
Converts specified ctx keys into (stringified or JSON-stringified) environment variables to facilitate context-to-shell handoff.

Keys with dict/list values are serialized as JSON for correct shell/CLI consumption.

All others are converted to string.

Design Choices
No built-in persistence (but orchestrator runner.py can pickle/restore ctx via workflow control).

No built-in versioning/rollback beyond the modification history per key, but easily extensible.

JSON-serializability is strictly enforced, guaranteeing that ctx remains portable, interpretable, and savable.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+

Standard Library:

json

time

typing (for type hints)

Applications, Integration, and Usage
Applications and Integration
Runner Orchestration: Core orchestration (runner.py) relies on Context for:

Persistent inter-step data (metrics, status, logs, IDs).

Safe resume after a failed pipeline (via pickled states).

Robust debug and resource audit logging.

Scriptlets (Python): All step implementations (scriptlets/python/steps/…) read/write ctx for inputs, outputs, and intermediates.

Scriptlets (Shell): Via expose_for_shell, Python exports selected ctx keys to shell environment, enabling shell scripts to participate in the pipeline.

Dash and Reporting Apps: Dash dashboards and reporting utilities visualize, plot, and summarize data from ctx.

Unit Testing: Used in test cases (e.g., tests/test_ctx.py) to ensure compliance.

Usage Examples
1. Basic Context Creation and Use
python
from context import Context

ctx = Context()
ctx["foo"] = 123                     # Sets key, tracked in history
ctx["bar"] = {"a": [1, 2, 3]}
print(ctx)                            # {'foo': 123, 'bar': {'a': [1, 2, 3]}}
2. Accessing Key History
python
mod_history = ctx.get_history("foo")
# [{'timestamp': 1692134341.1287, 'value': 123, 'who': 'step_name'}]

last = ctx.last_modified("foo")
# Returns UNIX timestamp of last change
3. Serializability Enforcement
python
ctx["baz"] = open("file.txt")         # Raises ValueError!
Safe-by-design: Only serializable types (str, int, float, list, dict, etc.) are allowed.

4. Update Multiple Keys
python
ctx.update({"x": 10, "y": 20, "foo": 999})
print(ctx["foo"])                    # 999
Each set is tracked in its own “who/when/value” history entry.

5. Export for Shell Script
python
from context import expose_for_shell

ctx["LIST"] = [1, 2, 3]
env = expose_for_shell(ctx, ["foo", "LIST"])
# env = {'foo': '999', 'LIST': '[1, 2, 3]'}
Can pass env directly to subprocess.Popen(env=env,...) or shell.

6. Integration with runner.py
Example of runner setting, updating, and persisting ctx during orchestration:

python
from context import Context

ctx = Context()
# ... steps executed, data added ...
runner.save_state(ctx, files_touched)
# Later, after a resume:
ctx.update(loader.load_state()["ctx"])
Limitations
Only supports JSON-serializable objects; any attempt to store unserializable objects raises an immediate error.

In-memory only unless pickling or explicit saving by runner or scriptlet.

No automatic versioning or rollback: only timestamped change logs per-key; true version control, rollback, or checkpoint/revert must be layered on top (see suggestions).

No access control or concurrency/atomicity (single thread/process assumed, no locking built-in).

No on-disk sync unless hooked into orchestrator or specialized scriptlets.

Basic “who” field always sets "step_name" (can be extended to set real actor/step names from runner).

Not suitable for extremely large binary objects.

Best Practices, Tips, and Recommendations
Best Practices and Guidance
Always validate objects before storing in ctx (testing for serializability or type).

Use descriptive, unambiguous keys; group related data with clear naming (e.g., metrics_summary, ai_result, test_meta).

Use history methods to trace, audit, and debug pipelines (“who changed what, when”).

Use expose_for_shell to pass only the needed keys, not the entire context.

Avoid storing large datasets unless necessary; instead, store paths or summaries.

Recommendations and Forward-Looking Enhancements
To further strengthen, modernize, and future-proof context.py (within the guidelines/criteria in your framework), consider the following upgrades and additions:

1. Enhanced Versioning and Checkpointing
Allow optional history per-key including old/new diff, not just latest value.

Provide full-context snapshot/restore APIs (possibly integrated with incremental save-to-disk).

Allow runner to set actual who based on step/plugin name for better audit trails.

2. Persistence, Autosave, and Crash-Safe State
Implement a file-based auto-save option (JSON or pickle) with atomic writes.

Add ability to periodically flush ctx to a backup file for crash-resilience.

Add a method to export full ctx to new locations (e.g., remote server, S3, DB).

3. Concurrency and Multi-Process Safety
Provide optional synchronization/locking API (e.g., file locks/context managers) for workflows using multiprocessing or parallel orchestrator runners.

Integrate with Unix file locking to prevent race conditions if desired.

4. Fine-Grained Auditing and Metrics
Enhance .get_history(key) to support filtered and summarized audits (e.g., by time, step, or type of change).

Allow registering hooks or triggers that log every ctx mutation to persistent log, or push to dashboards in real-time.

5. Plug-in and Extension Hooks
Add a plugin or event-hook system so advanced users can validate, filter, or modify ctx changes (value validators, preprocessors, etc.).

Support pre/post-set hooks for sensitive keys (for validation, normalization, background computation, etc.).

6. Explicit Type Validation
Allow specifying and enforcing expected types/shapes for certain keys.

Produce a summary of the full schema for easy validation and auto-documentation.

7. Utility Enhancements
Support diffing between two ctx snapshots, for reporting or audit use.

Utilities to merge, branch, or layer multiple ctx objects (e.g., for scenarios, simulations, or A/B tests).

8. Interactivity and Visualization
Add optional integration with Dash or other live GUIs for viewing live ctx snapshots, diffs, or change logs.

Provide a to_html()/to_md() method to directly output pretty-formatted views for reporting.

9. Context Naming/Scoping
Support for namespaces or hierarchical key naming for large or multi-tenant orchestrators.

Conclusion
The context.py module is thoughtfully constructed for safe, auditable, flexible in-memory state management for complex automations. It is both simple for end-users and extensible for advanced orchestration, reporting, and automation scenarios.

By following the recommendation and enhancement sections above, you can further future-proof your orchestrator workspace—adding improved reliability, traceability, recoverability, performance, and extensibility, while always honoring the workspace’s composability, auditability, and code-quality philosophy.

---------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for scriptlets/shell/screen_script.sh
Objective
screen_script.sh is a shell scriptlet designed to manage and automate operations on GNU screen sessions. It provides the orchestrator framework with the ability to programmatically create, list, destroy, send commands to, and log output from named screen sessions. This is essential for:

Running persistent long-lived background processes (such as Dash apps).

Decoupling step execution so that interactive and monitoring applications can run outside the main orchestrator process.

Enabling robust, script-controlled session management for test and dashboard pipelines.

Description
Written in Bash and intended to be called both directly from the shell and as a scriptlet step in orchestrator YAML recipes.

Offers a CLI with subcommands to list, kill, create, destroy-and-recreate, send commands to, and run GNU screen sessions with logging enabled.

Ensures that session management is based on user-friendly names (not PIDs), fitting recipe-based orchestration and audit requirements.

The key functionality includes:

Listing sessions: Outputs a two-column (PID, Name) table of running screen sessions.

Creating sessions: Launches new named screen sessions in detached mode.

Killing sessions: Cleanly terminates named screens.

Destroy/recreate: Ensures a session is reset by killing and recreating it.

Sending commands: Sends a string (including a simulated Enter key) to a running session, enabling launch of long-running apps in a detached TTY environment (important for GUI-less servers).

Running with logging: Launches a session designed for logging, saving output to a Logs subdirectory with timestamping and frequent flushes.

All actions are performed using built-in features of GNU screen, making the script cross-compatible with typical Unix/Linux setups. Usage is safe and side-effect-free (does not affect other orchestrator files or processes).

Dependencies
Required
GNU screen (must be installed and in the system's PATH)

Command-line tool for session multiplexing.

Verified at script runtime.

Bash shell (tested with bash; POSIX shell compatibility not guaranteed).

awk, sed, find (standard Unix tools, used for argument parsing and output formatting).

Write permissions for Logs/ directory to store session logs.

Optional/Integration
No required dependencies on Python or orchestrator code—this scriptlet is purely a shell utility and interacts with orchestrator via CLI and log files.

Applications and Integrations
Orchestrator Pipeline Steps:
Used in YAML recipes as a shell-type step to configure automation pipelines, particularly those involving persistent background apps (e.g., launching Dash or Jupyter).

Stand-alone Management:
Can be used by operators for manual debugging, session investigation, or emergency recovery without invoking the full orchestrator.

Live Monitoring:
Combined with logging, allows orchestrator to initiate and monitor web servers, simulations, or data streams externally and asynchronously.

Automation with State Audit:
Enables traceable audit trails, as all session logs are saved in a predictable location (e.g., Logs/test_screen_screen.log), which can then be referenced in reports.

Example integration within an orchestrator recipe:

text
steps:
  - idx: 1
    name: create_screen_for_dash
    type: shell
    cmd: scriptlets/shell/screen_script.sh
    args:
      - -r
      - dash_screen
    stdout_to_ctx: screen_create_log

  - idx: 2
    name: run_dash_app
    type: shell
    cmd: scriptlets/shell/screen_script.sh
    args:
      - -s
      - dash_screen
      - "python3 scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py --port 8050"
Limitations
Requires GNU screen; will fail gracefully with a clear message if not found.

Session management is by name only—not PID. Cannot interact with sessions started outside the script if name unknown.

Log flushing via screen built-in features; may not capture output at millisecond granularity.

No window or tab multiplexing beyond basic session.

No deep orchestration: For more complex automation (multiple concurrent apps per session, nested screens, etc.), further scripting is required.

No built-in error handling for sending commands to dead sessions (fails with an error message).

Unix-like systems only (Linux, MacOS, BSD). Not compatible with native Windows.

Usage and CLI Examples
Here is a complete breakdown with code and explanation for each mode:

List Sessions
Command:

text
./screen_script.sh -l
Output Format:

text
12345      test_screen
67890      another_screen
Kill (Terminate) a Session
Command:

text
./screen_script.sh -k test_screen
If the session does not exist, prints a warning and exits gracefully.

Create a Detached Session
Command:

text
./screen_script.sh -c my_analysis
Starts my_analysis as a detached (background) session.

Destroy and Recreate a Session
Command:

text
./screen_script.sh -d my_analysis
Guaranteed that the named session is running fresh.

Send a Command to a Running Session
Command:

text
./screen_script.sh -s dash_screen "python3 my_dashboard.py --port 8050"
Launches a long-running web app inside an existing screen session.

Command string will be passed and executed with a simulated enter key.

Run with Logging (Capture All Output)
Command:

text
./screen_script.sh -r mysession
Starts a detached session, enables logging to Logs/mysession_screen.log, and flushes output every second.

Useful for live diagnostics, crash debugging, and pipeline output auditing.

Usage Help
Command:

text
./screen_script.sh
or with any invalid arguments.

Shows the help text detailing all supported options.

Advanced Workflow Example (Multi-step)
text
# Create a screen with logging for "reports"
./screen_script.sh -r reports
# Start a Python service in the screen
./screen_script.sh -s reports "python3 orchestrator/scriptlets/python/apps/sample_dash.py"
# List all running screens
./screen_script.sh -l
# Send a 'stop' or diagnostic command
./screen_script.sh -s reports "killall python3"
# Kill the session after finishing
./screen_script.sh -k reports
Recommendations and Expansion Tips
1. Return JSON-parseable Results (for orchestrator ctx integration)
Pipe session state to a JSON string or structured table that other scriptlets can consume and log directly.

2. Enhanced Error Codes & Exit Status
Map exit codes for each operation (e.g., 0 = OK, 1 = Not found, 100 = Dependency missing).

Pass failures up to orchestrator for robust handling.

3. Support for More Advanced Logging
Allow specifying custom log file locations, log rotation, or remote log piping.

Add an option for teeing live output to orchestrator ctx/log (e.g., using named pipes or tail -F).

4. Attach and Interactive Mode
Add an -a session_name command to allow orchestrator to re-attach and tail session interactively.

5. Environment Variable Integration
Support passing ctx keys (from orchestrator) as environmental variables into created sessions, leveraging expose_for_shell.

6. Fine-grained Command Execution
Support running multiple commands from a file or list in one operation, with control over command timing, delays, or chaining.

7. Session Health Checks
Add options to verify whether a command is running in a screen session, PID liveness checks, and automatic restart on failure (i.e., supervisor daemon pattern).

8. Cross-Platform Support
Explore wrappers or compatibility layers for running on Windows via WSL or Cygwin (document as advanced or unsupported).

9. Recipe Discovered Sessions
Add a feature to scan recipe YAML for required session names and pre-check their existence/status.

10. Integration with Log Clean-up Utilities
Standardize output and locations so that orchestration utilities like clean_pristine.sh can clean up logs, or even prune old screen sessions automatically.

11. Documentation and Usage Meta
Auto-generate help based on function block comments, extract usage to markdown, or update orchestrator UserGuide YAML automatically from the script.

Best Practices
Always provide robust, unique names for screen sessions.

Chain -s (send command) only after -c or -r to avoid lost commands.

For long-running jobs (e.g., dashboards), always use logging mode for traceability.

Clean up sessions and logs routinely for stable automation environments.

For orchestrator integration, always capture STDOUT/STDERR to ctx for full reporting and troubleshooting.

-------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for scriptlets/shell/ctx_env_echo.py
1. Objective
The ctx_env_echo.py scriptlet’s main goal is to demonstrate and debug the integration between the orchestrator’s in-memory shared context (ctx) and shell scripts by printing out all context keys passed as environment variables. This is especially useful for validating and inspecting the data bridge when orchestrator steps need to hand off structured data from Python to shell scripts.

2. Description
Purpose:
Prints out all environment variables whose names start with CTX_, each on its own line. This script makes it easy to verify what context data has been exported from the orchestrator to a shell step—as per your framework’s design, which uses expose_for_shell to map selected ctx keys to shell environment variables.

How it works:
Iterates over all environment variables, selects those that are CTX_*, and prints both the variable's name and value. Handles quoted values transparently.

General Use Case:
Use this scriptlet as a debugging or demo step to see what key–value pairs from ctx are being exposed to the shell during an orchestrator pipeline run.

3. Dependencies
Shell/Bash Interpreter:
This script requires /usr/bin/env bash (Bash shell) for execution.

Standard Unix Environment:
Relies on standard Unix utilities (env, grep, while, read, and echo)—no external or non-portable dependencies.

4. Application, Integration, and Usage
a) Orchestrator Recipe Integration
This scriptlet is intended to be run as a shell step in a YAML recipe. For example:

text
- name: show_ctx_env_vars
  type: shell
  cmd: scriptlets/shell/ctx_env_echo.py
  # Optionally provide shell_env_keys: ["foo", "bar"]
When the orchestrator executes this step, it will expose the specified keys in ctx as CTX_foo, CTX_bar, etc., in the environment.

b) Standalone CLI Usage
To use directly in a shell where CTX_* environment variables exist:

text
export CTX_foo="bar"
export CTX_myjson='{"x":1}'
bash scriptlets/shell/ctx_env_echo.py
Output:

text
CTX ENV VARS:
CTX_foo=bar
CTX_myjson={"x":1}
c) Example: Orchestrator Python → Shell Integration
Suppose your orchestrator has set:

python
env = expose_for_shell(ctx, ["result", "metrics"])
# Exports CTX_result and CTX_metrics to the shell
In your recipe:

text
- name: echo_ctx
  type: shell
  cmd: scriptlets/shell/ctx_env_echo.py
  shell_env_keys: ["result", "metrics"]
When this shell scriptlet runs, you’ll see:

text
CTX ENV VARS:
CTX_result=[12, 14, 16]
CTX_metrics={"mean":7.2,"std":0.91}
d) With YAML Example Including Downstream Steps
text
- idx: 1
  name: preprocess
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.my_data_scriptlet
  function: run
  params:
    key: processed
- idx: 2
  name: export_ctx
  type: shell
  cmd: scriptlets/shell/ctx_env_echo.py
  shell_env_keys: ["processed"]
  depends_on: [preprocess]
This will print all ctx keys exported as env vars for the export_ctx step.

5. Limitations
Read-only:
Only prints environment variables—does not alter context or modify data.

Env-based only:
Assumes ctx keys are exported as environment variables prefixed by CTX_. Will not read files or parse other forms of context handoff.

No error handling:
If run with no CTX_ variables, simply prints an empty set; no warnings or errors.

JSON Content Not Decoded:
If you encode lists/dicts as JSON, the script will print the raw string (you’ll see e.g., CTX_metrics={"mean":7.2}), not pretty-printed or validated JSON.

Not Windows Compatible:
Bash-specific, may require adaptation to run under native Windows shells.

6. Detailed Usage Examples
Example 1: Just print all ctx environment variables

text
export CTX_foo=hello
export CTX_bar='{"val":1}'
bash scriptlets/shell/ctx_env_echo.py
# Output:
# CTX ENV VARS:
# CTX_foo=hello
# CTX_bar={"val":1}
Example 2: Use in orchestrator recipe with stdout capture

text
- name: echo_env
  type: shell
  cmd: scriptlets/shell/ctx_env_echo.py
  shell_env_keys: ["result"]
  stdout_to_ctx: echo_env_output
After this step, ctx["echo_env_output"] will contain a printable listing of all CTX_* env vars.

Example 3: No env variables

text
env -i bash scriptlets/shell/ctx_env_echo.py
# Output:
# CTX ENV VARS:
# (no further output)
Example 4: Combined with Python serialization

python
ctx = {}
ctx["foo"] = {"a":[1,2],"b":"bar"}
env = expose_for_shell(ctx, ["foo"])
# env: CTX_foo='{"a":[1,2],"b":"bar"}'
Then in shell:

text
# CTX ENV VARS:
# CTX_foo={"a":[1,2],"b":"bar"}
7. Recommendations for Enhancement and Expansion
General Tips
Always use this script after critical ctx→shell boundary crossings to validate exported data.

Consider piping environment variable output to other tools/scripts for further validation or dynamic processing.

Possible Feature Expansions
Pretty-print JSON values:
Attempt to parse and pretty-print any detected JSON values, making inspection easier.

Selective Key Filtering:
Add an argument to only print certain keys, or to exclude specific patterns (e.g., only CTX_foo, exclude CTX_DEBUG).

Validate JSON Syntax:
Parse each value; if valid JSON, output confirmation or error.

Export to File:
Add an option to export all values to a file for archiving.

Support Multi-line Values:
Handle and display multiline (e.g., base64, certificates) with better formatting.

Raise Warnings or Errors:
Add option to raise a warning if required keys are missing.

Cross-Platform Support:
Adapt for POSIX sh or Python so it can run in environments without bash.

Framework Compliance & Enhancement
All new features should:

Keep the scriptlet atomic—do one job well, but optionally chainable.

Document every option or feature in a top-of-script docstring.

Maintain strict read-only/default-no-side-effect behavior unless specifically enabled.

Keep all output JSON-safe if needed by downstream steps.

Continue using CTX_ prefix standard from the orchestrator and its expose_for_shell utility.

Write matching Python tests for any expansion features.

Ensure CLI-compatibility: always runnable both from orchestrator and command-line.

8. Summary
The ctx_env_echo.py shell scriptlet acts as a debug, demo, and validation bridge between orchestrator’s Python-based context and shell step execution, correctly following workspace conventions for traceability and modularity. It is easy to expand for advanced introspection, but should retain its atomic design for integration in robust automation workflows

------------------------------------------------------------------
tests/test_hello_dash.py: Comprehensive Documentation
Objective
Primary Purpose:
To verify that the Dash app scriptlet, hello_dash.py, correctly responds to the command-line --help flag, which is a universal convention for providing CLI assistance and documentation.

Quality Assurance:
Ensures that hello_dash.py is independently runnable as a CLI and follows best-practices for developer and user discoverability and usability.

Description
The test is a simple CLI invocation test using Python's subprocess module.

It runs:

text
python scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py --help
It captures the output and asserts that the word 'usage' appears in the output, indicating that the script emits help/usage information when requested.

This test acts as a smoke test for CLI help compliance and a basic health check for deployment/distribution.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library:

subprocess

Test Runner:

Intended for pytest (but does not use pytest features directly—the assertion suffices for most runners).

System/External:

The test expects a valid Python interpreter and that the relative path to hello_dash.py is correct.

No need for a running orchestrator or orchestration context, as it only launches the CLI with --help.

Workspace files:

scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py (relies on its presence and correct import path).

Applications, Integration, and Usage
When to Use:

During CI pipelines to ensure that scriptlet CLI interfaces are not broken.

When making changes to hello_dash.py or to CLI argument parsing infrastructure.

As a baseline for verifying all scriptlets in scriptlets/python/apps/ or scriptlets/python/steps/ comply with minimal CLI requirements.

Direct Usage:

Run via pytest or direct CLI call:

text
pytest tests/test_hello_dash.py
Output:

Pass if "usage" is anywhere in the output.

Fail if help is missing or CLI is broken.

Manual Check (Equivalent):

text
python scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py --help
Output should contain:

text
usage: hello_dash.py ...
  --port PORT
  --ctx_key KEY
  ...
Limitations
Coverage:

Only validates CLI help response, not the full functional behavior of the Dash app, its callbacks, or actual data visualization.

Does not check for argparse errors, misconfiguration, or missing requirements.

Will not cover:

Actual Dash server startup or web UI.

correctness of Dash app interactivity, data handling, or plotting.

False Positives:

If the word "usage" appears in an exception, could pass even if the actual help text isn't emitted. (Best-practice is to be more specific or match multi-line output.)

Platform:

Assumes successful subprocess execution on the target OS.

Example Usages
Testing with Pytest (Most common):

text
pytest tests/test_hello_dash.py
Output:

text
================= test session starts =================
collected 1 item

tests/test_hello_dash.py .                       [100%]

================== 1 passed in 0.2s ===================
Interactive debugging/manual:

python
import subprocess

result = subprocess.run(
    ["python", "scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py", "--help"],
    capture_output=True, text=True
)
print(result.stdout)
assert "usage" in result.stdout.lower()
Use this approach in a notebook or REPL to iteratively test CLI features.

Automated Check for Multiple Scriptlets:

python
# Suppose you are writing a meta-test to check all Python scriptlets for CLI help:
import glob, subprocess

for path in glob.glob("scriptlets/python/apps/*.py"):
    out = subprocess.run(["python", path, "--help"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    assert "usage" in out.stdout.lower(), f"{path} missing CLI usage"
Integration with Workspace and Framework
Fully aligns with your criteria:

Independent Run:

Can be run outside orchestrator/runner, directly as a CLI.

Traceability:

Encourages scriptlet maintainers to provide discoverable documentation, promoting easier onboarding and troubleshooting.

Composable Testing:

Serves as a canonical model for how to test all scriptlets, both Python and shell.

Documentation Standard:

Enforces that every scriptlet must provide proper help/usage information per documentation standards.

Bridge to Orchestrator QA
Serves as a minimum contract for all scriptlet entry-points.

Ensures robust "entrypoint hygiene" before more complex pipeline, GUI, or integration tests are performed.

Recommendations & Suggestions for Enhancement
1. Expand Coverage
Test Functional Launch:
Write an additional test that launches the Dash app using a temporary port, then probes the / path to ensure the server starts (optionally using requests and a timeout).

python
import subprocess, time, requests

def test_dash_launch_and_serve():
    proc = subprocess.Popen(
        ["python", "scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py", "--port", "8051", "--ctx_key", "new_row"],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True
    )
    # Wait for app to start
    time.sleep(3)
    try:
        r = requests.get("http://localhost:8051/")
        assert r.status_code == 200
        assert "Shared ctx Dash Monitor" in r.text
    finally:
        proc.terminate()
2. Parametric Testing
Test with Invalid Flags/No Arguments:
Check that --help always works and that missing required args results in proper errors/help:

python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("args", [
    ["--help"],
    [],    # No arguments
    ["--port", "invalid"],  # Bad argument
])
def test_hello_dash_cli_args(args):
    out = subprocess.run(
        ["python", "scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py", *args],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    assert "usage" in out.stdout.lower()
3. Enforce Help for All Scriptlets
Meta-Test:
Write a test that checks every script in scriptlets/python/apps/ and scriptlets/python/steps/ responds to --help.

4. Lint for Docstring Coverage
Ensure every scriptlet/module provides a clear, comprehensive docstring per workspace rules.

5. Validate CLI Argument Parser
Test that argparse fails gracefully when invalid values or missing required flags are provided.

6. Integration with Coverage Tools
Incorporate tools such as pytest-cov to measure test coverage of scriptlet CLI and functional paths.

7. Document and Version CLI/API
Suggest each scriptlet emits a --version or --about flag summarizing core info (author, last update, etc.).

8. Expand to Web/UI Testing (for Dash)
Use tools like selenium, dash.testing, or pytest-dash for end-to-end UI/graphical testing.

9. Standardize Error Output
Add checks to test outputs when required args are missing or unknown flags are used, enforcing error clarity.

10. Template for Scriptlet Test Files
Provide a test_template_scriptlet.py for maintainers to speed new scriptlet test including both CLI and API-level tests.

Conclusion & Best Practices
This test is a minimal but essential contract-checker for scriptlet CLI hygiene.

To fully leverage your framework’s modularity, maintain this pattern for all scriptlets.

Add more tests to check deeper functional, error-handling, and integration cases.

Use parametric testing to increase coverage without redundancy.

Encourage maintainers to edit the help output for clarity and completeness, as it directly benefits both end users and automated QA.

tests/test_ctx.py — Detailed Documentation & Enhancement Guide
Objective
The primary objective of tests/test_ctx.py is to rigorously test the core features of the Context class, which is fundamental to in-memory data sharing in the orchestrator framework. It verifies that:

ctx supports correct setting and retrieval of values

ctx only allows JSON-serializable objects (raising errors on non-serializable inputs)

all dictionary operations and storage mechanisms work as expected

Thus, this file acts as a safeguard for the reliability and compliance of the orchestrator’s context management.

Description
tests/test_ctx.py is a unit test module that employs pytest to ensure the integrity and correct behavior of the Context class defined in orchestrator/context.py. This class is the backbone of shared state across orchestrator steps, enabling seamless and safe data exchanges between Python and shell scriptlets.

Key Points:
Ensures .setitem__ (get, set) works and only stores serializable objects

Guards that the orchestrator’s most critical shared-memory datastore cannot silently break, become inconsistent, or pollute state with unmanageable types

The test file typically consists of these tests:
Set and Get Test:
Verifies that a value can be set and retrieved:

python
ctx["foo"] = 123
assert ctx["foo"] == 123
JSON-Serializable Test:
Confirms that complex but serializable objects (dict/list) are accepted:

python
ctx["bar"] = {"a": [1, 2, 3]}
assert ctx["bar"]["a"] == [1, 2, 3]
Non-Serializable Test:
Ensures non-serializable objects are explicitly rejected and raise errors:

python
class NotSerializable: pass
with pytest.raises(ValueError):
    ctx["bad"] = NotSerializable()
Dependencies
pytest (for running the test)

Context class from orchestrator/context.py

Internally uses Python standard libraries: json, time, typing

Python >= 3.6

Application & Integration
Application
This test module is used to validate changes to context.py.

Should be executed automatically in CI/CD when updates are made to context code.

Runs as a standalone test:

text
pytest tests/test_ctx.py
Integration
Ensures all Python and shell scriptlets relying on ctx are built upon a robust and reliable shared state.

When integrated with the orchestrator, prevents pipeline/recipe failures rooted in state corruption.

Supports team confidence when enhancing context.py (or introducing new storage/traceability features).

Limitations
Only tests the set, get, and JSON-serializability of the Context class.

Does not cover:

History tracking (get_history, last_modified)

Exposure to shell via expose_for_shell

Thread safety or concurrent modifications

Persistence (saving/loading to disk)

Performance edge-cases or handling of very large objects

Limited to positive and negative cases for serialization—not comprehensive “fuzz” or property-based testing.

Usage Examples
Standalone Execution
Run all tests:

text
pytest tests/test_ctx.py
Sample Output:

text
============================= test session starts ==============================
collecting ... collected 3 items

tests/test_ctx.py::test_ctx_set_get PASSED                              [ 33%]

============================== 3 passed in 0.03s ===============================
Example: Adding a Test
If you want to ensure tuples can also be handled if needed:

python
def test_ctx_accepts_tuple():
    ctx = Context()
    ctx["tup"] = (1, 2, 3)
    assert list(ctx["tup"]) == [1, 2, 3]
Example: Checking History (Expansion)
python
def test_history_tracking():
    ctx = Context()
    ctx["foo"] = 1
    ctx["foo"] = 2
    hist = ctx.get_history("foo")
    assert hist[0]["value"] == 1
    assert hist[1]["value"] == 2
Example: Validating Integration
Test that expose_for_shell produces environment-safe values:

python
from context import expose_for_shell
def test_expose_for_shell():
    ctx = Context()
    ctx["bar"] = ["a", "b", "c"]
    env = expose_for_shell(ctx, ["bar"])
    assert '"a", "b", "c"' in env["bar"]
Recommendations for Enhancement
1. Expand Test Coverage
Add tests for:

.get_history() and .last_modified()

Lossless round-trip serialization with JSON

Edge cases: deeply nested, large objects, strings with special characters, empty values

Thread safety (simulate concurrent ctx writes)

2. Dynamic Value Checking
Employ parameterized tests for serializability over many types:

python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("v,should_pass", [
    (123, True),
    ([1,2,3], True),
    ({"a":1}, True),
    (object(), False),
    (lambda x: x, False),
])
def test_various_serializability(v, should_pass):
    ctx = Context()
    if should_pass:
        ctx["a"] = v
    else:
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            ctx["a"] = v
3. Code Style/Linting Checks
Add linter hooks/test for context.py to encourage style compliance.

4. Integration/Regression Tests
Simulate orchestrator step execution and verify ctx persists as expected through step pipelines.

5. Test Failures & Persistence
Test behavior when serializing/unserializing to disk (fault injection, corrupted files).

6. Test Environment Variable Exposure
Assert correct behavior when exporting ctx to the shell:

python
import os
def test_env_export():
    ctx = Context()
    ctx["key"] = {"foo": "bar"}
    env = expose_for_shell(ctx, ["key"])
    assert isinstance(env["key"], str)
    # Further checks can parse the JSON to ensure validity
7. Document with Docstrings and Comments
Include at least brief docstrings for each test function, explaining what they're validating and why.

8. Compliance and Discoverability
Use the orchestrator’s test registry to auto-discover and report available tests and their purposes.

Add integration with reporting so passing/failing tests are included in generated audit reports.

9. Performance/Stress Testing
Add optional stress test for high-volume ctx usage (can be skipped unless environment variable is set, e.g. SKIP_STRESS_TESTS=1).

Conclusion
The tests/test_ctx.py file is a key piece of defense for the orchestrator automation platform, ensuring the fundamental ctx object is robust, safe, and predictable. By expanding its coverage as recommended above, you greatly improve framework reliability, maintainability, and developer confidence for both small and large-scale automation.

For maximum value:

Ensure each time context.py is altered, this test is run (CI-precommit hook)

Keep tests minimal and atomic, covering each new feature as the context grows (e.g., history, rollback, serialization)

Document every test with intent, not just mechanics

------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for tests/test_ctx_row_updater.py
Objective
To ensure the correct behavior of the ctx_row_updater Python scriptlet, which continuously appends rows of random numeric data with timestamps to a shared in-memory context key in a background thread.

Description
tests/test_ctx_row_updater.py is a unit test designed to validate the functionality of the ctx_row_updater component (scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_row_updater.py). The script verifies that, when invoked, the ctx_row_updater launches a background thread that appends timestamped rows to a given key in the ctx dictionary at a specified interval and with a specified number of random values per row.

This ensures:

The background thread is started correctly and operates as intended.

New data is generated and appended to the target context key.

The scriptlet remains JSON-serializable, in alignment with workspace serialization policies.

Dependencies
Python version: Requires Python 3.6+.

Testing framework: pytest is used for test discovery and execution.

Scriptlet under test: scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_row_updater.py

python
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_row_updater
import time
Applications & Integration
Automated Testing: Integrated directly into the workspace’s tests/ directory, enabling automated checks with standard pytest calls.

Framework CI/CD: Can be included in continuous integration pipelines to verify that core scriptlet functionality remains robust after changes.

Development Workflow: Useful for debugging enhancements or regressions related to background data generation and in-memory context updates.

Integration with Orchestrator Pipeline
The same scriptlet and approach tested here is used in orchestration recipes:

text
- name: update_ctx_background
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_row_updater
  function: run
  params:
    key: "new_row"
    n: 3
    interval_sec: 1
This test ensures such steps will behave as expected when executed in real orchestrator pipelines.

Limitations
Not a CLI Test: The test is API-based and does not verify command-line interface (CLI) invocation or argument parsing.

Timing Sensitivity: The test uses time.sleep to wait for the background thread to append rows. Tests may occasionally flake if the system is heavily loaded or interrupted.

No Cleanup: The background thread is not explicitly stopped after the test; it is left as a daemon, which may consume resources in longer test runs.

Single-thread Behavior: The test only verifies that at least a minimum number of rows has been added, not that the thread continues indefinitely or that all edge cases are covered.

Usage Examples
Typical usage is as follows:

Minimal Example (from the test file):
python
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_row_updater
import time

def test_ctx_row_updater_run():
    ctx = {"foo": []}
    updater = ctx_row_updater.run(ctx, {"key": "foo", "n": 2, "interval_sec": 0.1})
    time.sleep(0.3)
    assert len(ctx["foo"]) >= 2
Initializes an empty list in ctx["foo"].

Starts a background updater thread adding rows with 2 random values every 0.1 seconds.

Waits 0.3 seconds.

Asserts at least 2 rows have been added.

Expanding/Adjusting Examples:
Example: Test a Different Key and Number of Columns

python
def test_multiple_columns():
    ctx = {"bar": []}
    ctx_row_updater.run(ctx, {"key": "bar", "n": 5, "interval_sec": 0.05})
    time.sleep(0.25)
    assert len(ctx["bar"]) >= 3
    assert len(ctx["bar"][0]) == 6  # 1 timestamp + 5 random columns
Example: Test with a Longer Interval

python
def test_slow_update():
    ctx = {"baz": []}
    ctx_row_updater.run(ctx, {"key": "baz", "n": 1, "interval_sec": 0.15})
    time.sleep(0.35)
    count = len(ctx["baz"])
    assert 1 <= count <= 3  # At least one row expected, not too many due to long interval
Recommended Enhancements and Expansion Tips
To expand the test’s capability and improve framework robustness, consider the following, all compliant with your workspace best practices:

1. Test for CLI Interface
Write a test that uses subprocess to invoke the scriptlet as a CLI command, checking output and result file.

Example:

python
import subprocess

def test_cli_ctx_row_updater():
    proc = subprocess.Popen(
        ["python", "scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_row_updater.py", "--key", "cli_test", "--n", "2", "--interval_sec", "0.1"],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE
    )
    time.sleep(0.3)
    proc.terminate()
    # Optionally check file or log, if modified to output
Add support to the scriptlet for optional run duration and output location for easier testing.

2. Test Data Integrity
Assert that all rows are the correct length, the timestamp format is valid, and values are numeric.

3. Resource Cleanup
Devise a way (hook, event) to stop the updater thread after test completion, or ensure threads do not accumulate in longer test suites.

4. Stress and Edge Case Testing
Simulate extremely short (interval_sec=0.01) or long (interval_sec=5) intervals.

Check behavior when n = 0 or n is very large.

5. Parallel/Concurrent Updaters
Run multiple updaters on different keys simultaneously and assert no interference or cross-talk.

6. Context Integration
Test the updater as used in a real orchestrator run (as part of a complete pipeline), verifying ctx sharing and downstream consumption.

7. Error Handling
Verify that the scriptlet raises or logs appropriate errors when given invalid input types.

8. Performance and Memory Profiling
Use the workspace’s resource tracking facilities to profile the memory and CPU usage of the updater thread in test, confirming there are no leaks or runaways.

9. History Tracking
Ensure that if ctx uses a Context class with history, updated values are properly tracked and exposed by get_history.

10. Document All Test Variants
Maintain extensive docstrings for every test, providing clarity for future contributors.

Summary Table
Aspect	Coverage in Current Test	Expansion Recommendation
Thread Launch	✔️ Verifies thread appends rows	Add explicit thread cleanup
Data Integrity	Checks row count	Add value and length validation
Serializability	Implied by ctx use	Test with actual Context serialization
Resource Impact	❌	Profile with memory/CPU tracking
Parallelism	❌	Test multiple keys/updaters at once
CLI Support	❌	Add CLI subprocess tests
Conclusion
The current test_ctx_row_updater.py does its essential job well: it verifies core data-adding thread functionality.
For a more robust, scalable, and maintainable framework, embrace expanded tests, CLI verification, resource checks, and error handling. These enhancements will ensure all scriptlets—especially those running background or parallel logic—are trustworthy building blocks within your orchestration system.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tests/test_ctx_init.py — Documentation and Expansion Recommendations
Objective
The test module tests/test_ctx_init.py validates the correct operation of the ctx_init scriptlet, ensuring it initializes specified ctx keys as empty lists. This is a critical foundational step for all orchestrator pipelines which rely on predictable, consistent, JSON-serializable context setup before data is populated or manipulated by downstream steps.

Description
test_ctx_init.py serves as an automated unit test targeting the primary function (run) provided by scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_init.py. Its key responsibilities are:

Confirm that after invocation, all specified keys are present in the context and initialized as empty lists.

Check that the function’s return value reports the initialized keys.

Provide a robust guarantee against regression for this essential initialization logic, which underpins shared in-memory data handling among all orchestrator scriptlets and steps.

How it works
Imports the ctx_init module.

Defines a test context (ctx) as a blank dictionary.

Runs the ctx_init.run() function with test keys (e.g., ["foo", "bar"]).

Asserts:

Both keys exist in ctx after function execution.

Both are empty lists.

Return dictionary lists the keys as initialized.

This test is designed for pytest and can be executed via the standard command line.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+ (dict guarantees insertion order, type checking consistent)

pytest (modern, concise unit-testing framework)

scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_init.py must be available and in the Python path.

Minimal Code Example
python
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_init

def test_ctx_init_run():
    ctx = {}
    result = ctx_init.run(ctx, {"keys": ["foo", "bar"]})
    assert "foo" in ctx and "bar" in ctx
    assert ctx["foo"] == []
    assert result["initialized"] == ["foo", "bar"]
Applications & Integration
Pipeline Readiness: Verifies foundational ctx population ability before orchestrator pipelines run—essential for all workflows that rely on step-wise shared memory.

Recipe Safeguards: Ensures that initialization steps in recipes (YAML) produce the intended preconditions for both Python and shell scriptlets.

Continuous Integration (CI): Should be run as part of every commit to guarantee no regressions in core context-manipulation primitives.

Error Detection: Rapidly detects and isolates defects in context initialization, preventing cascading failures during orchestrated recipes.

Educational Utility: Serves as a demo and template for writing future tests for other scriptlets (single-responsibility, CLI-supporting, composable) as mandated by the workspace design.

Limitations
Scope: Tests only the basic initialization (presence and value as empty lists) for specified keys. Does not:

Check behavior with invalid key names (e.g., non-string, or invalid Python identifiers).

Test CLI invocation (only Python API, consistent with UserGuide.md).

Validate threading safety in the event of concurrent initializations.

Assert the absence of side effects on other existing ctx keys.

Test non-default argument combinations or error conditions (e.g., empty keys list, duplicate keys).

Mutation Side Effects: Only available ctx state is tested; history, rollback, or audit trails are not checked (see recommendations below).

Usage Examples
With pytest installed, simply run inside the workspace root or the orchestrator folder:

text
pytest tests/test_ctx_init.py
Sample Customization for Other Keys:

python
def test_ctx_init_multiple():
    ctx = {'preset': [123]}
    keys_to_init = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]
    result = ctx_init.run(ctx, {"keys": keys_to_init})
    for key in keys_to_init:
        assert key in ctx and ctx[key] == []
    assert result["initialized"] == keys_to_init
    # Existing keys remain untouched if not in keys_to_init
    assert ctx["preset"] == [123]
Integration in a Recipe:

A typical orchestrator recipe step (YAML):

text
- name: prepare_ctx_keys
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_init
  function: run
  params:
    keys: ["input_data", "stage_results", "final_report"]
Manual Code Invocation:

python
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_init
ctx = {}
ctx_init.run(ctx, {"keys": ["data_a", "foo_data"]})
Recommendations & Enhancement Tips
To further expand and harden test_ctx_init.py (and the related scriptlet) with best practices and compliance with the workspace’s extensible, robust philosophy:

1. Test Invalid Cases
Test what happens with empty keys, non-string keys, or duplicate entries:

python
def test_ctx_init_empty_keys():
    ctx = {"existing": [1]}
    result = ctx_init.run(ctx, {"keys": []})
    assert ctx == {"existing": [1]}
    assert result["initialized"] == []
2. Check Already-Initialized Keys
Validate idempotence: does re-initializing a present key reset it to an empty list, error, or skip?

Test overwriting behavior, if any.

3. Test CLI Entrypoint
Use subprocess to test CLI: python scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_init.py --keys cli_foo cli_bar.

Capture stdout and verify proper output.

4. Add Negative/Edge Case Coverage
Keys that are invalid identifiers (should fail gracefully, if enforced in scriptlet).

Validate type (should be list after init).

Non-JSON-serializable initialization attempts (extend scriptlet to error/warn optionally).

5. Traceability/Audit
If workspace enables change history (ctx.get_history), test that the init operation is recorded for each key.

6. Test Parallel/Concurrent Init
If planned to allow threaded initialization (future proof), add thread-safety tests.

7. Reporting and Logging
Extend the scriptlet to optionally log initialized keys/actions to ctx["log"], and add assertions in the test.

Verify audit, trace, or step-times integration if workspace adopts more advanced tracking.

8. Schema/Contract Tests
Integrate with validators (e.g., after ctx_init.run, call a schema-checking scriptlet to confirm type contract).

9. Extendable Test Patterns
Parameterize with pytest.mark.parametrize for batch testing of multiple scenarios.

10. Documentation String Check
Optionally, assert that the scriptlet contains a meaningful docstring in the test, protecting documentation quality.

Example: Enhanced Pytest with Parameterization
python
import pytest
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_init

@pytest.mark.parametrize("keys", [
    (["foo"]),
    (["a", "b", "c"]),
    ([]),
])
def test_ctx_init_various(keys):
    ctx = {}
    result = ctx_init.run(ctx, {"keys": keys})
    for key in keys:
        assert key in ctx and ctx[key] == []
    assert set(result["initialized"]) == set(keys)
Conclusion
A strong, well-covered test like test_ctx_init.py is essential for foundational reliability across your orchestrator workflows. Following these recommendations will:

Improve reliability and robustness.

Ease future migration and scriptlet expansion.

Keep the workspace composable, discoverable, and auditable, as outlined by your framework's best practices.

Tip: Use this pattern as a foundation for testing every atomic scriptlet in scriptlets/python/steps/—mirroring the intent that each be “independent, CLI-run, well-documented, and unit-tested” for extensible automation workflows.

hello_dash.py – Comprehensive Documentation
Objective
To provide a reusable, interactive dashboard app (using Dash) that visualizes and monitors live, shared, in-memory context (ctx) data during pipelines run by the orchestrator framework.
It serves as a real-time "window" into the orchestrator's ctx, enabling users to plot, explore, and debug workflow data.

Description
hello_dash.py is a stand-alone Dash web application scriptlet for monitoring, visualizing, and debugging the live in-memory context (ctx), shared between orchestrator steps.

It can be run both independently from the CLI or as a step in an orchestrator recipe.

Its main features include:

Live-updating plot of the column values in a specified ctx key.

Interactive selection of which columns to plot through a dropdown.

Text display of the printed, full current context when data changes.

Options to bind to a specific host and port, allowing for parallel pipeline visualization.

Structure:
The script instantiates a Dash (Plotly) web application with:

A dropdown component for selecting columns to plot.

A Plotly graph to display data.

A <pre> section for stringified ctx output (helpful for debugging).

All code is contained in a single file for ease of scriptlet deployment and recipe inclusion.

Dependencies
Python Packages:

dash (web app)

plotly (interactive chart rendering for Dash)

threading (for background data updating in CLI demo mode)

argparse (command-line argument parsing)

time, datetime, random (support for random/temporal data in demo mode)

Workspace Requirements:

Shared ctx structure, as established by orchestrator.

Recipe or CLI integration for dynamic, live data.

Limitations
Performance: Not intended for very large datasets; all data is loaded into memory and into the browser via Dash/Plotly.

Data Format:

Expects ctx[ctx_key] to be a list of lists:

Each row: [timestamp, val1, val2, ...]

Column 0: Timestamp, columns 1..N: numeric values.

No handling for arbitrary data types; not robust to non-list, empty list, or nested-list edge cases.

Single Key:
Can visualize only one ctx key at a time in the standard recipe.

Persistence:
Does not persist application or user plot state across restarts.

Security:
The server listens on all interfaces (0.0.0.0 by default), with no authentication or protection—meant for internal use only.

Minimal Error Handling:
If data is missing or malformed, plots are simply empty.

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
Recipe Integration Example
Entrypoint in orchestrator recipe step:

text
- name: monitor_and_plot
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.apps.hello_dash
  function: run
  params:
    port: 8050
    ctx_key: "new_row"
This adds a visualization step in a multi-stage data pipeline.

CLI Standalone Example
text
python scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py --port 8050 --ctx_key new_row
Launches the Dash server on port 8050, visualizing the context stored under ctx["new_row"].

In CLI mode, hello_dash.py will start its own background data updater for demonstration:

Every second, a new row [timestamp, random1, random2, random3] is appended.

Live Pipeline Monitoring
Run as part of a pipeline where ctx["new_row"] is being updated in the background (e.g., by ctx_row_updater.py step).

Direct your browser to http://localhost:8050 to see the live chart of the latest data.

User Interactions
Column selection: Users can choose which numeric columns (1, 2, etc) to plot.

Graph: Shows line chart(s) of the selected columns vs timestamp.

Raw ctx: Below the plot, a pre block displays plaintext representation of the most recent ctx content (helpful for debugging).

Detailed Usage Walkthrough
1. Standalone Demo:
text
python scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py --port 8050 --ctx_key test_data
Simulates data population.

View in browser: http://localhost:8050

2. Orchestrator Recipe Context:
Add upstream pipeline steps to update ctx["live_measurements"].

Configure recipe step:

text
- idx: 5
  name: live_measurement_dashboard
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.apps.hello_dash
  function: run
  params:
    port: 8051
    ctx_key: "live_measurements"
Use a different port for each dashboard if running multiple.

3. Advanced Examples:
Change binding host:

text
python scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py --port 9000 --ctx_key my_data --host 127.0.0.1
Multiple pipelines:
Have different dashboards on different ports showing different ctx keys simultaneously.

Tips, Recommendations, and Enhancement Suggestions
1. DataTable Integration:
Add a Dash DataTable (dash_table.DataTable) to display the latest rows of data in tabular form.

2. Real-time Alerts and Notifications:
Integrate Dash Bootstrap Components (dcc.Toast, dbc.Alert) to provide pop-up/live alerts on new data rows, ctx changes, or issue detection.

3. Improved Column Handling and Metadata:

Support for column names/labels rather than simple positional indices if available in the data.

Auto-infer column headers from a "schema", if upstream pipeline steps produce it.

4. Theme and UX Enhancements:

Incorporate Dash Bootstrap Components for visually improved layouts.

Add navigation bar, sidebar for selecting different ctx keys or plot modes.

Support for dark/light themes or custom user themes.

5. Security Improvements:

Add IP filtering or authentication, especially if considering exposure outside localhost.

6. Data Export Feature:

Add a "Download CSV" button to allow the user to export the currently visualized data.

7. Pagination and Filtering for Large Data:

Add page-based viewing or sampling for extremely large datasets to increase performance and reduce browser rendering lag.

8. Custom Plot Types:

Add support for scatter, bar, or histogram plot types, toggleable from UI.

Allow overlaying reference lines or thresholds for alarms.

9. ctx Key Selector:

If multiple ctx datasets are available, provide a dropdown in the Dash UI to switch between them dynamically, rather than launching a new app per key.

10. Historical Context and Debug Views:

Add support for viewing ctx history, diffs over time, or plotting changes over time (if context history is enabled in core).

11. Integration with Recipe Graph / Logs:

Add links or UI panels to view the step sequence graph and recent logs for easier debugging, using files in Assets and Logs.

12. Modularization and Extensibility:

Refactor to allow plug-in components: e.g., dashboard extensions reading configuration from ctx or recipe YAML, following your principle of modularity and independent scriptlets.

13. Dash Callbacks Performance:

For high-frequency updates, consider using a dedicated data polling mechanism or websockets for more responsive realtime data.

14. Error Reporting in UI:

If ctx contains errors, show a red alert and display error contents in the dashboard.

15. Standalone Package and Dockerization:

Package as a standalone entry-point; provide a lightweight Dockerfile for easy deployment and sharing with other teams.

General Best Practices for Expanding This Scriptlet
Every new UI component or callback should have thorough docstrings in the file and follow the workspace convention of usage, description, and limitation documentation.

Avoid storing or passing non-serializable objects via ctx.

Separate core Dash app/plotting logic and data transformation logic for reusability.

Support both orchestrator and CLI/demo contexts interchangeably, with clear, self-documenting code.

Use recipe-driven configuration, so new users can add advanced dashboards by editing their pipeline YAML, rather than touching Python code.

Contribute reusable utilities (e.g., column inferrer, chart helpers) to scriptlets/python/core/ for others to build from.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for scriptlets/python/apps/sample_dash.py
Objective
Provide a simple interactive Dash app as a scriptlet to demonstrate how user input from a Dash UI can be saved into the global shared ctx, how ctx can be logged and dumped for offline debugging, and how Dash callbacks interact with the orchestrator context in a composable step.

Serve as a starting template for more complex dashboard extensions, showing user selection, Dash logging, and context dumps, while encouraging scriptlet portability and reusability.

Description
sample_dash.py is a Dash application scriptlet that creates an interactive user interface for selecting an item from a dropdown menu and saving that selection into the orchestrator’s shared in-memory ctx. When the “Save Selection” button is clicked, the selection is both recorded in ctx and logged via the ctx_logger utility, and a ctx JSON dump is created for debugging. The UI provides real-time feedback indicating successful completion.

Component/Callback Highlights:

Dropdown for item selection

Button for triggering action

Output Div for reporting status

Dash callback logic for:

Updating ctx with user selection

Step-level logging (via ctx_logger)

Debug/context dump to file (ctx_debug_dump)

Real-time feedback display

Scriptlet Pattern:

Designed to run as a stand-alone Dash app (CLI or orchestrator step)

Shows how scriptlets can import and use other core scriptlets (logging, debug dump)

Makes ctx available globally within the Dash app, facilitating stateful orchestration

Dependencies / Requirements
Python >= 3.6

Dash

dash

plotly

Workspace utilities:

ctx_logger (for logging actions to ctx)

ctx_debug_dump (for serializing full ctx for offline analysis)

context.py (provides the global or step-level ctx)

All dependencies should be listed in requirements.txt to ensure reproducibility:

text
dash==2.x.x
plotly==5.x.x
Application, Integration & Usage
Application
Can be run independently (as a quick dashboard)

Integrated as a step in orchestrator YAML recipes (for interactive selection, manual triggers, UI checkpoints)

Used as a template for building more advanced Dash dashboards that interact with ctx

Integration Patterns
CLI (stand-alone use):

text
python scriptlets/python/apps/sample_dash.py
# visit http://127.0.0.1:8050 in your browser
Orchestrator Recipe Step (YAML):

text
- name: user_selection_dashboard
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.apps.sample_dash
  function: main
  params: {}
Import and run as function (from orchestrator or another scriptlet):

python
import scriptlets.python.apps.sample_dash as sample_dash
sample_dash.main(ctx, params)
Debug Mode:

Run the orchestrator with debug enabled and inspect Logs/ctx_after_selection.json for the dumped context after a user selection.

Useful for tracing and troubleshooting UI-driven changes to workflow state.

Detailed Usage Examples
User Flow:

Launch the app (python sample_dash.py)

Dropdown presents options "Item 0" to "Item 4"

User selects an item (e.g., "Item 2")

User clicks "Save Selection" button

App:

Stores the selection in ctx['user_selection']

Logs the action with level INFO

Dumps the entire ctx to Logs/ctx_after_selection.json

Displays a success message: “Selection 2 saved to ctx!”

Chaining Selection for Downstream Steps:
After running the dashboard, any subsequent orchestrator step or scriptlet can access ctx['user_selection'] to determine downstream logic (such as choosing a test scenario or dataset).

Recipe Example:

text
- idx: 1
  name: launch_selection_dash
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.apps.sample_dash
  function: main
  params: {}
- idx: 2
  name: next_step
  type: python
  module: my_scriptlet
  function: run
  params:
    selection: "{{ ctx['user_selection'] }}"
  depends_on: [launch_selection_dash]
# step 2 receives the user’s choice
Limitations
The ctx object must be made available to the Dash app as a global or passed reference; this script assumes it is imported or provided by the orchestrator.

UI is simple: only a dropdown, a button, and a status; no advanced controls or validation.

Not designed for multi-user or concurrent web access (single-user at a time for state fidelity).

No user authentication/authorization implemented (dashboard is open by default).

Does not support persistent storage beyond the current orchestrator run or context dumps.

No error handling for failed writes to ctx or log/dump file I/O.

The items in the dropdown are static (range 0–4); does not support runtime or dynamic item sources without modification.

Real-time updates are scoped to user action; other changes in ctx (e.g., from other threads/steps) are not pushed to the UI without refresh.

Not intended for very large or complex selections/visualizations—serves as a minimal template.

Example Code
python
import dash
from dash import dcc, html, Input, Output, State
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_logger as ctx_logger
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_debug_dump as ctx_debug_dump

# ctx should be made available by orchestrator or provided manually
from context import ctx

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div([
    dcc.Dropdown(
        id='item-dropdown',
        options=[{'label': f'Item {i}', 'value': i} for i in range(5)],
        value=0
    ),
    html.Button('Save Selection', id='save-btn', n_clicks=0),
    html.Div(id='save-status')
])

@app.callback(
    Output('save-status', 'children'),
    Input('save-btn', 'n_clicks'),
    State('item-dropdown', 'value')
)
def save_selection(n_clicks, selected_value):
    if n_clicks > 0:
        # Save selection to ctx
        ctx['user_selection'] = selected_value

        # Log the action using ctx_logger
        ctx_logger.run(ctx, {
            "msg": f"User selected {selected_value}",
            "level": "INFO"
        })

        # Optionally, dump ctx to file for debugging
        ctx_debug_dump.run(ctx, {"out": "Logs/ctx_after_selection.json"})

        return f"Selection {selected_value} saved to ctx!"
    return ""

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(debug=True)
Tips & Recommendations: Expansion and Framework Enhancement
1. Parameterize Dropdown:
Accept the dropdown item list as a parameter (from params or ctx), making component dynamic for various use cases.

Example params:

text
params:
  items: ["A", "B", "C"]
Update code to read items from params['items'] or a default.

2. Support DataTable and Multi-Select:
Add a DataTable below the dropdown to visualize ctx contents (e.g., user history or previous result sets).

Enable multi-select and store a list in ctx.

3. Error Handling / Input Validation:
Add error boundary for failed ctx updates, file I/O, or invalid selections.

Show error messages in the UI, and optionally log those to ctx['log'].

4. Context/State Sync:
Add periodic polling or websocket support so the UI can react in real-time to ctx changes originating from outside the Dash app.

5. User Authentication/Access Control:
Integrate Dash authentication (e.g., with dash-auth) for scenarios requiring restricted access.

6. Notification and Alert Extensions:
Use the alert and notification scriptlet pattern in the UI (as per the workspace’s advanced Dash notification recipes) to alert users when state changes, step fails, or events trigger.

7. Multi-Step Interaction:
Chain several user inputs or stages (e.g., multi-page wizard), saving progress to ctx at each stage.

Display workflow progress/status in the UI—possibly drawing from ctx['trace'] or ctx['audit'].

8. Advanced Logging/Debugging:
Add a section to read and display recent logs from ctx['log'] or Logs/.

Allow users to trigger a "debug snapshot" button to force a context dump.

9. Custom Output Hooks:
Allow the callback to optionally trigger another scriptlet, based on the selection (e.g., launching a report generator, data fetch, etc.).

Example: Save selection, then run a report and notify via Slack/email (ctx_notify or ctx_notify_advanced).

10. Adopt Bootstrap Components:
Improve UI with Bootstrap components (dash-bootstrap-components) for better layout, alerts, modals, or navbars, as per your advanced Dash enhancement modules.

11. Test Coverage and CLI/Modularity:
Add unit tests (tests/test_sample_dash.py) for key callbacks and context integration.

Refactor the app so it can be initialized with any externally-provided ctx (not just imported), improving reusability in composite workflows.

Summary:
sample_dash.py serves as an effective entry point and instructional template for UI-driven orchestrator steps, illustrating context interaction, runtime logging, and composable scriptlet design. Expanding the interface, error handling, and parameterization—while aligning with framework best practices—can transition this from a minimal demo into a robust, reusable, and extensible dashboard snippet for many automation flows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_step_timer.py — Comprehensive Documentation
Objective
To provide a standard, traceable, and reusable way to time and log the duration of each step (or block of code) during orchestrator workflow execution. This serves to enable resource and performance monitoring, facilitate audit trails, and inform optimization.

Detailed Description
ctx_step_timer.py defines a context manager—step_timer(ctx, step_name)—that records the start and end timestamps and calculates the elapsed duration any time a recipe step (or arbitrary code block) is executed within its context. The timing information is automatically appended to the shared in-memory ctx under the key ctx["step_times"], ensuring duration logs are available to any further steps, logs, audits, or dashboards.

Each with step_timer(ctx, "some_step"): block will register a dict to ctx["step_times"] with:

"step": Name or label for the step being timed.

"start": Epoch timestamp at step start.

"end": Epoch timestamp at end.

"duration": Step runtime (seconds, float).

This enables any pipeline or substep, whether from a recipe, CLI, or API-driven use, to be instrumented for time profiling in a standardized and composable fashion.

Dependencies
Standard Library:

time

contextlib (for contextmanager)

orchestrator framework requirement:

Assumes the use of a JSON-serializable ctx dictionary (dict subclass, e.g., Context from context.py).

No external packages required; Python 3.6+ recommended for compatibility.

Applications & Integrations
Step timing for recipe steps:
Integrate with step_timer(ctx, "step_name") in any Python scriptlet function or in orchestrator steps to collect step-level durations.

Performance reporting:
Data in ctx["step_times"] can be displayed on Dash dashboards, included in logs/reports, or used for identifying pipeline bottlenecks.

Audit trail:
Timings automatically provide an audit trail for each step’s execution (start/end/elapsed) for compliance and debugging.

Integration with logging/tools:
Output of this module can be cross-referenced with ctx_logger.py and ctx_audit_report.py or other utilities.

Limitations
No memory or CPU usage logging:
It only tracks wall-clock time; does not record memory or CPU use. For combined profiling, use with ctx_profiler.py or ctx_resource_monitor.py.

Granularity:
Resolution is to seconds (or subsecond, as float), but does not capture finer-grained events or async actions well.

Not exception aware:
It will record duration even if an exception is raised (as the context manager’s body is entered/exited), but does not record exceptions, only timings.

Requires manual instrumentation:
The developer or recipe designer must wrap steps/code with step_timer.

No built-in visualization:
It just adds to ctx—visualization is left to downstream tools.

Usage
Below are detailed usage examples compliant with this workspace's examples and conventions.

1. Wrapping a function or block inside a Python scriptlet
python
from scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_step_timer import step_timer

def run(ctx, params):
    with step_timer(ctx, "data_loading"):
        # Simulate a data load or transformation
        data = [i ** 2 for i in range(10000)]
        ctx["squared_data"] = data
    return {"done": True}
2. Applied within an orchestrator recipe step
text
- idx: 1
  name: compute_things
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.compute_script
  function: run
  params:
    foo: 123
    bar: 456
And in compute_script.py:

python
from scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_step_timer import step_timer

def run(ctx, params):
    with step_timer(ctx, "compute_things"):
        result = params["foo"] + params["bar"]
        ctx["sum"] = result
    return {"result": result}
3. Directly logging step times for audit/debug
python
# Print the step timings after the run (in any script).
import json
print(json.dumps(ctx.get("step_times", []), indent=2))
Output sample:

json
[
  {
    "step": "compute_things",
    "start": 1690000000.123,
    "end": 1690000000.222,
    "duration": 0.099
  }
]
4. Multiple timing sections in a single scriptlet
python
def run(ctx, params):
    with step_timer(ctx, "load_part1"):
        # Load part 1
        ctx["p1"] = sum(range(50000))
    with step_timer(ctx, "load_part2"):
        # Load part 2
        ctx["p2"] = max(range(60000))
    return {}
5. Use with exception handling
python
def run(ctx, params):
    try:
        with step_timer(ctx, "unstable_step"):
            # Might raise an error
            risky()
    except Exception as e:
        ctx["error"] = str(e)
The timing will still be logged even on failure.

Recommendations & Tips for Enhancement
Extend for CPU/memory/resource monitoring:

Combine with ctx_profiler.py or add new options to optionally log memory/CPU deltas for each timed block.

Add Step Outcome Status:

Record success/failure (add "status" field, “ok” or “error”) for richer audit trails.

Support Nested Step Timings:

Allow children steps/sections and hierarchical timing (e.g., parent.step.substep), recording nesting or “parent” context.

Integration with Logging Utility:

On exit, automatically call a standardized logger (like ctx_logger.py) to append a log line for visibility.

Allow Decorator Usage:

Provide a decorator:

python
@step_timer_decorator(ctx, "step_name")
def step_fn(ctx, params):
    ...
Support for Async Code and Awaitables:

Provide an async-compatible context manager for timing async tasks/coroutines.

Expose Automatic Timing in Runner:

Make runner.py optionally wrap every step by timing (with opt-out per step), to ensure all steps—even shell ones—are timed when possible.

Add Error Message and Exception Traceback Fields:

For steps which fail, provide an "error" field capturing the exception message and possibly a "traceback" key.

Export/Save Timings as CSV or JSON:

Add a utility to dump ctx["step_times"] as a file via ctx_to_file.py for external consumption.

Documentation and Discoverability:

Use the recipe/documentation auto-generation guidelines from README.md and UserGuide.md to include this module and all its parameters in “available scriptlets” lists.

Summary Table
Field	Description
step	Name/label of the step timed
start	Wall-clock timestamp at start (float, seconds since epoch)
end	Wall-clock timestamp at end (float)
duration	Elapsed runtime in seconds (float)
Cross-References
For capturing CPU/memory, see ctx_profiler.py, ctx_resource_monitor.py.

For logging, see ctx_logger.py.

For audit reports, see ctx_audit_report.py.

For decorators and error handling, see ctx_error_handler.py, ctx_trace_step.py.

Compliance Notice
All enhancements, changes, and wrappers should:

Be composable (do not require invasive changes in orchestrator core).

Ensure traceability (who/what/when/old/new) for all ctx changes.

Remain independent and reusable; do not break backward compatibility.

Adhere to the workspace’s detailed docstring/commenting standards.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_step_rollback_point.py
Location: orchestrator/scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_step_rollback_point.py
Objective
To provide a lightweight, composable mechanism for marking ("snapshotting") rollback points in the shared in-memory context (ctx) during orchestrator runs and to enable restoring ctx to a previous saved state if needed. This supports safe, auditable, and reversible pipeline execution, especially useful in multi-step or long-running test, analysis, or reporting flows.

Description
What it does:

Adds ("marks") rollback points in the in-memory ctx as deep copies (serialized, so only JSON-serializable objects!).

Allows steps in subsequent recipe stages to "restore" ctx from the latest or specifically-named rollback point.

How it works:

Stores a complete deep copy of the entire globally shared ctx under a user-specified key (default: "rollback_point").

Restores the full context (removes all current keys and replaces with the saved checkpoint) using that same key.

Designed as a composable/atomic python scriptlet, following workspace conventions:

Callable via run(ctx, params)

Docstring explains usage, limitations, arguments.

Meant for inclusion in orchestrator recipes and direct CLI testing.

Dependencies / Requirements
Python: 3.6+

Standard Library:

copy for deep copy (copy.deepcopy)

Orchestrator Framework:

Shared ctx: In-memory, JSON-serializable, traceable.

No Third-party: This scriptlet relies only on Python standard modules.

Applications / Integration
A. As a Step in Recipes
Use for:

Marking logical rollback/safe-points before risky or experimental steps.

Reverting ctx to a previous state after errors, failed experiments, or to enable repeatable runs without rerunning prior steps.

Sample Recipe Snippet:

text
- idx: 3
  name: mark_rollback
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_step_rollback_point
  function: run
  params:
    action: mark
    out: "rollback_point_before_cleaning"
- idx: 4
  name: risky_data_cleaning
  ...
- idx: 5
  name: restore_rollback_if_error
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_step_rollback_point
  function: run
  params:
    action: restore
    in: "rollback_point_before_cleaning"
B. CLI / Direct Python Usage
Marking a rollback point:

python
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_step_rollback_point
ctx = {"A": 1, "B": [1, 2, 3]}
result = ctx_step_rollback_point.run(ctx, {"action": "mark", "out": "my_rollback_point"})
# ctx now contains "my_rollback_point" as a deep copy of the full ctx BEFORE further changes
Restoring to a rollback point:

python
# Assume ctx has changed
result = ctx_step_rollback_point.run(ctx, {"action": "restore", "in": "my_rollback_point"})
# ctx is now returned to its state at the time of "mark"
C. Integration with Error Handling
Best paired with error handler steps:
Mark before steps likely to fail, then in error/catch, restore to the last good checkpoint.

D. For Debugging and Data Forensics
Use to explore and compare different states of ctx, audit data provenance, or allow retracing failed workflows.

Limitations
In-memory Only: Rollback points live in RAM (not disk). Lost if the orchestrator process dies or is restarted.

Serialization: Only JSON-serializable objects (as required by ctx) are included in the deep copy.

No incremental/partial rollback: Always the full ctx is snapshotted/restored, not partial keys by default.

Only latest saved snapshot per key: Each "out" key saves only the latest rollback at that key.

Not versioned: No built-in multi-stage or chronological history (only single-point per-snapshot key; later marks with the same key overwrite the earlier).

No automatic error-triggered rollback: Must be invoked manually in the recipe or workflow logic.

Usage Examples
A. Mark and Restore Named Rollback Point

python
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_step_rollback_point
ctx = {"foo": 123, "bar": [1,2,3]}
# Mark
result = ctx_step_rollback_point.run(ctx, {"action": "mark", "out": "rollback_before_transform"})
# Change ctx
ctx["bar"].append(4)
# Restore
ctx_step_rollback_point.run(ctx, {"action": "restore", "in": "rollback_before_transform"})
# ctx["bar"] is now [1,2,3] again
B. Default Usage (No Key Provided)

python
ctx = {...}
ctx_step_rollback_point.run(ctx, {"action": "mark"})
# saves under key 'rollback_point'
...
ctx_step_rollback_point.run(ctx, {"action": "restore"})
# resets ctx to last 'rollback_point'
C. Example in Orchestrator Recipe

1. Multi-Point/Versioned Rollbacks

Add chronological history:
Maintain a rolling list under each snapshot key, not just a single snapshot. Allow restore by timestamp or index.

python
# Example param: {"action": "mark", "out": "experiment", "history": True}
# Restore: {"action": "restore", "in": "experiment", "idx": -2}
2. Disk-Based Snapshots

Persist rollback points to file (Data/rollback_point_{timestamp}.json) for robustness against process crashes.

3. Selective/Partial Key Rollback

Allow marking/restoring only a subset of ctx keys (pass keys in params). Useful for large or partitioned ctx.

4. Auto-Rollback Integration

Recipe/step decorator or orchestrator flag to auto-restore to last rollback on error (combine with error_hook).

5. CLI Interface

Make script CLI-runnable, like many other core scriptlets in the workspace.

6. Metadata and Auditing

Attach timestamp, user, reason/note to each snapshot for clearer traceability.

{"action": "mark", "out": ..., "meta": {"reason": "pre-clean backup"}}

7. Rollback Diff/Preview

Add a "preview_diff" action to see (and log) what would be reverted before restore is executed.

8. Notification on Rollback

Optionally integrate with notification scriptlets (slack/email) to notify operator/team.

E.g., "Restored to rollback_point due to error in step xyz."

9. Integrate with ctx get_history/trace system

When restoring, log the action clearly in ctx trace/audit logs for future reproducibility.

Tips & Best Practices
Always mark a rollback before experimental or high-impact steps.

Use meaningful, unique keys for each rollback point, especially in recipes with many branches.

Combine with proper error handling and logging—ensure failed recoveries log root causes.

Document rollback points in recipe YAML comments for clarity.

Save to disk if session state must be restorable across orchestrator failures (can be an enhancement).

Periodically clean up outdated rollback points if they may cause resource/memory bloat.

In summary:
ctx_step_rollback_point.py is a crucial utility in your automation/orchestrator workflow. It enables robust checkpointing, makes your recipes safer, and opens the door to advanced error recovery, iterative experiment management, and reproducible runs. Following the above recommendations will keep it both backward-compatible and constantly evolving alongside your growing automation framework!

--------------------------------------------------------
ctx_step_retry.py ­— Framework-Compliant Documentation
Objective
The goal of ctx_step_retry.py is to provide a robust mechanism to retry a scriptlet step (or arbitrary callable) on failure, with exponential backoff between retries, and to be used as a utility that can "wrap" unreliable functions or steps in your orchestrator pipeline. This utility is crucial when dealing with steps that may occasionally fail due to non-critical, recoverable errors (e.g., transient network failures, temporary resource limitations, or flaky external dependencies).

Description
What It Does:
This scriptlet attempts to invoke a provided callable (usually a function reference or step) with specified arguments. If the call fails (raises an exception), it will wait for a backoff period and then try again, up to a maximum number of times (retries). The backoff increases exponentially to avoid hammering resources or services. The scriptlet is fully context (ctx)-integrated and can be used as an atomic step in a recipe or as a reusable utility for other scriptlets.

Return Value:

On success, returns the function result and the (1-based) attempt number at which it succeeded.

On total failure, raises the final exception (unless caught by a higher-level error handler).

Integration:

Callable from orchestrator recipes as a step or substep

Usable by other scriptlets via import and direct invocation

Accepts any context-agnostic Python callable for generality

Serializability:
All arguments and results must be JSON-serializable if integration with ctx is desired. Avoid passing non-serializable closures or objects.

Source Code (for Reference)
python
"""
ctx_step_retry.py
-----------------
Retries a step on failure, with exponential backoff.

Usage:
    run(ctx, {"fn": my_fn, "args": {...}, "retries": 3, "delay": 2})

Description:
    - Calls fn(**args), retries up to N times on exception.
"""
import time

def run(ctx, params):
    fn = params["fn"]
    args = params.get("args", {})
    retries = params.get("retries", 3)
    delay = params.get("delay", 2)
    for attempt in range(retries):
        try:
            return {"result": fn(**args), "attempt": attempt+1}
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(delay * (2 ** attempt))
    return {"error": "unreachable"}
Dependencies
Python 3.6+

Standard Python library:

time (for sleep/backoff)

No extra dependencies

The function (fn) you pass must be importable in the invoking context.

Applications and Integrations
Orchestrator Recipe Step (YAML)
You can use this scriptlet as a retry "wrapper" inside a larger Python-based orchestrator recipe by calling it explicitly.

Example: Retrying a data fetcher step

text
- name: fetch_data_with_retry
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_step_retry
  function: run
  params:
    fn: scriptlets.python.steps.data_fetcher.run  # Must be importable
    args:
      url: "https://service/api/data"
    retries: 5
    delay: 1
Note: For orchestration, you may need to wrap your callable appropriately or build a small wrapper scriptlet that enables passing functions by name (due to YAML serialization limitations).

Direct Python Usage in Custom Scriptlet
python
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_step_retry

def flaky_network_op(url, n):
    # simulate occasional network failure
    import random
    if random.random() < 0.7:
        raise RuntimeError("Temporary failure")
    return {"value": n*2, "source": url}

ctx = {}
params = {
    "fn": flaky_network_op,
    "args": {"url": "http://myapi.com/data", "n": 5},
    "retries": 4,
    "delay": 1
}
result = ctx_step_retry.run(ctx, params)
print(result)  # Might succeed on attempt 1~4, or raise on final failure.
As a Utility for Other Scriptlets (Composed Retry Handling)
You can use it to protect any callable/scriptlet in your custom step, for example:

python
def safe_fetch(ctx, params):
    from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_step_retry
    def fetch_row():
        # custom fetch logic
        ...
    retry_params = {"fn": fetch_row, "retries": 3, "delay": 3}
    return ctx_step_retry.run(ctx, retry_params)
Limitations
Function Serialization:

Only callable functions available in the current Python session/context can be referenced as fn.

Cannot serialize closures or lambdas through YAML for direct recipe step use; must register them statically in your workspace or wrap with a named scriptlet.

Exception Handling:

On final failure, the scriptlet will re-raise the exception (unless wrapped by another orchestrator or error handler).

No automatic logging of failed attempts, unless the outer script handles it.

Ctx Integration:

The scriptlet itself only returns a result dictionary; does not directly mutate ctx unless called from a context-aware outer script.

No built-in trace of retries (could be expanded as a feature).

No Support for Asynchronous/Process-Based Functions:
Only synchronous callables with blocking execution are supported.

No Timeout per Retry:
If your function may hang, wrap it yourself with a timeout handler.

Rich Usage Examples
Example 1: Retrying a Shell Scriptlet
Suppose you want to retry a shell ping script through Python:

python
def shell_ping():
    import subprocess
    ret = subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "1", "8.8.8.8"], capture_output=True)
    if ret.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError("Ping failed")
    return ret.stdout

ctx_step_retry.run(None, {
    "fn": shell_ping,
    "retries": 5,
    "delay": 2
})
Example 2: Retrying a Web API Call
python
def api_get():
    import requests
    r = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/status/500")
    if not r.ok:
        raise RuntimeError("API is down")
    return r.json()

result = ctx_step_retry.run({}, {"fn": api_get, "retries": 3, "delay": 3})
Example 3: Retry with Dynamic Delay
python
def flaky():
    import random
    if random.random() > 0.2:
        raise ValueError("not yet!")
    return "OK"

ctx_step_retry.run({}, {"fn": flaky, "retries": 5, "delay": 1})
Recommendations & Suggestions for Expansion
To greatly enhance the usefulness and compliance of this scriptlet with your orchestrator framework, consider:

1. Add Logging and Trace Integration
Store each retry attempt, result, and error in ctx["trace"] or ctx["log"] with timestamp, function, parameters, error details.

Example:

python
if "log" in ctx:
    ctx["log"].append({
        "timestamp": time.time(), "step": fn.__name__,
        "attempt": attempt+1, "status": "fail", "error": str(e)
    })
This improves observability, is crucial for debugging, and aligns with orchestrator traceability.

2. Support Timeout Per Attempt
Add timeout parameter to abort stuck functions (using threading or signal if applicable).

E.g., "timeout": 20 (seconds)

Optionally kill and log hung attempts.

3. Expose Final Error & Attempt Count in ctx
Store ctx["last_retry_status"] or similar so that downstream steps can check if a function eventually failed, or why/how many attempts it took.

4. Flexible Backoff Policy
Allow policy control: exponential, linear, or custom.

Support "max_delay", "backoff_multiplier" parameters.

5. Dynamic Parameter Updates Per Retry
Allow user to adjust args between retries—e.g., to rotate credentials, change URLs, increase polling intervals.

This could also support user-provided hooks: e.g., on_retry callback.

6. Recipe Step Name/Logging Context
Add a step_name param to help log which higher-level step is being retried, improving audit trail.

7. Advanced Exception Handling
Allow user to specify which exceptions to retry vs to fail immediately, e.g.:

python
"retry_exceptions": ["ConnectionError", "TimeoutError"]
8. Integrate With ctx Error Handler Utility
Wrap attempts in the orchestrator's error_handler for standardized logging and ctx["errors"] population.

Summary Table

Aspect	Supported	Recommendations
Retry/Backoff	Exponential	Make policy flexible; add max delay
Logging	Not built-in	Integrate with ctx["log"], ctx["trace"]
ctx updates	Manual	Add optional writing of status/attempt logs
Function type	Synchronous only	Consider async or process-based for CPUs
Args per retry	Static	Allow dynamic update or on_retry hook
Serialization	Importable only	Provide registry for named functions
Exceptions	All	Allow user to choose which to retry
Timeout	Not supported	Add per-attempt timeout parameter
Best Practices & Expansion Tips
Always document functions used as fn for retry compatibility and traceability.

Pass all data (results, error messages, attempt counts) through ctx for audit and analysis.

Use as a utility and compose with other error-handling scriptlets (ctx_error_handler) for comprehensive, unified orchestration.

When adding logging, use the workspace’s centralized logger or audit utilities (ctx_logger.py, ctx_trace, ctx_step_audit).

For high-availability steps, combine retry with queueing, parallel, or failover scriptlets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_step_dependency.py — Step Dependency Analyzer for Orchestrator Recipes
Objective
The main purpose of ctx_step_dependency.py is to analyze, extract, and document the dependency structure
(i.e., "what steps depend on which other steps") from Orchestrator recipe YAMLs. This step analysis is critical for:

Understanding execution order and preconditions for each step.

Automated checks for “deadlocks” or disconnected steps.

Supporting graph visualization tools (e.g., for use in Dash dashboards or Assets/graph.png).

Enabling robust CLI and automation workflows where dynamic step selection or reordering may occur.

Description
What it does:
Reads a recipe YAML file, parses the list of steps, and builds a dependency map for each step.

How:
Each step in the recipe typically defines a name and, optionally, a depends_on or after list which holds dependencies (names of other required steps).

Output:
The result is a dictionary mapping each step’s name to a list (may be empty) of the names of steps it depends on.
This dictionary is then stored in the shared orchestrator context (ctx) under the specified output key.

Integration:
This scriptlet can be added as a step in any recipe, or run as a CLI, to quickly analyze and publish the recipe dependency graph for downstream visualization, audits, validation, or automation.

Scriptlet Code (from workspace)
python
"""
ctx_step_dependency.py
---------------------
Analyzes and lists step dependencies in a recipe.

Usage:
    run(ctx, {"recipe": "recipes/my_recipe.yaml", "out": "step_deps"})

Description:
    - Stores a dict of step dependencies in ctx[out].
"""
import yaml

def run(ctx, params):
    with open(params["recipe"]) as f:
        recipe = yaml.safe_load(f)
    steps = recipe.get("steps", [])
    deps = {}
    for step in steps:
        name = step["name"]
        after = step.get("after", [])
        deps[name] = after
    ctx[params["out"]] = deps
    return {"dependencies": params["out"]}
Dependencies
Python standard library:

yaml (requires pyyaml as in your requirements)

External files:

Expects a proper Orchestrator recipe YAML with a steps: list section.

Shared context:

Needs access to the orchestrator context (ctx) to store the dependencies output.

Applications & Integrations
Automation Pipeline Design:
Quickly check or visualize complex dependency chains for recursive, parallel, or conditional workflows.

Pre-run validation:
Detect missing dependencies, circularity, or unreachable steps before pipeline execution.

Visualization:
Feed the structure into tools or scriptlets that generate workflow DAGs (e.g., ctx_workflow_viz.py).

Documentation/Audit:
Automatically list dependencies in generated process reports or dashboards (e.g., for auditing, onboarding, or compliance).

Conditionally skip/fork:
As a foundation for smarter runtime adjustments (e.g., skip all steps not needed due to dependency context).

Dynamic recipes:
Useful for frameworks that programmatically build or alter recipes at runtime, ensuring the resulting structure is valid.

Limitations
Key Name for Dependencies:
This scriptlet currently looks for an after field, but in your workspace, the standard is depends_on.
You must update it to parse depends_on (or make it flexible).

No Validation:
Does not check if all dependencies are valid (i.e., if all names in depends_on/after exist in step names).

No Cycle Detection:
Does not check for circular dependencies or deadlocks—only parses.

No Advanced Features:
Does not support conditional execution, alternative branches, or other control-flow features (these would require expansion).

Only Top-Level:
Only looks at the immediate depends_on/after field for each step, not nested/external conditions.

YAML Compliance:
Expects recipe YAML to strictly match your orchestrator’s schema.

Detailed Usage Examples
1. In-Recipe Step (as part of YAML)
text
- idx: 99
  name: analyze_step_deps
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_step_dependency
  function: run
  params:
    recipe: "recipes/my_pipeline.yaml"
    out: "step_deps"
After execution, ctx["step_deps"] will have:

python
{
  "step1": [],
  "step2": ["step1"],          # step2 depends on step1
  "step3": ["step1", "step2"], # step3 depends on step1 and step2
  ...
}
2. Python API (from code/interactive session)
python
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_step_dependency

ctx = {}
params = {
  "recipe": "recipes/my_recipe.yaml",
  "out": "my_deps"
}
result = ctx_step_dependency.run(ctx, params)
print(ctx["my_deps"])
3. CLI Usage (if wrapped, e.g. as python ctx_step_dependency.py)
text
python scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_step_dependency.py --recipe recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml --out step_deps
# (You may need to add an argument parser to expose as CLI)
4. Integrated with Visualization
In combination with a graph generation scriptlet (ctx_workflow_viz.py):

python
run(ctx, {
  "recipe": "recipes/my_recipe.yaml",
  "out": "step_graph.png"
})
# uses ctx["step_deps"] as input for the graph structure
5. Debug/deadlock check or as Dashboard Table
After the scriptlet runs, you can easily display all direct step dependencies in Dash or generate audit tables for documentation.

Recommendations & Expansion Suggestions
A. Compliance & Robustness
Support Both depends_on and after:
Check for both keys in each step, favoring depends_on as per your workspace standard.

Validate Step Names:
Warn or raise errors if a dependency name does not correspond to any defined step.

Detect and Warn on Cycles:
Add a function to detect circular dependencies, and fail gracefully with a clear error in ctx["errors"].

CLI Entry-Point:
Add CLI argument parsing so the scriptlet is directly runnable and writes output to a file as well as ctx.

B. Feature Extensions
Full Dependency Tree per Step:
Optionally compute all indirect dependencies for each step (i.e., steps needed recursively), not just direct.

Reverse Dependencies:
Also map which steps are dependent on the current step (“who needs me?”)—good for visualizations.

DOT/Graphviz Export:
Write a method to output the dependency dict as a .dot graph for direct graphviz visualization.

Dependency Groups/Tags:
Handle more complex recipe layouts (e.g., groups of steps that must all complete before dependent step runs).

Integration with Audit and Trace:
Log each discovered dependency and any anomalies to ctx["audit"] or ctx["trace"].

Configurable Field Names:
Allow configuration for alternative field names if other people use slightly different YAML conventions.

In-Recipe Dependency Correction:
Optionally auto-correct missing/typo’d dependency names or at least suggest possible matches.

Step Execution Ordering Tool:
Provide a utility to automatically generate a valid execution order (a topological sort) to help with dynamic pipelines.

C. Documentation & CI
Auto-Generate Dependency Reports:
At each run, dump markdown/HTML table of dependencies to Assets/ or Logs/.

Include in Unit/Integration Test Suite:
Add tests that ensure new/modified recipes have valid, cycle-free dependencies.

Recipe Linter:
Evolve scriptlet into a general “recipe linter” that also checks for other scriptlet/param best-practices.

Summary Table (for quick reference)
Aspect	Supported (Current)	Enhancement Suggestions
Field Support	after	Support depends_on (workspace std.)
Cycle Detection	❌	Add detection & error reporting
CLI	❌ (needs parser)	Add argument parser
Validate Names	❌	Check for undefined deps
Output	ctx[{out key}]	Also file, graph, reports
Visual Outputs	Manual, indirect	Dot/graphviz, markdown tables, Dash
Documentation	Minimal	Expand docstring, usage, edge cases
Best Practices Summary
Always check for both depends_on and after.

Document your recipes’ steps with clear dependency chains.

Test new recipes for cycles and missing dependencies.

Use dependency outputs to drive audit and process documentation.

Expand only in modular, backward-compatible ways (wrapper, never rewrite).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File: scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_step_audit.py
Objective
To log every step execution, including inputs (parameters), outputs, status (success/failure), errors (if any), start/end time, and duration, into the orchestrator’s shared context (ctx["audit"]).

To provide step-level audit trails for full traceability, debugging, and reporting in orchestrator automation workflows.

Description
This scriptlet implements a context manager (step_audit(ctx, step_name, params)) for wrapping the execution of pipeline steps or scriptlet runs.

Usage of this context manager automatically records audit entries at the start and end (including exceptions) of a step’s execution.

Each entry in ctx["audit"] includes:

step: Name of the step being executed.

params: Parameters (inputs) provided to the step.

start: UNIX timestamp when step started.

end: UNIX timestamp when step completed.

duration: Total seconds elapsed.

status: "success" or "error".

error (optional): Error message if an exception occurs.

This audit log enables:

Human-readable proof of the workflow, usually for compliance, debugging, and troubleshooting.

Easy extraction of audit information for summaries, reports, or dashboards.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library

time – for timestamps and duration calculations.

contextlib – for creating the context manager.

Orchestrator context (ctx)

Must support typical dict operations (compatible with the provided Context class).

No third-party packages or external services are required.

Applications and Integrations
Applications:

Pipeline Auditing: Ensures every step in a recipe is logged for after-the-fact diagnostics.

Debugging Support: Facilitates traceback of failed/erroneous runs by examining ctx["audit"].

Reproducibility: Allows for reconstructing how data and state changed, supporting the framework’s traceability goals.

Reporting: ctx["audit"] can be processed for Markdown, Excel, or dashboard reports (e.g., by ctx_audit_report.py).

Integrations:

Any orchestrator recipe step: Wrap Python step code with the context manager.

Other ctx-driven reporting or analysis tools: Read and visualize ctx["audit"].

Limitations
Manual Usage Required: As a context manager, it must be manually used with a with statement in scriptlet code. If omitted, the step is not audited.

Python Steps Only: Cannot automatically audit shell steps or external commands unless explicitly wrapped from Python.

No Deep Output Capture: Only initial input params are guaranteed to be logged. Output (result) is not automatically stored unless manually added to the audit entry.

Audit Persistence: Entries are held in-memory in ctx["audit"] unless further persisted by the workflow; may be lost if not saved.

Multiplicity: If multiple steps with the same name run in parallel, audit may be less clear without additional disambiguation.

Error Message Only, No Traceback: Logs only the error string, not the full traceback (although runner.py may log this separately).

Usage
In a Scriptlet Step
python
from scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_step_audit import step_audit

def run(ctx, params):
    with step_audit(ctx, "foo_process", params):
        # main logic here
        ctx["foo"] = params["data"] * 2
Manual Example
python
from scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_step_audit import step_audit

try:
    with step_audit(ctx, "data_ingest", {"file": "input.csv"}):
        # Simulated code block that could fail
        data = open("input.csv").read()
        if "bad" in data:
            raise Exception("Data corrupted")
        ctx["loaded_data"] = data
except Exception as err:
    print("Step failed, audit log populated automatically:", err)
This will append to ctx["audit"] an entry with:

The step name (data_ingest)

Parameters ({"file": "input.csv"})

Start time, end time, duration

Status: "success" or "error"

If error: error string

Recipe Step Integration
In a Python step referenced by a recipe, wrap the main logic with step_audit:

text
- idx: 4
  name: load_and_check_data
  type: python
  module: myproject.steps.load_data
  function: run
  params:
    file: input.csv
Corresponding run():

python
def run(ctx, params):
    from scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_step_audit import step_audit
    with step_audit(ctx, "load_and_check_data", params):
        # ... step code ...
Viewing the Audit Log
After running a recipe, inspect ctx["audit"]:

python
for entry in ctx["audit"]:
    print(entry)
Fields: step, params, status, start, end, duration, optional error.

Detailed Example Scenario
Suppose you want every step in a custom scriptlet to be audited:

python
from scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_step_audit import step_audit

def run(ctx, params):
    with step_audit(ctx, "clean_csv_rows", params):
        # Example transformation
        cleaned = [row for row in params["rows"] if row.strip()]
        ctx["cleaned_rows"] = cleaned
        if not cleaned:
            raise ValueError("All rows removed (empty dataset)")
When run with params={"rows": ['foo', '', 'bar']}, the audit log might look like:

python
{
  'step': 'clean_csv_rows',
  'params': {'rows': ['foo', '', 'bar']},
  'status': 'success',
  'start': 1693042800.22,
  'end': 1693042800.23,
  'duration': 0.01
}
If all rows are empty, audit entry status would be "error" and include an "error" field.

Enhancement Recommendations
1. Output Capture

Optionally allow capturing step outputs or selected result data. Possible by extending the context manager to accept (or log) outputs when the with block exits.

2. Traceback Logging

Capture and log not just error messages but also full Python traceback in the audit entry for richer post-mortem debugging.

3. Unique Step Instance IDs

Add a field for unique instance/run ID (e.g., timestamp or UUID) for each audit entry, enabling correlation in parallel or repeated step executions.

4. External Audit/Export Hooks

Support optional callbacks/hooks to persist audit entries to file or database as soon as they’re logged, ensuring no in-memory-only limitation.

5. Decorator API

Provide a decorator version (@audit_step(ctx, "step_name")) for composability:

python
@audit_step(ctx, "process_rows")
def process(ctx, params):
    ...
6. User/Executor Field

Allow optionally recording the user or process/executor that ran the step for multi-user or distributed orchestrators.

7. Configurable Verbosity

Add parameters to toggle logging of inputs/outputs, environment, or resource usage per step.

8. Compliance with Central Logging

Optionally integrate with a central Logger utility (see framework enhancement goals) to support multi-destination audit logging—file, stdlog, or DB.

9. Audit Filtering/Search

Provide CLI or script utilities to extract, filter, and summarize the audit log (by step name, status, duration, etc.).

10. Easy Integration with Orchestrator Core

Suggest orchestrator’s runner.py automatically apply this context manager to every Python step, unless explicitly opted out, encouraging universal audit coverage.

Tips for Effective Use
Always wrap critical step logic in with step_audit(...) for irreproachable traceability.

Document expected inputs and outputs so audit log entries are interpretable.

After workflow runs, persist or back up ctx["audit"] to avoid loss.

Use the audit log in combination with error logs for root cause analysis.

Consider building a summary view—e.g., in a Dash dashboard or Markdown—for easier human review.

Summary Table
Field	Description
step	Step or function name
params	Input parameters (as provided to the step)
status	"success" or "error"
start	Timestamp (float, UNIX epoch seconds) at start
end	Timestamp at completion/exception
duration	Seconds elapsed (float)
error	Error string (present if status == "error")
If you want an enhanced code version implementing some of these suggestions or need sample integrations with orchestrator recipes, let me know!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_stats.py — Documentation
Objective
To compute, in a standardized and reusable way, basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) for all numeric columns in a time series dataset stored within the framework's shared in-memory context (ctx).
This scriptlet promotes composability and auditability by ensuring each step is atomic and logs its output in ctx.

Description
This scriptlet operates on a ctx entry corresponding to a key holding a list-of-lists (e.g., rows of time series data).

It interprets the specified ctx key as a 2D numeric array (e.g., readings over time).

Computes the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each column.

Results are stored in ctx under an output key (as a dict), enabling further steps to access or display statistics.

Dependencies
Python >= 3.6 (for type annotation compatibility across the codebase).

NumPy (numpy) for efficient array-based computation and statistical functions.

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
As a Recipe Step:
text
- name: compute_stats
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_stats
  function: run
  params:
    key: "sensor_readings"
    out: "sensor_stats"
This computes stats for the matrix stored as ctx["sensor_readings"] and puts the resulting stats dict in ctx["sensor_stats"].

Standalone CLI (direct function call):
python
import scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_stats as ctx_stats

ctx = {"data": [[1.2, 3.4], [2.5, 2.8], [0.8, 4.1]]}
ctx_stats.run(ctx, {"key": "data", "out": "data_stats"})
print(ctx["data_stats"])
# Output: {'mean': [...], 'std': [...], 'min': [...], 'max': [...]}
Within a Workflow:
After cleaning a dataset: You can run ctx_stats to profile data columns before further analytics or reporting.

For summary reporting: Pipe the output to a reporting scriptlet, or directly visualize the stats in apps like hello_dash.py.

Limitations
Input Format: Requires ctx[<key>] to be a list of lists, with each sub-list being a numeric row. Non-numeric values will trigger a NumPy exception.

No Per-Column Labeling: The output is a dict of lists corresponding to columns by position, not by name (no mapping to header row).

No Row Filtering: Assumes all rows are valid. Pre-filter with another scriptlet if necessary.

No Missing Value Handling: NaN or None inputs will propagate as NumPy defaults.

Batch Only: No support for incremental/stateless computation over streaming data.

Usage Examples
1. Basic Stat Computation
python
ctx = {"my_data": [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]}
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_stats
ctx_stats.run(ctx, {"key": "my_data", "out": "my_data_stats"})
print(ctx["my_data_stats"])
# {
#   'mean': [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
#   'std':  [2.449..., 2.449..., 2.449...],
#   'min':  [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
#   'max':  [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]
# }
2. Used in a Recipe with Downstream Analysis
text
steps:
  - name: init_ctx
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_init
    function: run
    params: {keys: ["measurements"]}
  - name: fill_ctx
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_row_updater
    function: run
    params: {key: "measurements", n: 3, interval_sec: 1}
    background: true
  - name: compute_stats

    module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_stats
    function: run
    params: {key: "measurements", out: "measurement_stats"}
    depends_on: [fill_ctx]
3. Visualizing Stats in Dash
After ctx_stats, supply ctx[<out>] to a dashboard:

python
from dash import dcc
means = ctx["my_data_stats"]["mean"]
dcc.Graph(figure=go.Figure(data=[go.Bar(y=means)]))
4. Error Handling Demo
If any entry in the matrix is not convertible to float, NumPy will raise:

python
ctx = {"data": [[1, "bad", 3], [4, 5, 6]]}
# ctx_stats.run(ctx, {"key": "data", ...}) # Raises ValueError or TypeError.
Recommendations (Tips & Suggestions for Expansion and Enhancement)
1. Support for Header Row / Column Names
Accept an optional headers param, or infer headers if the first row is a list of strings.

Return {"mean": {"colA": 1.0, ...}} instead of positional lists.

2. Missing Data/NaN Handling
Add options to ignore_nan: true or to impute missing values (mean, median, zero…).

Warn if non-numeric rows are detected.

3. Per-Column Selection and Filtering
Support columns or select param to restrict stats to a subset.

4. Additional Statistics
Include median, percentiles (e.g., 25th, 75th), sum, count.

Optionally, return histograms or quantiles for each column.

5. Output Formatting
Return as both column-wise dict and as a summary table for reporting.

Add pretty-print or Markdown/HTML output for dashboards.

6. Incremental/Streaming Mode
Provide a mode to update running statistics row-by-row for large or streaming datasets.

Use Welford’s algorithm or similar for numeric stability.

7. Type/Shape Validation
Validate input shape before computation; provide helpful errors if wrong type.

Log/append warning in ctx (following the framework's logging conventions).

8. Integration with Event and Trace Logging
Use the ctx logging utilities (ctx_logger, ctx_trace, etc.) for automatic audit trail.

9. Composability
Return serialized output compatible with other scriptlets (e.g., use with ctx_excel, dashboards, report generators).

Provide a recipe template for common data profiling flows.

10. Unit Testing
Ship tests for empty input, non-numeric input, missing keys, and very large data.

Use the built-in test harness as in tests/test_ctx_row_updater.py.

Summary
ctx_stats.py is a concise, core analytical building block for numeric profiling in the orchestrator framework.

It excels at atomic, reusable, summarized analytics directly from in-memory context data, strictly following framework best practices for auditability and traceability.

Focused expansion (column names, missing data handling, logging, expanded stats) will seamlessly integrate with the framework's philosophy of composability, atomicity, traceability, and testability.


---------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_row_updater.py — Documentation
Objective
Automate the generation of live, dynamically growing timeseries data

Continuously append rows (timestamp, random values) to a specific key in the shared orchestrator context (ctx), supporting live dashboards, streaming data, or synthetic test data scenarios.

Primarily designed for use as a background step within orchestrator recipes, but can be run as a standalone CLI script for demonstration, integration, or testing.

Description
ctx_row_updater.py is a Python scriptlet for the Orchestrator workspace, responsible for real-time, thread-based appending of data rows to a list at a specified ctx key. Each row consists of:

the current timestamp (ISO 8601 string),

followed by n random floating-point numbers in [0, 1).

This forms a classic timeseries structure, useful for feeding live dashboards (e.g., Dash apps), simulating data ingestion in testing, or demonstrating the ctx as a shared context for steps running in the same orchestrator process.

Runs as a daemon background thread to allow the orchestrator runner or Dash app to operate concurrently.

Output is always a list of lists:
[ [timestamp, rand1, rand2, ..., randn], ... ]
which is JSON-serializable and suitable for storage in the orchestrator shared context.

Scriptlet is small, atomic, and CLI-compatible, matching project standards for modularity and testability.

Dependencies & Requirements
Python >=3.6

Standard Library:

threading — for background operation

time, datetime — for real-time timestamping

random — for value simulation

argparse — for CLI argument parsing

Can be run as a module or imported — no external dependencies.

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
Automated Testing and Demonstrations
Populate ctx["new_row"] with timeseries data for Dash dashboards (e.g., live charts).

Use as a background job within orchestrator-driven pipelines for integration/acceptance testing.

Simulate sensor streams, device telemetry, or synthetic input for AI pipelines.

Typical Orchestrator Integration
In orchestrator recipes (YAML):

text
- name: update_ctx_background
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_row_updater
  function: run
  params:
    key: "new_row"
    n: 3            # number of random values per row
    interval_sec: 1 # interval (seconds) between rows
  background: true  # recommended: non-blocking
Suitable for use after ctx_init, which prepares the context key as an empty list:

text
- name: start_shared_ctx
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_init
  function: run
  params:
    keys: ["new_row"]
CLI Usage
Directly run from shell, for manual or debugging scenarios:

shell
python scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_row_updater.py --key my_live_data --n 5 --interval_sec 0.5
This will append every 0.5 seconds a row like [timestamp, rand1, rand2, rand3, rand4, rand5] to ctx["my_live_data"].

Script blocks indefinitely, as the background thread never ends (intended for integration with orchestrator or Dash apps).

Example: Complete Pipeline
Initialize the key:

shell
python scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_init.py --keys my_data
Start row updater (3 columns, every 2s):

shell
python scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_row_updater.py --key my_data --n 3 --interval_sec 2
Visualize live with Dash app (in an orchestrator recipe or manually):

shell
python scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py --port 8050 --ctx_key my_data
See points streaming live on your browser!

Example: In a Unit Test
python
import time
import scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_row_updater as ctx_row_updater

ctx = {"foo": []}
ctx_row_updater.run(ctx, {"key": "foo", "n": 2, "interval_sec": 0.1})
time.sleep(0.5)
assert len(ctx["foo"]) >= 2
Limitations
In-memory only:

Data in ctx is not persistent unless handled by the orchestrator runner (e.g., with snapshot, save operations).

Only supports numeric (random) value generation — not real sensor input or user-defined ranges/values.

No stop/termination mechanism — background thread runs indefinitely (rely on orchestrator runner process lifecycle).

Assumes ctx[key] is a list and is initialized before use (should pair with ctx_init).

Not suitable for enormous datasets in production — appends forever, so memory use will grow.

No error handling/reporting of thread failures — always runs as a daemon, possible exceptions are swallowed.

Detailed Examples
1. Default: 3 columns, 1s interval
shell
python scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_row_updater.py --key demo --n 3 --interval_sec 1
Resulting ctx["demo"] (after a few seconds):

python
[
  ["2025-08-26T03:10:54.581", 0.2312, 0.8937, 0.0034],
  ["2025-08-26T03:10:55.582", 0.8182, 0.2874, 0.9188],
  ...
]
2. Integration with Orchestrator runner (YAML step)
text
- idx: 2
  name: simulate_data
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_row_updater
  function: run
  params:
    key: "telemetry"
    n: 5
    interval_sec: 0.25
  background: true
3. Custom interval, more columns
shell
python scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_row_updater.py --key log --n 10 --interval_sec 0.05
4. Use in Dash app (live plotting):
Start both scripts:

shell
python scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_init.py --keys chart_values
# Then in another terminal
python scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_row_updater.py --key chart_values --n 4 --interval_sec 0.5
# Then
python scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py --port 8050 --ctx_key chart_values
Recommendations and Enhancement Suggestions (Framework-compliant)
Recommended Expansions
Support Custom Value Functions

Allow user to supply a callable (or built-in type string, e.g., "random", "gaussian", "sin", etc.) to generate values, for scientific test generation scenarios.

Graceful Stop/Signal Support

Accept a threading.Event or ctx flag to allow orchestrator or external command to signal the updater thread to halt.

Optionally, log reason to ctx (“stopped at user request”).

Data Retention/Window Control

Option to limit ctx[key] to a fixed maximum (rolling window):
e.g., only last_n rows are kept to bound memory use.

Multi-key or Batch Mode

Allow updating multiple ctx keys in parallel, each with its own pattern/interval.

More Robust Error Handling

Log issues to ctx["log"] or ctx["errors"] per framework traceability needs.

Catch/Report initialization errors (e.g., wrong type at ctx[key]).

Custom Value Range

Allow configuration of min/max or real-valued ranges for generated data instead of [0, 1).

Enable simulation of sensor limits or test case constraints.

Command-line enhancements

Print each row generated to stdout (optional/verbose mode).

Add --max-rows option for batch or finite-length demo/testing runs.

Type and Parameter Validation

Assert ctx[key] is a list and warn/raise if not, according to workspace standards for early error detection.

Rich Metadata

Optionally, allow rows to include extra metadata columns (e.g., step ID, test tag).

Integration Hooks

Emit events to ctx["events"] on new data points for Dash notification/toast demonstration.

General Best Practices (as per README & UserGuide)
Ensure only JSON-serializable objects enter ctx (no objects/functions).

Keep scriptlet atomic — never combine unrelated features (respect separation of concern).

Add detailed docstrings and usage at the top of the scriptlet.

Maintain CLI-compatibility — every enhancement should not break standalone or recipe-driven use.

Enable optional debug/log verbosity parameter for in-depth developer insight.

Conclusion
ctx_row_updater.py is a model Orchestrator scriptlet: composable, testable, and flexible for real-time data demo needs, with room for extension into more advanced use cases like batch simulation, protocol testing, or IoT/sensor emulation. All enhancements should respect the "one-responsibility-per-scriptlet" and extensively-documented style.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_init.py — Orchestrator Scriptlet Documentation
Objective
Primary Goal:
To initialize one or more keys in the shared in-memory orchestrator context (ctx), setting each as an empty list.

Why:
Ensures all downstream orchestrator steps and scriptlets can safely interact with these ctx keys (read/write/append/consume) without encountering missing-key errors or uninitialized variable bugs.

Broader Purpose:
Provides a standardized way for orchestration recipes and stand-alone scriptlets to establish context structure upfront, enabling robust, modular, and reusable pipeline components.

Description
ctx_init.py is a small, atomic Python scriptlet found in scriptlets/python/steps/.

It follows the Orchestrator standards:

Fully independent: can be run from the CLI or as part of a recipe.

Contains detailed usage documentation and explicit limitations.

Only stores JSON-serializable types in ctx (enforced by the Context class).

All ctx mutations are traceable when run under debug mode.

How it works:

Accepts a list of keys to create in ctx.

For each provided key:

Adds key to the shared ctx if not present, set to [].

If key is already present, overwrites the previous value (idempotent for again-initializing as list).

Guarantees a consistent starting structure for shared context, reducing risk of downstream logic errors.

Designed for orchestration:
Works for both file-based and in-memory pipelines, and is usable by downstream scriptlets (Python or shell) via the standardized ctx sharing.

Dependencies & Requirements
Python Version: 3.6+

Standard Libraries: Only uses argparse for CLI argument parsing

External files: None

Orchestrator Integration:

Fully compatible with the Orchestrator runner (runner.py) and context system (context.py).

No internal state or external dependencies beyond ctx and the orchestrator runtime.

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
A) As a Recipe Step (YAML)
Usage in an Orchestrator recipe to ensure ctx keys are present before data population:

text
- name: start_shared_ctx
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_init
  function: run
  params:
    keys: ["log_rows", "metrics", "errors"]
Outcome: Initializes ctx["log_rows"] = [], ctx["metrics"] = [], etc.

B) CLI Command (for debug/development)
Initialization outside workflow for quick testing:

text
python scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_init.py --keys foo bar
Result: ctx with foo and bar keys, each mapped to an empty list.

C) Shell Integration
Often combined with expose_for_shell to set environment vars for shell scriptlets:

python
from context import Context, expose_for_shell
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_init

ctx = Context()
ctx_init.run(ctx, {"keys": ["data_rows", "stats"]})
env = expose_for_shell(ctx, ["data_rows"])
# 'env' can now be used to pass to a shell subprocess
D) Unit Testing (as per provided test file)
python
def test_ctx_init_run():
    ctx = {}
    result = ctx_init.run(ctx, {"keys": ["foo", "bar"]})
    assert "foo" in ctx and "bar" in ctx
    assert ctx["foo"] == []
    assert result["initialized"] == ["foo", "bar"]
Demonstrates how testing is trivial and robust.

Limitations
Key names:

Limited to valid Python identifiers; invalid key names may lead to downstream issues or errors.

Value:

Only initializes each key to an empty list. No support for other default types (dict, int, etc).

Overwrites previous value for each key, regardless of type.

No schema enforcement:

Does not check type or structure of keys after initialization—strictly a set-to-empty-list step.

No persistence:

Keys only exist in the in-memory ctx unless serialized elsewhere by pipeline logic.

No multi-level/recursive initialization:

Flat key list only, no support for nested dict structures or complex schemas.

Detailed Usage Examples
1. Recipe for log-then-update
text
steps:
  - idx: 1
    name: init_data_keys
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_init
    function: run
    params:
      keys: ["raw_rows", "processed_rows"]

  - idx: 2
    name: fetch_data
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.steps.fetch_data
    function: run
    params:
      key: "raw_rows"
    depends_on: ["init_data_keys"]
2. Shell Scriptlet Integration
text
python scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_init.py --keys data1 data2
Check the result in a shell by printing the environment:

text
python -c "import orchestrator.context as ctx; ctx = ctx.Context(); from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_init; ctx_init.run(ctx, {'keys':['foo']}); print(ctx)"
3. In a larger Python sequence
python
from context import Context
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_init

ctx = Context()
ctx_init.run(ctx, {"keys": ["step_events"]})
ctx["step_events"].append({"status": "started"})
4. Integration with Dash App Step
text
- idx: 1
  name: initialize_time_series
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_init
  function: run
  params:
    keys: ["time_series"]

- idx: 2
  name: monitor_dashboard
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.apps.hello_dash
  function: run
  params:
    port: 8050
    ctx_key: "time_series"
  depends_on: ["initialize_time_series"]
Recommendations & Expansion Suggestions
A. Parameterization
Add support for more initial value types:

params: {keys: {"foo": [], "bar": {}}}

Optional default value per key.

B. Schema Validation
Allow type/schema hints for initialization, warning if overwritten or type mismatch.

Use a new schema param:

python
{"keys": ["a"], "schema": {"a": {"type": list}}}
C. Multi-level/Nested Keys
Support initializing nested keys, e.g., foo.bar.baz

Can use dot notation or nested dict in params.

D. Safety/Idempotency
Option to raise warning or error if trying to re-initialize an existing non-list key.

E. Bulk Operations
Allow keys to be initialized as dict, int, etc:

python
ctx_init.run(ctx, {"init": {"foo": [], "bar": {}, "counter": 0}})
F. Logging/Auditing
Log every initialization (key, timestamp, caller) to ctx["init_log"] for enhanced traceability.

G. Type Annotation for Downstream Steps
Optionally store a ctx["types"] mapping for downstream type checks and auto-validation.

H. CLI Expansion
Support listing all current keys and their types/values from the command line (--list).

Allow initializing from a file describing the initialization schema.

I. Compatibility & Minimalism
All backwards compatibility must be preserved.

New features must be optional and controlled by parameters.

Example Expanded API (for future):
python
def run(ctx, params):
    """
    params: {
        "keys": ["foo", "bar"],                    # legacy API, keeps feature
        "init": {"foo": [], "bar": {}, "baz": 1},  # extended: default values
        "schema": {"foo": {"type": list}, ...},    # optional schema
        "fail_on_exists": False,                   # enhanced safety
        ...
    }
    """
Final Tips
Use ctx_init.py as the first step of any recipe that requires new context keys shared across parallel or dependent steps.

Keep key naming conventions clear and consistent with downstream applications and scriptlets.

Adopt or expand parameterization only if needed—minimalism and composability are key to robust automation.

Update docstring and usage docs with any enhancement, and always provide direct, tested YAML and CLI examples.

In summary:
ctx_init.py is a foundational utility for robust and reproducible automation with the orchestrator framework. Following the best practices outlined above will allow you to expand its usage and features as your pipelines grow in complexity, without sacrificing modularity or traceability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scriptlets/python/steps/ctx_event_bus.py
Objective
Provide a simple, JSON-serializable pub/sub event bus within the orchestrator's shared in-memory context (ctx). Enables clear event emission and tracking between steps, Python scriptlets, shell scriptlets, and dashboards (e.g., Dash via ctx).

Description
ctx_event_bus.py appends event dictionaries to ctx["events"] with a precise timestamp and an optional source identifier.

The event store is readily retrievable and serializable for live dashboards, auditing, or downstream scripts.

Intended to enable notifications, triggers, or state transitions that other steps, dashboards, or shell integrations can discover or react to.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+ (no third-party packages required)

Standard library: time

Applications and Integrations
Inter-step triggers:
Steps push events (e.g., "result_ready", "threshold_exceeded"), allowing other steps or dashboards to identify and respond to new workflow events.

Dashboards:
Dash (or other UIs) poll ctx["events"] for new entries; can display toast notifications, alerts, or update graphs in response.

Shell/External:
Events tracked in ctx can be exported (via the orchestrator) to shell scriptlets or external systems, e.g., Slack notifications via a subsequent scriptlet.

Auditing:
All events are stored, providing a full historical trail via ctx and, if persisted, in step logs or reports.

Limitations
In-memory only: Events persist only for the workflow run unless explicitly saved or archived.

No filtering/removal: No event expiration, pruning, or filtering—old events accumulate unless manually cleared.

No native subscriber callbacks: Unlike distributed brokers (Redis, RabbitMQ), polling/response is manual (e.g., Dash callback polling or workflow step checking).

No delivery guarantees: Purely append-only; downstream actors must regularly check for new events.

Not suitable for high-frequency or high-volume messaging: Only supports orchestration-level eventing, not "stream" data.

Usage
Single Event Push

python
from scriptlets.python.steps import ctx_event_bus

# Python: push an event
ctx = {}
ctx_event_bus.run(ctx, {"event": "test_completed", "source": "step_results", "payload": {"result": "pass"}})
# ctx["events"] contains:
# [
#    {'timestamp': '2025-08-26 01:40:00',
#     'event': 'test_completed',
#     'source': 'step_results',
#     'payload': {'result': 'pass'}}
# ]
Multiple Events in a Pipeline

python
# Step 1 (in recipe):
- idx: 2
  name: emit_data_ready
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_event_bus
  function: run
  params:
    event: "data_ready"
    source: "preprocess"
    payload: { filename: "data/clean.csv" }

# Step 2:
- idx: 3
  name: emit_anomaly
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_event_bus
  function: run
  params:
    event: "anomaly_detected"
    source: "analyze"
    payload: { row: 15, col: "temp", value: 97.2 }
Dash UI Integration (Polling Events for Alerts)

python
# In a Dash callback (Python):
events = ctx.get("events", [])
recent = [e for e in events if e["event"] == "anomaly_detected"]
if recent:
    show_alert("Warning! Anomaly detected.")
Auditing & Workflow Reporting

python
# At the end of a run, events can be summarized:
for entry in ctx.get("events", []):
    print(f"{entry['timestamp']} - [{entry['source']}]: {entry['event']} {entry['payload']}")
Manual Event Clearing (when needed)

python
# After processing, clear events if you wish:
ctx["events"] = []
API/Function Signature
python
def run(ctx, params):
    """
    Appends a new event dict to ctx["events"] with:
        - timestamp: str
        - event: str (event type)
        - source: str (step or module name, optional)
        - payload: dict (any JSON-serializable payload, optional)

    source: "metric_eval"
    payload:
      metric: "temperature"
      value: 101.5
      threshold: 100
Recommendation & Tips for Enhancement
1. Event Filtering and Query API
Add helper scriptlets for querying/filtering events by event type, source, or time range, e.g.:

python
def get_events(ctx, event_type=None, since=None):
    # Filter ctx["events"] using event_type/ since timestamp
    pass
2. Automatic Event Expiration or Rotation
Support optional max length or TTL on ctx["events"] to avoid unbounded memory growth:

python
MAX_EVENTS = 1000
if len(ctx["events"]) > MAX_EVENTS:
    ctx["events"] = ctx["events"][-MAX_EVENTS:]
3. Event Subscription Helpers
Write supporting utilities to help polling actors (steps, dashboards) "subscribe" to events by registering interest (e.g., via ctx keys).
4. External Event Integrations
Integrate with distributed brokers as an option, i.e., if a config flag is set, forward events to Redis/SQS/MQTT to support multi-process or multi-host eventing, using patterns from ctx_event_bus_advanced.py.
5. Enhanced Payload Validation
Optionally validate payload structure, ensuring only JSON-serializable objects and key field presence.
6. Auditable Event History
Persist events automatically to a log file or to the Logs directory for later review/audit.
7. Backward Compatibility
Continue to maintain dictionary-based interface; always provide sensible defaults for missing fields.
8. Event Metrics
Optionally provide built-in metrics, such as the number of events per type, sources encountered, most recent event, etc.
9. Documentation & Discoverability
Auto-generate API docs for ctx_event_bus.py and all event types recorded in a run, making it easier for users to discover possible events and usage in UIs and recipes.

Sample Advanced Feature — Event Callback (Python)
For advanced usage, allow user-defined callback hooks (in orchestrator or dashboard), e.g.:

python
# Pseudocode: after an event is added, call any registered handler/CB
def run(ctx, params):
    # ... as above ...
    if hasattr(ctx, "_event_callback"):
        ctx._event_callback(event)

ctx_diff_report.py – Documentation
Objective
ctx_diff_report.py is dedicated to comparing two keys in the shared ctx (context) object—typically storing lists or datasets before and after a processing step—and producing a human-readable difference ("diff") report. The main purpose is to enable traceable, auditable, and reproducible data workflows: after data transformations, cleaning, analysis, or enrichment, you can see exactly what changed line-by-line.

Key goals:

Spot and record all changes for audit, debugging, and reporting.

Enable downstream reporting, visualization, and troubleshooting, especially in multi-step pipelines.

Description
This scriptlet:

Takes two ctx keys (e.g., before_transformation, after_transformation).

Interprets their contents as sequences (usually lists of rows or dicts).

Produces a detailed unified diff (like diff -u in Unix), showing additions, deletions, and modifications.

Stores the diff both in the ctx dictionary (key specified by out) and writes it as a Markdown/plain-text file at the path specified by file.

Workflow:

Read both contexts and serialize each row as a string (for diffing robustness).

Use difflib.unified_diff to generate a diff between the two serialized datasets.

Store the result in ctx and write it to disk.

Dependencies
Python (≥3.6)

Standard library modules only:

difflib (for generating unified diffs)

The orchestrator’s ctx must be present (i.e., script executed under orchestrator context).

Application & Integration
Key integration points:

Post-data processing: Track exactly what changed as a result of a cleaning, normalization, feature engineering, or analysis step.

QA: Verify that an operation didn’t introduce unexpected changes.

Auditing: Keep a persistent record of what a transformation pipeline actually modified.

Debugging: Quickly spot unintended side effects after running a recipe.

How it’s typically called in a recipe:

text
- name: diff_before_after
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_diff_report
  function: run
  params:
    key1: before
    key2: after
    out: diff_report
    file: Data/diff_report.md
This will:

Compare ctx["before"] and ctx["after"]

Store the textual diff in ctx["diff_report"]

Write the diff to Data/diff_report.md

Limitations
Shallow Diff: Diff is generated line-by-line after stringifying the rows. It cannot do deep diffs on nested structures (like dicts of lists). Only "surface" (row-level) changes are detected.

Order Sensitivity: Changes in row ordering will be shown as deletions and insertions, even if the actual row data moved.

Data Types: Best suited to lists of lists or lists of dicts. More complex or nested structures may produce diffs that are hard to interpret.

Schema: Assumes both keys contain similar row structures (same number of columns or dict keys). Mismatched schemas produce noisy/uninformative diffs.

Performance: For very large datasets, diffing in-memory may stress system resources and produce very large Markdown files.

Usage Examples
1. Compare CSV or table-like datasets
Pre & post data cleaning:

python
# ctx["raw_data"] and ctx["clean_data"] are both lists of lists
run(ctx, {
    "key1": "raw_data",
    "key2": "clean_data",
    "out": "clean_diff",
    "file": "Data/clean_diff.md"
})
# ctx["clean_diff"] now contains the diff, and Data/clean_diff.md is the saved report.
2. Compare list of dicts (records) after normalization
python
run(ctx, {
    "key1": "records_before",
    "key2": "records_after",
    "out": "records_diff",
    "file": "Data/records_diff.md"
})
You can open the .md file in any Markdown viewer or directly inspect ctx["records_diff"] (as a list of diff lines).

3. Integration into a workflow for regression testing
As part of a recipe:

text
- idx: 8
  name: diff_step
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_diff_report
  function: run
  params:
    key1: "dataset_yesterday"
    key2: "dataset_today"
    out: "day_vs_day_diff"
    file: Data/day_vs_day_diff.md
4. Programmatic inspection inside a Dash app or unit test
python
result = ctx_diff_report.run(ctx, {
    "key1": "before",
    "key2": "after",
    "out": "diff",
    "file": "Data/mydiff.md"
})
print(ctx["diff"])
5. Comparing manually edited Excel exports and automated outputs
Export to Excel (using ctx_excel.py).

Import both old and new as lists.

Diff to confirm only intended values changed.

Practical Output Example
Suppose:

python
ctx["before"] = [
    [1, "foo", 10],
    [2, "bar", 11],
    [3, "baz", 13],
]
ctx["after"] = [
    [1, "foo", 10],
    [2, "bar", 12],
    [4, "zzz", 44],
]
Running diff will generate (in ctx["diff_report"] or the specified file):

text
--- before
+++ after
@@ ... @@
 [2, 'bar', 11]
-[3, 'baz', 13]
+[2, 'bar', 12]
+[4, 'zzz', 44]
This shows clearly: the second row was updated; a new row was added; another deleted.

Recommendations (Expanding Capability & Features)
General Tips
Always validate input data types and lengths before computing diffs.

When reporting for audit or QA, integrate the Markdown diff file output into CI or reporting checks.

Feature Expansion Suggestions (Framework-compliant & Backward Compatible)
Semantic Diff Enhancement

Instead of comparing stringified rows, support "column-aware" diffs for lists of dicts (show which fields/columns changed).

Optionally add a diff_mode parameter: "row", "cell", "column".

Summary Statistics

Add a summary section above the diff listing:

Rows Added: X

Rows Removed: Y

Rows Changed: Z (with changed columns listed)

Store summary in a ctx key (e.g. "diff_summary") for downstream checks.

Visual/HTML Output

Add support for outputting HTML diffs for direct embedding in Dash UIs or dashboards.

Optionally write both .md and .html files.

Integration with Automation Reports

Build hooks to embed the diff report inside final PDF/Word reports via the reporting scriptlets.

Pagination or Filtering

For large datasets, paginate diffs or filter by keywords/columns.

Schema Change Detection

Add a pre-diff step that explicitly checks and reports schema mismatches (different columns, missing fields).

Row Matching by Key/ID

If both datasets have a unique ID field, compare by ID, not row order. This makes diffs robust to sorting/ordering and highlights only actual changes.

CLI Enhancements

Add CLI options for usage outside orchestrator context (input via file path, optional output targets).

Deep/Nested Dict Diff

For dict-of-dicts, perform and report nested diffs (perhaps using external libraries like deepdiff).

Slack/Email Notification of Major Diffs

If a big difference is detected, trigger a notification using the notification scriptlets for real-time alerts.

Coding Practice/Compliance
Always keep all additional features "opt-in" (default usage remains unchanged).

Any refactor should preserve the core CLI/function API for backward compatibility with existing recipes.

Add detailed docstrings and examples, as standardized by the workspace (“each scriptlet must have a detailed docstring with usage, description, limitations”).

Write unit tests for all new modes and options (see tests/ for format).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation: scriptlets/python/core/recipe_merge.py
Objective
Provide a utility to merge multiple orchestrator recipe YAML files (or specific steps within them) into one unified recipe, thereby enabling reuse, modularity, and the ability to compose large or complex orchestrations from smaller, independently tested units.

Description
What does it do?
recipe_merge.py loads the YAML content of two or more recipe files and merges their steps (either all steps, or only specific steps if provided) into a new output file.

The resulting merged recipe is itself a valid orchestration recipe, ready for execution by the runner.py orchestrator, thus supporting workflow composition, modularization, and sharing.

High-level flow:
Input: List of recipe file paths, optionally a list of step names to include, and the output file path for the merged recipe.

Process: Loads, parses and merges steps from the listed recipe files.

Output: A single new YAML recipe file containing the union (or subset) of steps from the inputs, written to the path specified.

How it works:
Loads each recipe using yaml.safe_load.

Collects steps. If a steps filter is provided, only those step names are included.

All included steps are combined into a single "steps" list.

Writes the merged steps into the output YAML file with the standard workspace structure.

Dependencies
Python packages:

yaml (pyyaml): For reading and writing YAML files.

Workspace structure:

Expects recipes to follow the workspace’s canonical format—test_meta, steps list, etc.

File system:

Recipe files must exist at specified paths, and the output file must be writable.

Applications / Integrations / Usage Scenarios
Workflow Composition:
Build complex pipelines by merging smaller, tested, team-specific recipes into an overall project recipe.

Reuse and Modularity:
Enable sharing of common "step blocks" (e.g., data cleaning, reporting, dashboarding) across teams.

Template Expansion:
Quickly assemble demo or project recipes from a bank of pre-built step sequences.

Limitations
No Deduplication:
Steps with the same name across files are included as-written; if names conflict, later ones silently override earlier ones within the output YAML (the runner will treat only names as unique).

Shallow Merge:
Only merges at the steps level. Other top-level properties (e.g., test_meta) are not merged/preserved unless done manually.

No Validation:
Does not check for step dependencies, idx collisions, or recipe-level consistency after merge.

Does not merge non-step YAML sections:
Only the merged steps are included; user must add/update a test_meta or other blocks for the output recipe as needed.

No CLI:
Intended to be called as a scriptlet within orchestrator or imported in a recipe step, not as a direct command-line utility.

Usage Examples
Merging all steps from two recipes
In a Python/scriptlet context:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import recipe_merge

ctx = {}
params = {
    "recipes": ["recipes/a.yaml", "recipes/b.yaml"],
    "out": "recipes/ab_merged.yaml"
}
recipe_merge.run(ctx, params)
Result:

All steps from a.yaml and b.yaml are written in order to ab_merged.yaml.

Merging only selected steps from multiple recipes
python
from scriptlets.python.core import recipe_merge

ctx = {}
params = {
    "recipes": ["recipes/data_cleaning.yaml", "recipes/reporting.yaml"],
    "steps": ["preprocess_csv", "generate_report"],
    "out": "recipes/specialized.yaml"
}
recipe_merge.run(ctx, params)
Result:

Only the steps named "preprocess_csv" and "generate_report" (across all listed files) are merged.

Using in an orchestrator recipe as a step
text
- idx: 1
  name: merge_core_blocks
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.recipe_merge
  function: run
  params:
    recipes: ["recipes/clean.yaml", "recipes/feature.yaml"]
    out: "recipes/combined.yaml"
Integration Example in a Recipe
Suppose you want to build a master recipe by merging steps from multiple department recipes:

text
steps:
  - idx: 1
    name: merge_team_recipes
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.core.recipe_merge
    function: run
    params:
      recipes: ["recipes/team1.yaml", "recipes/team2.yaml"]
      out: "recipes/merged_enterprise.yaml"
  - idx: 2
    name: run_merged_recipe
    type: shell
    cmd: python
    args:
      - runner.py
      - --recipe
      - recipes/merged_enterprise.yaml
Examples of Final Output
Merged recipe will look like:

text
steps:
  - idx: 1
    name: preprocess_csv
    ...
  - idx: 2
    name: clean_data
    ...
  - idx: 3
    name: generate_report
    ...
  # All merged steps from both sources in order
You should update/add the top-level test_meta block as needed for your final merged recipe.

Recommendations and Enhancement Tips
1. Validation and Collisions
Add validation for conflicting step name or idx values, issuing warnings or errors.

Optionally provide a rename_conflicts or deduplicate flag.

2. Metadata Merge
Enable merging of test_meta blocks or provide a method to bundle all top-level metadata, not just steps.

3. Custom Ordering
Support a parameter like order_by: idx | name | custom to control merged step ordering (useful if indices may overlap).

4. YAML Comments Preservation
Optionally use a YAML library that preserves comments if recipe files are heavily commented and those should persist.

5. Command-Line Interface
Add a main block so the scriptlet is executable directly as a CLI tool for ad hoc external merges and quick experiments:

bash
python scriptlets/python/core/recipe_merge.py --recipes a.yaml b.yaml --out merged.yaml
6. Step Filtering Logic
Allow advanced filters: by step type (e.g., only Python steps), or regex patterns for step names.

7. Verbose/Debug Output
Add a verbosity option to log which steps are merged, skipped, or produce warning.

8. Integration with Step Registry
For discoverability, integrate recipe merging into a larger recipe registry system, allowing users to select merge targets from available registered components.

9. Automated Index Rewriting
Relabel or re-index steps on merge so the resulting recipe maintains a strictly increasing and non-colliding idx for execution order clarity.

10. Unit and Integration Tests
Provide a tests/ folder test for this scriptlet, asserting that merges work as intended (you can follow the testing style used in your workspace).

11. Documentation and Discoverability
Add a function to output a summary of all available steps in a set of recipes, aiding discoverability for what is "mergable."

Document the merged output YAML for context/history on how/why the merge was performed.

Summary
recipe_merge.py is a core utility for modular, scalable orchestrated automation. It empowers teams to build up, decompose, and share workflow logic as “step blocks” while maintaining clear provenance and easy debugging.
Expanding its functionality—especially with validation, user-friendly CLI, metadata integration, and flexible step ordering—will further boost its power and usability in a growing automation ecosystem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
file_to_ctx.py — Detailed Documentation
Objective
Purpose:
Provide a reusable, atomic utility to load structured data from external files (currently JSON or CSV) into the shared orchestrator context (ctx) under a user-defined key.

Goal:
Enable easy population or restoration of in-memory shared data for any orchestrator pipeline step, resumption, or shell/Python integration—while enforcing JSON-compatible data structure for further processing, analysis, or reporting.

Description
Functionality:
This scriptlet reads a file (JSON or CSV) from disk and places its parsed content into the orchestrator’s in-memory context, under a user-specified key.

If format is "json":

Loads the file as a Python object using json.load.

Stores result as-is (usually list/dict, must be JSON-serializable).

If format is "csv":

Loads the file using Python’s csv.reader.

Stores the result as a list of lists (each row is a list of column values).

If the format is invalid, raises a ValueError.

Motivation:
Often, orchestrator workflows need to seed their context with fixture data, resume from snapshots, bring in preprocessed data, or bridge with external scripts that produce files. This scriptlet is a single point of entry for all such needs.

CLI/Programmatic:
Can be called as a CLI script or programmatically by the orchestrator/runner.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library:

json — for loading JSON files.

csv — for reading CSV files.

No external dependencies required for this scriptlet itself.

Environment: Python 3.6+ (inherits orchestrator's baseline).

Applications & Integrations
Recipe Integration:
Use as a step in recipes to load initial data for a workflow, restore from checkpoint, or initialize data for testing.

Error Recovery & Resume:
Supports restoring context (ctx) from a file snapshot after a failure, aiding robust workflows and debugging.

Shell to ctx Bridge:
External shell scripts/tools that can output JSON or CSV become easily ingestible.

Hybrid Pipelines:
Serves as a bridge step for hybrid pipelines where prior/next steps are not orchestrator-managed.

External Data Imports:
Brings in exported or 3rd-party structured data for analysis and reporting with minimal effort.

Examples of Use in a Recipe
text
- name: load_fixture_json
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.file_to_ctx
  function: run
  params:
    path: Data/fixture.json
    key: input_data
    format: json

- name: load_intermediate_csv
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.file_to_ctx
  function: run
  params:
    path: Data/data_cleaned.csv
    key: cleaned_rows
    format: csv
Standalone (CLI) Example
bash
python scriptlets/python/core/file_to_ctx.py --path Data/snapshot.json --key restore_key --format json
# (If you have code at the bottom to support CLI execution)
Programmatic Use
python
from scriptlets.python.core import file_to_ctx
ctx = {}
file_to_ctx.run(ctx, {"path": "Data/rows.csv", "key": "rows", "format": "csv"})
print(ctx["rows"])
Limitations
Supported Formats:
Only "json" and "csv" files are supported; others will raise a ValueError.

No Automatic Type Conversion:
For CSVs, all values are loaded as strings (csv.reader behavior). Post-processing for type conversion is up to later steps.

No Data Shape Enforcement:
No guarantees about keys/columns; relies on valid and compatible file content.

No File Existence/Error Handling:
If the file path is invalid or file is not found, it will raise a native Python exception.

No Output File Creation:
This scriptlet is strictly for input, not output (see ctx_to_file.py for dumping ctx to file).

JSON Serializability Enforced Downstream:
The loaded data must be JSON serializable for full pipeline compatibility, but this is not explicitly checked here (except as per Python's json module).

Usage Examples
Recipe Step: Loading a JSON File
text
- name: import_test_data
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.file_to_ctx
  function: run
  params:
    path: Data/test_input.json
    key: raw_data
    format: json
Recipe Step: Loading a CSV File
text
- name: import_raw_csv
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.file_to_ctx
  function: run
  params:
    path: Data/sensor_logs.csv
    key: sensor_logs
    format: csv
Now subsequent steps can use ctx["sensor_logs"] for further processing or analysis.

Resume from Snapshot Example
text
- name: restore_ctx_from_snapshot
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.file_to_ctx
  function: run
  params:
    path: Data/ctx_snapshot_20250825.json
    key: previous_ctx
    format: json
Followed by a step that could ctx.update(ctx["previous_ctx"]) for a full restore.

Debugging via Custom File Loads
Manually inject state:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import file_to_ctx
ctx = {}
file_to_ctx.run(ctx, {"path": "Data/debug_rows.csv", "key": "rows", "format": "csv"})
print(ctx["rows"])
Recommendation: Expanding and Enhancing file_to_ctx.py
To further align with your framework’s excellence and composability goals, consider these enhancements:

1. Format Auto-Detection
Allow format to be optional and guess based on file extension (.json, .csv, .xlsx, etc.).

If format is omitted, use the extension.

2. More Format Support
Add Excel (.xlsx) reading using openpyxl or pandas, with first row as header or indexable columns.

Support for TSV (.tsv) with a delimiter param.

Optional YAML support via pyyaml.

3. Column/Header Mapping for CSV/Excel
Allow mapping column names to custom keys, or reading CSV with header row and loading as list of dicts.

4. Enhanced Error Handling
Add explicit error messages for unsupported formats, missing files, malformed data.

Consider logging errors to ctx["errors"], as seen in other scriptlets.

5. Data Validation (Optional)
Accept a schema param to validate data shape after loading (see ctx_validate_schema.py).

6. Snapshot Merge
Add an option to merge loaded data with existing ctx, protecting/overriding only specified keys (useful for partial restores).

7. CLI Extension
Add CLI support (with argparse) so users can independently run from shell (for debug/prototyping).

Emit useful info on what was loaded.

8. Type Conversion/Casting Hooks
Allow specifying expected types per column for CSV (e.g., parse numeric columns, timestamps).

9. Logging Hooks
Log actions and errors to Logs/ctx_debug.log or via a standard context logger (like ctx_logger.py).

10. Security/Escaping
Ensure path is validated/escaped to avoid path traversal or workspace escape (as in some other file utilities).

Example: Enhanced YAML Specification
text
- name: import_xlsx_and_validate
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.file_to_ctx
  function: run
  params:
    path: Data/data.xlsx
    key: excel_data
    format: xlsx
    sheet: Sheet1
    use_header: true
    schema:
      col1: float
      col2: int
Summary Table
Field	Description	Example
path	File path to load	Data/mydata.csv
key	ctx key for loaded data	input_data
format	File format: json, csv (xlsx, yaml, tsv, ... with enhancements)	csv
delimiter	(optional) delimiter for CSV/TSV	"," or "\t"
use_header	(optional) treat first row as headers and produce list of dicts	true
schema	(optional) Python dict for validation	{"id": int, "value": float}
sheet	(optional) Excel sheet name for xlsx	Sheet1
Conclusion
file_to_ctx.py is a vital, reusable building block for input handling in your orchestrator, supporting modular, testable, and adaptive data workflows. With the recommendations above, it can become a universal, schema-safe data ingestion utility, bridging orchestrator automation with the outside world via a single function—without breaking your core philosophy of atomic, composable, and independently testable scriptlets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for ctx_workflow_viz.py
Objective
ctx_workflow_viz.py is designed to automatically generate a graphical workflow (Directed Acyclic Graph, or DAG) from a given orchestrator recipe YAML file. The resulting visualization makes it easy to understand the sequence and dependencies of steps in automation workflows and helps debug or present pipeline logic.

Description
Purpose:
Visualize the structure of orchestrator recipes (pipelines) using nodes (steps) and edges (dependencies) in a workflow graph.

How it Works:

Parses a YAML recipe file, extracting the ordered list of steps.

Constructs a directed graph (DAG) using Graphviz, where each step is a node.

Draws edges according to the step order (and, ideally, dependencies).

Renders and saves the visualization in image format (e.g., PNG, SVG) for human inspection or inclusion in reports.

Current Design:

Simple DAG: Only sequential order is visualized by default. Each step points to the next.

Modular: Called as a Python module or step in a recipe. Usable for CLI invocation or programmatic integration.

Dependencies
Python Environment: 3.6+

Required Libraries:

pyyaml — For parsing recipe YAML files.

graphviz — For creating and rendering the graphical workflow.

Note: Requires graphviz OS package installed (apt install graphviz or similar), not just the Python library.

Application and Integration
Typical Use Cases:

Display the execution plan for onboarding, review, or debugging.

Include workflow visuals in generated reports (docx, markdown, dashboards).

Quickly spot order or logic errors, missing dependencies, or potential bottlenecks before running pipelines.

How to Integrate:

Within Recipe:
You may add a step in any orchestrator YAML as follows:

text
- idx: N
  name: visualize_workflow
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_workflow_viz
  function: run
  params:
    recipe: "recipes/my_recipe.yaml"
    out: "Assets/graph.png"
This will auto-generate the workflow image after prior steps.

Standalone/CLI:
You can run the module directly from a Python shell or script:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_workflow_viz
result = ctx_workflow_viz.run({}, {"recipe": "recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml", "out": "Assets/graph.png"})
print(result)
Limitations
Dependency Visualization:
Currently, it links steps only by order, not by explicit depends_on relationships. True DAG logic for dependencies is not yet implemented.

Step Metadata:
Only step names are shown; critical metadata (type, status, etc.) are not visualized by default.

Scaling:
For very large workflows, graphs can become crowded without filtering/grouping.

File Output:
Only supports image formats recognized by Graphviz (e.g., PNG, SVG).

Error Checking:
Assumes valid recipe structure and unique step names. Poor error reporting on malformed recipes.

Usage Examples
1. Minimal Example (script call)

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_workflow_viz
ctx_workflow_viz.run({}, {"recipe": "recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml", "out": "Assets/my_workflow.png"})
This saves the graph to Assets/my_workflow.png.

2. As a Recipe Step

text
# This step auto-generates the workflow visualization after prior steps.
- idx: 99
  name: render_workflow_graph
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_workflow_viz
  function: run
  params:
    recipe: "recipes/custom_pipeline.yaml"
    out: "Assets/pipeline_graph.png"
3. CLI-analog (manual Python execution)

python
import sys
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_workflow_viz

if __name__ == "__main__":
    recipe_file = sys.argv[1]          # e.g., 'recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml'
    out_file = sys.argv[2]             # e.g., 'Assets/graph.png'
    ctx_workflow_viz.run({}, {"recipe": recipe_file, "out": out_file})
Then run:

shell
python your_script.py recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml Assets/graph.png
4. Integration with Reporting

After generating Assets/graph.png, you might embed it in a Word/Markdown report using the reporting utilities (e.g., in ctx_report_template.py).

5. Example Output

Suppose your recipe has steps:

preprocess → clean → analyze → report

The graph will chain these as nodes:

text
preprocess → clean → analyze → report
Recommendations & Expansion Tips
To fully align with and enhance the orchestrator framework’s philosophy and needs:

Feature Enhancements
Visualize True Dependencies
Parse and display depends_on relations as DAG edges.

Instead of only connecting in idx order, add edges from each step to all that depend on it.

Add Node Metadata

Display step type (python/shell/dash) as node color/shape.

Optionally show function/cmd name, status, or parameters.

Status-aware Visuals

Accept a step_status dict (color code: green=success, red=fail, orange=running, white=pending; see comments in runner.py and UserGuide.md).

Multiple Output Formats

Support PNG, SVG, and optionally interactive HTML.

Automated Embedding

Provide helper to auto-embed the image in generated docx/markdown/HTML reports.

Error Handling & Validation

Report missing/duplicate step names, circular dependencies, and bad recipes with clear error messages.

Support for Grouping/Filtering

Allow users to filter steps to visualize or group by type/functionality.

Dashboard Visualization Support

Expose a function for Dash/Flask apps to give live workflow status and current progress dynamically.

Legend and Readability

Add a legend for node types and edge meanings.

Automatically adjust layout for very large DAGs.

Recommended Code Pattern for Dependency Visualization
python
# Notional pseudocode for enhanced edge logic
for step in steps:
    name = step["name"]
    # Draw edges from all dependencies to this node
    for dep in step.get("depends_on", []):
        dot.edge(dep, name)
Best Practice Tips
Call the visualizer after any update to recipes so that users always see up-to-date DAGs.

Embed step audit data as node tooltips or labels for advanced reporting.

Document all arguments, expected keys, and outputs in code-level docstrings, following the workspace’s detailed commenting standard.

How to Add as a New Step
Make a new utility step in any pipeline for automated, always-up-to-date visual documentation:

text
- idx: LAST
  name: create_workflow_visual
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_workflow_viz
  function: run
  params:
    recipe: "recipes/my_pipeline.yaml"
    out: "Assets/my_pipeline_graph.png"
Summary
ctx_workflow_viz.py is a mission-critical utility for visualizing orchestrator workflows.

It’s essential for onboarding, error checking, and report generation.

Expansion to full DAG dependency parsing and metadata-rich visuals will greatly enhance its value and the professionalism of your automation framework.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ctx_view.py — Documentation
Objective
The purpose of ctx_view.py is to efficiently create a filtered, paginated, or summarized “view” of a large dataset held in the shared orchestrator context (ctx). It is mainly intended to serve small, relevant slices of potentially large data for UI dashboards (such as Dash) or for downstream scriptlets where loading an entire dataset into memory (or the frontend) would be inefficient or impractical.

Description
Provides a function, typically called run(ctx, params), that:

Filters the input list (typically a list of dicts) from ctx by matching key-value pairs.

Slices the filtered results to a specific page (for paginated requests), given page and page_size parameters.

Returns a structure with the resulting list slice (view) and the total number of records matched (total).

Can be directly used in orchestrator recipes or as a callable in Dash app callbacks to:

Quickly deliver a current filtered dataset to UI elements.

Implement paginated tables or summaries for dashboards.

Build efficient API/data endpoints in custom scriptlets without reimplementing filtering logic.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+

The script is standalone — relies only on the standard Python library (when used as specified).

Assumes the ctx variable exists and is a dictionary-like object.

No third-party libraries are required for the core logic.

Applications & Integration
In Orchestrator Recipes
Add data slicing or filters before visualizations, reporting, or to reduce memory/processing load for downstream steps.

In Dash Apps
Used in callbacks to display only rows matching current UI filters (e.g., search, selected date/category).

Used to implement pagination in Dash DataTables efficiently.

With Export/Reporting Scriptlets
Generate quick exports of currently filtered tables for CSV, Excel or reporting steps (by running ctx_view then passing the output).

Limitations
In-memory only: The function operates on data already residing in ctx—it does not fetch, save, or cache data itself.

Simple filtering: Only supports AND (all keys/values must match); no support for OR, ranges, or more advanced expressions.

No sorting: Returned order is the order in memory (unless the filtered list was previously sorted).

No aggregation: Does not summarize data (e.g., sum, mean); it just extracts rows.

Assumes input is a list of dicts (not lists of lists).

[Scalable but not optimized] For very large datasets, further enhancements or chunked processing may be required to prevent memory spikes.

Not designed for side effects: Only returns and stores the filtered view in output, does not update ctx[key] by default.

Usage
Function Signature
python
def run(ctx, params):
    # params: {
    #   "key": <str>,         # which ctx key to read from
    #   "filter": <dict>,     # dict of field: value for exact match (optional)
    #   "page": <int>,        # 0-based page index (optional, default: 0)
    #   "page_size": <int>    # number of records per page (optional, default: 100)
    # }
    ...
    # returns: {"view": [...], "total": <int>}
Example: Basic Filtering and Pagination
Consider you have the following data in ctx["test_data"]:

python
ctx["test_data"] = [
    {"id": 1, "status": "ok", "value": 42},
    {"id": 2, "status": "fail", "value": 99},
    {"id": 3, "status": "ok", "value": 16},
    # ... many more rows ...
]
1. Get the First Page (default size 100):
python
ctx_view.run(ctx, {"key": "test_data"})
# Returns: {"view": first 100 rows, "total": total number of rows}
2. Filter for Only status: ok
python
ctx_view.run(ctx, {"key": "test_data", "filter": {"status": "ok"}})
# Returns: {"view": all rows with status == "ok" (up to first 100), "total": count of status == ok}
3. Paginate Results (Page 2, 50 rows per page):
python
ctx_view.run(ctx, {"key": "test_data", "page": 1, "page_size": 50})
# Returns: {"view": rows 51-100, "total": total number of rows}
4. Combination: Filter and Paginate
python
ctx_view.run(
    ctx, {
        "key": "test_data",
        "filter": {"status": "fail"},
        "page": 2,
        "page_size": 10
    }
)
# Returns the third group of 10 rows where status == 'fail'
5. Store the view in ctx under a new key
If you wish to store the output in the context for future steps:

python
output = ctx_view.run(ctx, {...})
ctx["test_data_view"] = output["view"]
ctx["test_data_total"] = output["total"]
Example: Used in Dash Callback
python
@app.callback(
    Output('table', 'data'),
    [Input('status-dropdown', 'value'),
     Input('table-pagination', 'page_current'),
     Input('table-pagination', 'page_size')]
)
def update_table(selected_status, page, page_size):
    params = {
        "key": "test_data",
        "filter": {"status": selected_status} if selected_status else {},
        "page": page,
        "page_size": page_size
    }
    result = ctx_view.run(ctx, params)
    return result["view"]
Recommendations and Expansion Tips
1. Feature: Advanced Filtering
Add support for:

OR-conditions (e.g., match any of several values).

Range conditions (e.g., {"value__gte": 10, "value__lte": 100}).

Fuzzy/partial matches (especially for string fields).

Custom lambda/predicate filtering.

2. Feature: Sorting
Allow a parameter (e.g., "sort_by": "value", "reverse": True) to sort results before slicing.

3. Feature: Aggregation & Summaries
Support on-the-fly field summaries for filtered sets, e.g. sum/mean/count/min/max per field.

4. Feature: Chained Views
Accept a “view” as input, allowing outputs from one ctx_view call to be further filtered/paginated without starting from the full base data.

5. Feature: Store-to-ctx
Optionally take an "out" parameter to store the "view" and "total" automatically under ctx, not just return.

6. Feature: Performance Optimizations
Batch or chunk processing for truly massive lists (process only the chunk/page requested).

Use generators where possible to limit memory usage.

7. Feature: REST API Style Expansion
Mirror popular API query styles (filter, sort, offset, limit), so that Dash or external clients can easily integrate with the function.

8. Comprehensive Docstrings & CLI Mode
Ensure the script includes a multi-line docstring with:

Usage, arguments (with data types), description, limitations.

CLI mode for running as python ctx_view.py --key test_data --filter '{"status":"ok"}' --page 0 --page_size 20

Tips for Use in The Framework
Always validate the existence and type of the target ctx key to avoid errors.

Use in conjunction with other small, composable scriptlets (e.g., statistics or reporting).

Keep scriptlet atomic responsibilities—don’t allow filtering logic to creep into unrelated scriptlets.

Provide test coverage in tests/ that exercises both typical and edge-case usage (very small/large pages, no matches, invalid input).

Log all usage (in debug mode) for traceability and auditing.

Summary Table
Parameter	Type	Default	Description
key	string	required	Name of ctx dict/list to filter/slice
filter	dict	{}	Key-value pairs for row match (must all match)
page	int	0	0-based index of which page
page_size	int	100	Number of rows per page
out	string	None	Where (in ctx) to store the view (suggested for add)
By extending ctx_view.py along these lines, you gain a powerful, reusable and idiomatic component for efficient data slicing and paging in all orchestrator and dashboard needs!


-----------------------------------------------
Documentation for ctx_validate.py
Objective
The primary objective of ctx_validate.py is to ensure the integrity and correctness of data stored in the shared in-memory context (ctx) between orchestrator steps. By validating the existence of required keys and, optionally, their data types, this module helps prevent downstream errors, enforce contract compliance between scriptlets, and support robust, reproducible automation workflows.

Description
Purpose:
Validates that specific keys exist in the global context (ctx), and (optionally) that these keys are of expected types.

Role in the Framework:
Acts as a safeguard/checkpoint, typically used after one or more steps that populate or transform ctx, to guarantee that preconditions for subsequent steps are met. This enforces a “fail-fast” pattern that increases pipeline reliability.

Key Functions:

Checks that a list of required context keys exists (required list argument).

Optionally checks that values under these keys are of specified Python types (types dictionary argument).

Raises a clear ValueError on any missing key or type mismatch, supporting orchestration-level error handling.

Dependencies
Language/Version:
Python 3.6+

No third-party libraries required:
Only standard Python features (isinstance, exceptions).

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
Typical Applications
Gatekeeping Step:
Place at the start of a data processing or machine learning pipeline to assert that prerequisite data (from files or previous computations) is available and properly formatted.

Contract Enforcement:
Use whenever handing off ctx between teams or CI jobs, to enforce expected interface and reduce integration errors.

End-to-End Recipe Robustness:
Insert after data ingestion or transformation to make failures explicit and debuggable.

Example Use Case in an Orchestrator Recipe
text
- name: validate_normalized_data
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_validate
  function: run
  params:
    required: ["normalized_data", "meta"]
    types:
      normalized_data: list
      meta: dict
Explanation: This step ensures both normalized_data and meta exist in ctx and that their types are list and dict, respectively.

CLI/Python API Example
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_validate

ctx = {"numbers": [1,2,3], "info": {"experiment": "A"}}

# Simple required-key presence
ctx_validate.run(ctx, {"required": ["numbers", "info"]})
# This passes

# Required key and type
ctx_validate.run(ctx, {"required": ["numbers"], "types": {"numbers": list}})
# This passes

ctx_validate.run(ctx, {"types": {"info": dict}})
# This passes

# Type error
ctx_validate.run(ctx, {"types": {"numbers": dict}})
# This raises ValueError: ctx['numbers'] is not of type dict

# Missing key error
ctx_validate.run(ctx, {"required": ["doesnotexist"]})
# This raises ValueError: Missing required ctx key: doesnotexist

  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_validate
  function: run
  params:
    required: ["stats"]
    types:
      stats: dict
Limitations
Only Top-Level Key Checking:
Does not check for nested structures or values inside dicts/lists (e.g., dict field presence, array shape or dtype).

Only Basic Type Validation:
Checks using isinstance—does not validate against custom schemas, enums, or requirements like "non-empty list", "values between X and Y", “unique IDs”, etc.

No Runtime Custom Validation Logic:
There is no way to provide a custom lambda/validation function per key.

Does Not Mutate/Correct Data:
Only validates—does not attempt to coerce, fix, or fill missing/invalid data.

No Batch Reporting:
Raises at the first failure (missing key or bad type); does not aggregate/report all errors in a single call.

Usage Examples with Comments
python
# 1. Ensure required pipeline artifacts exist
ctx_validate.run(ctx, {"required": ["clean_data", "config"]})

# 2. Also check type
ctx_validate.run(ctx, {"required": ["raw_metrics"], "types": {"raw_metrics": list}})

# 3. Just check types (skip required list since those will be covered anyway)
ctx_validate.run(ctx, {"types": {"some_json": dict}})

# 4. Combination, including several different types
ctx_validate.run(ctx, {
    "required": ["row_list", "summary", "ids"],
    "types": {
        "row_list": list,
        "summary": str,
        "ids": list
    }
})

# 5. Example failure (raises ValueError, does not return a partial result)
try:
    ctx_validate.run(ctx, {"required": ["foo"], "types": {"foo": str}})
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
Recommendation: Enhancements and Feature Expansions
To improve the utility, flexibility, and maintainability of ctx_validate.py while adhering to orchestrator framework design philosophy, consider the following enhancements:

1. Nested Schema Validation
Feature: Allow users to specify and validate nested dictionaries/list structures, field presence, and basic constraints.

Example:

python
{
    "required": ["setup"],
    "schema": {
       "setup": {
           "type": dict,
           "fields": {
               "device": str,
               "location": str,
               "parameters": dict,
           }
       }
    }
}
Implementation: Traverse nested fields recursively, raise clear errors for missing/incorrect structure.

2. Length/Shape/Value Constraints
Feature: Support specification of list length, dict key count, allowed value ranges or sets for further robustness.

Example:

python
{
    "types": {"ids": list},
    "len": {"ids": 10},
    "in": {"device_type": ["sensorA", "sensorB"]}
}
3. Integration with Custom Validators
Feature: Allow providing a dict of lambdas or callable functions for arbitrary, per-key validation logic.

Example:

python
{
    "custom_validators": {
        "reading": lambda x: min(x) >= 0
    }
}
4. Aggregate Error Reporting
Feature: Collect and return/log (rather than raising at first failure) all errors found in ctx, making debugging easier and supporting batch validation.

Example:
Return a dictionary like {"missing": [...], "bad_types": {...}} or log to ctx/Logs.

5. Integration with Type Hints and Schema Libraries
Feature: Accept standard serialization schemas (pydantic, marshmallow, TypeGuards, or even simple JSONSchema).

Benefit: Reuses broader Python ecosystem standards, enables IDE/type checker support.

6. Integration Hooks and Auditing
Feature: Log all validation actions/errors into ctx["validation_log"] or the main orchestrator Logs file for auditability and traceability.

7. CLI Utility Improvements
Feature: Allow ctx_validate.py to be invoked as a CLI tool pointing to a file containing a context (JSON), with a schema as argument.

8. Dry-Run and Auto-Fix Modes
Feature: Add a dry-run mode (return would-fail validations without raising) and an auto-fix mode (e.g., fill missing keys with defaults if specified).

Tips and Best Practices
Always Use After Any Data Modification or Ingestion:
Use ctx_validate.run directly after file loads, database pulls, or transformations to catch pipeline errors early.

Combine Required Keys and Type Checks:
Use both "required": [...] and "types": {...} where possible.

Add Comments Describing Validation Purpose:
For complex pipelines, comment why certain keys/types are needed in the YAML or Python usage for maintainability.

Audit Validation Failures:
Always review logs or error output from this scriptlet to guide debugging; consider enhancing error reporting as above.

Summary
ctx_validate.py is a lightweight, composable, and essential utility for robust, correct workflow execution in the orchestrator framework. By enforcing the presence and type-compatibility of ctx keys, it forms a foundation for modular, safe, and debuggable pipelines.

Implementing the proposed enhancements will:

Enable richer schema and shape validation,

Improve error reporting,

Ease debugging and onboarding for new recipes,

And integrate with broader Python and orchestration ecosystem best practices.

These expansions should remain consistent with the orchestrator’s principles: atomicity, composability, auditability, and scriptlet independence.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_validate_schema.py — Comprehensive Documentation
Objective
Purpose:
To validate the schema, structure, and data integrity of one or more keys in the shared in-memory ctx (context) object used across orchestrator steps.

Why:
Ensure that the expected keys exist, have the correct types, and, optionally, have an expected length (such as for lists/arrays). This guarantees pipeline robustness by catching misconfigurations, step-order mistakes, or unexpected scriptlet outputs early.

Description
ctx_validate_schema.py is a small, composable utility scriptlet found in scriptlets/python/core/.
It is designed for:

Validating ctx data at step boundaries or before critical steps (e.g., before data analysis, exporting, or reporting).

Enabling defensive programming: catch missing or wrongly-typed data in the orchestrator flow, raising an error before silent failures propagate.

How it works:
You define a schema dictionary, whose keys correspond to the expected keys in ctx.
Each entry can specify:

A required type (e.g., list, dict, str)

An expected len value (number of elements, only if it makes sense for the type: e.g., lists)

It checks, for each specified key:

Does it exist in ctx?

Is it of the correct type?

If a length is specified, does it match?

If any check fails, an informative ValueError is raised, making it easy to debug recipe configuration issues.

Dependencies
Python: 3.6+

Standard Library: None outside basics: no third-party modules required for the core logic

Application, Integration, and Usage
Where used:

Insert this scriptlet before any step that would act on critical ctx content (e.g., data processing, exporting, AI summarization).

Use in integration/acceptance tests for pipelines, to enforce reproducibility.

Use in Dash pipelines to guarantee expected data structure for interactive apps.

CLI/Orchestrator Usage Example
In a YAML recipe step:

text
- name: validate_normalized_data
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_validate_schema
  function: run
  params:
    schema:
      normalized_data:
        type: list
        len: 100
      metrics:
        type: dict
      ai_summary:
        type: str
What this means:

ctx must have key normalized_data, which must be a list with 100 elements

ctx must have key metrics, which must be a dict

ctx must have key ai_summary, which must be a str

If any are missing or the type/size mismatches, the step will fail with an error message

Python In-Code Example
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_validate_schema

ctx = {"data": [1,2,3], "meta": {"info": "demo"}, "desc": "summary"}

result = ctx_validate_schema.run(ctx, {
    "schema": {
        "data": {"type": list, "len": 3},
        "meta": {"type": dict},
        "desc": {"type": str}
    }
})
# result == {'validated': ['data', 'meta', 'desc']}
Complex Schema Example (partial specification)
text
- name: validate_partial_schema
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_validate_schema
  function: run
  params:
    schema:
      timeseries:
        type: list
        # Do not check length, only ensure list type
      metrics:
        type: dict
      meta:
        # No type or length; only checks for presence
Example: Defensive Workflow in a Recipe
text
- name: load_large_data
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.my_loader
  function: run
  params:
    ...
- name: validate_loaded_data
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_validate_schema
  function: run
  params:
    schema:
      big_data:
        type: list
        len: 50000
- name: run_analysis
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.my_analysis
  function: run
  params:
    ...
This ensures failures will be caught before analysis, not after a downstream crash.

Example: Catching Errors
Suppose your ctx is {} (missing keys):

python
ctx = {}
# This will raise ValueError: Missing ctx key: foo
ctx_validate_schema.run(ctx, {"schema": {"foo": {"type": list}}})
If a key is present but the type is wrong:

python
ctx = {"foo": 123}
# Raises: ValueError: ctx[foo] is not <class 'list'>
ctx_validate_schema.run(ctx, {"schema": {"foo": {"type": list}}})
If length mismatches:

python
ctx = {"foo": [1,2]}
# Raises: ValueError: ctx[foo] length != 3
ctx_validate_schema.run(ctx, {"schema": {"foo": {"type": list, "len": 3}}})
Minimal Usage
Only check for presence:

python
ctx_validate_schema.run(ctx, {"schema": {"my_key": {}}})    # Validates existence only
Limitations
Granularity:
Only supports top-level key validation; no nested validation (e.g., types or shapes of sub-objects).

Static Types:
Does not validate the type/contents of elements inside lists or dicts (just the type of the key itself).

One-level Length:
len only checks the first level (e.g., length of a list; does not recurse).

Custom/Advanced Schemas:
Does not support custom validation logic, e.g., via callable or regex.

No Schema Templates:
Cannot load schema definitions from external YAML/JSON, must be specified inline per step.

Code Reference
python
def run(ctx, params):
    schema = params["schema"]
    for key, rules in schema.items():
        if key not in ctx:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing ctx key: {key}")
        if "type" in rules and not isinstance(ctx[key], rules["type"]):
            raise ValueError(f"ctx[{key}] is not {rules['type']}")
        if "len" in rules and len(ctx[key]) != rules["len"]:
            raise ValueError(f"ctx[{key}] length != {rules['len']}")
    return {"validated": list(schema.keys())}
Recommendations & Expansion Ideas
1. Nested Schema Validation:

Add support for validating nested fields, e.g.:

text
schema:
  my_dict:
    type: dict
    fields:
      id: {type: int}
      name: {type: str}
This lets orchestrator catch structure errors deeply.

2. Callable/Function-based Validation:

Allow a user-provided callable (function name/import path) for more complex checks, e.g. for lists of dicts:

text
schema:
  my_list:
    type: list
    check_elem: "scriptlets.python.utils.my_elem_validator"
This would be called for each element.

3. Collection Element Types:

Add syntax for specifying element types for lists/dicts, e.g.:

text
schema:
  my_list:
    type: list
    elem_type: dict
4. Accept External Schema Files:

Let schema be read from a YAML/JSON file, promoting DRY and consistency in large projects.

5. Optional/Required Keys and Defaults:

Expand schema to support optional keys and provide default values when missing.

6. Rich Error Aggregation and Reporting:

Instead of raising on first error, collect all validation errors and report them together in ctx/output logs for easy debugging.

7. Type Aliases & Enum Support:

Allow type to be specified as string (e.g., "int", "float", "enum:StatusEnum"), supporting serialization and custom classes/enums.

8. Integration with Type Annotations:

Use Python’s type hints/typing module for auto-generating schemas for common ctx patterns.

9. Conditional Validation:

Support conditional checks, e.g., "only apply this check if ctx[foo] is present/has value x".

10. Schema Discovery & Docs:

Add a small CLI to output schema expectations for auto-generated step docs, or to “dry run” schema validation for dev/test.

Best Practice Tips
Validate early, fail fast:
Add schema checks immediately after every data-loading, transformation, or external-input step.

Check before side effects:
Always validate before reporting, exporting, or pushing to DB.

Be specific:
Specify both type and len wherever possible for maximal robustness.

Re-use:
Factor common schemas into helper modules or config files for reuse.

Log/handle validation results:
Consider returning validation results to ctx or logs, not just raising, for better diagnostics.

Iterate:
Expand the logic as your data and workflow complexity grow; this module should grow from simple use cases toward deeper, type-validated flows.

Summary:
ctx_validate_schema.py is your orchestrator's first and best line of defense against ctx data errors. Use it liberally, improve it according to your actual pipeline needs, and consider the above recommendations as your workflows scale up!

Documentation for ctx_transform_timeseries.py
Objective
Enable declarative, reusable, and composable in-context transformation of timeseries data stored in the orchestrator's ctx (shared memory).
This scriptlet is designed to select specific columns, normalize data, and perform basic time series transformations on lists of rows, outputting the results to a new key (i.e., avoiding mutation of the input key).

Description
Atomic transformation of a ctx key containing timeseries data (list of lists: each row like [timestamp, val1, val2, ...]).

Supports:

Column selection via index (select).

Normalization of values (zero mean, unit variance).

Stores result in ctx[out].

Keeps source data untouched — supports reproducible, auditable dataflow.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+

NumPy (numpy) — required for fast numeric array operations (normalization, etc.).

Applications & Integrations
Typical Application:
Used as a recipe step to preprocess timeseries before analysis, statistical computation or dashboarding.

Where Integrated:

As a transformation/preprocessing step before plotting or stats calculation (e.g., for Dash visualization or ctx_stats.py analysis).

In multi-step pipelines that require normalized or filtered timeseries.

Can be batch-chained with other atomic scriptlets for robust pipelines.

Downstream Compatibility:
Output can directly feed:

Dash dashboards for plotting

Exporters (ctx_to_csv.py etc.)

Statistical analysis steps (ctx_stats.py)

Database loaders

Limitations
Input constraints:

Only works with ctx keys as lists of lists; doesn’t accept DataFrames or dicts.

All selected columns must be numerical for normalization to work.

Transformations:

Only basic: select columns and z-score normalize.

No advanced time series operations (no resampling, smoothing, windowing, time parsing, etc.).

No shape/schema validation:
Relies on correct pre-checks (can be enforced upstream with ctx_validate.py or ctx_validate_schema.py).

Does not infer column headers:
Operates strictly by column position (index), not by name.

No support for inplace modification:
Always outputs to a new key.

Usage
As a Recipe Step
Add to your recipe as:

text
- name: transform_timeseries
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_transform_timeseries
  function: run
  params:
    key: my_timeseries           # ctx input key, required
    out: my_timeseries_norm      # ctx output key
    select: [1,2]                # optional; select columns by index (0 = timestamp, typically skip)
    normalize: true              # optional; if True, normalize each column by z-score
Direct Python Usage
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_transform_timeseries

ctx = {
    "ts_raw": [
        ["2024-01-01T00:00:00", 10.0, 5.0],
        ["2024-01-01T01:00:00", 12.0, 7.0],
        ["2024-01-01T02:00:00", 9.0,  4.0]
    ]
}
ctx_transform_timeseries.run(ctx, {
    "key": "ts_raw",
    "out": "ts_selected",
    "select": [1,2],    # select value columns only
    "normalize": False
})
print(ctx["ts_selected"])  # Output: [[10.0, 5.0], [12.0, 7.0], [9.0, 4.0]]

ctx_transform_timeseries.run(ctx, {
    "key": "ts_raw",
    "out": "ts_z",
    "select": [1,2],
    "normalize": True   # get normalized values
})
print(ctx["ts_z"])
CLI-like Emulation
This scriptlet is not directly runnable as a CLI (no main guard), but you can wrap as:

text
python -c "
import sys; from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_transform_timeseries as s;
ctx = {'ts': [[1, 1.0, 2.0], [2, 2.0, 4.0], [3, 3.0, 8.0]]};
s.run(ctx, {'key': 'ts', 'out': 'ts_norm', 'select': [1,2], 'normalize': True});
print(ctx['ts_norm'])
"
More Usage Examples
Example 1: Only select columns (no normalization)
python
ctx_transform_timeseries.run(ctx, {
    "key": "my_data",
    "out": "sel_only",
    "select": [1]        # Select only first value column (skips timestamp)
})
Example 2: Select multiple columns & normalize
python
ctx_transform_timeseries.run(ctx, {
    "key": "my_data",
    "out": "sel_norm",
    "select": [1,2,3],
    "normalize": True
})
Example 3: No column selection, just normalization
If your timeseries is already values only, omit select:

python
ctx_transform_timeseries.run(ctx, {
    "key": "values_only",
    "out": "values_norm",
    "normalize": True
})
Edge Case: No selection & no normalization (just copies the array)
python
ctx_transform_timeseries.run(ctx, {
    "key": "raw",
    "out": "raw_copy"
})
API
python
def run(ctx, params):
    key = params["key"]      # (str) Input ctx key, required
    out = params["out"]      # (str) Output ctx key, required
    select = params.get("select", None)        # (list[int]) Optional. Column indices to select
    normalize = params.get("normalize", False) # (bool) Optional. Default False
    ...
    return {"transformed": out}
Recommendations & Enhancement Tips
Recommended Expansion Points
Robust Type & Shape Validation

Add clear error messages and auto-validation using utilities like ctx_validate.py or ctx_validate_schema.py.

Raise on ragged arrays or empty data.

Column Name Support

Accept column headers as input param, allow select by name or index.

E.g., "select": ["temperature", "humidity"].

Timestamps and Time Parsing

Add a param to parse or validate timestamps, optionally converting to datetime objects (as string for serialization).

Rich Transformations

Extend with more time series operations:

Rolling mean/median

Resampling (downsample/upsample by time interval)

Smoothing (e.g., Savitzky–Golay filter, EWMA)

Fourier/filter-based transformations

Use scipy for more advanced transforms if available, fallback to numpy if not.

Handling Missing Data

Add options for filling or dropping NaNs (e.g., dropna=True, fillna=0).

Pipeline-Style Chaining

Allow a transforms param as a list (e.g., normalize, then rolling mean).

Broadcast Output Schema

Optionally annotate resulting array with column info for downstream steps (for use in Dash tables).

In-Place Option

Optional param to write back to ctx[key], with strong warning.

General Tips
Keep scriptlet atomic: each function should do only one thing well (as in current implementation).

Always store outputs under new keys for traceability and reproducibility.

Document every new feature with usage and limitations in a docstring and add test cases in /tests/.

For Dash or reporting use, output shape and columns should be made clear (optionally, store column info as meta in ctx).

Encourage all users to validate the output shape using ctx_validate_schema.py before consuming the results.

Example Extension: Add Rolling Mean
python
window = params.get("rolling_window", None)
if window:
    arr = np.array(data, dtype=float)
    arr = np.lib.stride_tricks.sliding_window_view(arr, window_shape=window, axis=0).mean(axis=2)
    data = arr.tolist()
Test and Debug
Use the existing unit test pattern from /tests/ to add coverage (including shape assertions, type assertions, and edge cases).

Enable debug mode in ctx to log input/output for step reproducibility.

Summary:
ctx_transform_timeseries.py is a minimal, safe, and reusable atomic transformer for timeseries arrays, designed for pre-processing prior to stats, dashboarding, or AI analysis steps. Expand it via new parameters and transformations while maintaining atomicity, single-responsibility, and composability in orchestrator workflows.

Documentation for ctx_trace.py
Objective
The ctx_trace.py scriptlet is designed to facilitate traceability and step auditing by appending trace entries to the orchestrator's in-memory shared context (ctx). This helps in recording chronological step events, information, and diagnostics crucial for debugging, reporting, and automated workflows.

Description
What it Does:
ctx_trace.py introduces or appends to a list ctx["trace"] where each entry represents an event or milestone in the orchestration process.
Each trace entry is a dictionary with fields such as timestamp, step, and info message.

How it Works:
It is a lightweight, reusable utility function (run) which can be invoked with the current ctx and a parameters dictionary.
Typically, run is called with at least the keys:

"step": Name of the logical step being traced.

"info": Freeform message describing the event (e.g., "Started", "completed", state changes, errors, etc.)

Result:
After each invocation, an additional trace entry is appended to the ctx["trace"] list, creating a running log of actions and step transitions.

Dependencies
Python Version: 3.6+

Standard Library:

time (for generating timestamps)

There are no external dependencies for this scriptlet, making it portable and easy to integrate into any orchestrator step or Python module in this workspace.

Application, Integrations, and Usage
Application
Step Debugging: Use in any scriptlet or recipe step to record that a logical action or transition has occurred.

Workflow Auditing: Populate ctx["trace"] so that workflow status and transitions can be reconstructed post-mortem or for compliance documentation.

Dash/Reporting: The trace can be visualized live or post-run (e.g., in a Dash app, Excel, or log viewer).

Integration
Easily call in any orchestrator Python step by importing and running:

python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_trace import run as trace_run
trace_run(ctx, {"step": "normalize_csv", "info": "Started normalization"})
Can be included in custom/atomic step wrappers for automated per-step tracing.

Usage
Example 1: Step Start and Completion
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_trace import run as trace_run

# At the beginning of a step
trace_run(ctx, {"step": "data_cleaning", "info": "Step started"})

# ... your step code ...

# At the end of the step
trace_run(ctx, {"step": "data_cleaning", "info": "Step completed successfully"})
Example 2: Loop Progress Reporting
python
for i in range(5):
    # Simulate logic...
    trace_run(ctx, {"step": "data_import", "info": f"Imported chunk {i+1}/5"})
Example 3: Exception/Failure Notice
python
try:
    # critical logic
    pass
except Exception as e:
    trace_run(ctx, {"step": "load_excel", "info": f"Exception: {e}"})
    raise  # Proper error handling
Example 4: Structured Trace for Automated Analysis
python
trace_run(ctx, {"step": "ai_analyze", "info": "AI summary completed. Length: " + str(len(ctx['ai_summary']))})
Example 5: In Dash or Data Export
The contents of ctx["trace"] can be extracted and shown in a Dash table, Excel, or exported for compliance:

python
# Export to CSV
import csv
with open("Data/trace_log.csv", "w") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=["timestamp", "step", "info"])
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(ctx["trace"])
Limitations
Simplicity: Stores only flat, user-defined fields (timestamp, step, info)—does NOT record duration, memory, or nested events (these are handled by other scriptlets such as ctx_step_timer.py, ctx_step_audit.py).

Manual Granularity: All trace entries are what you specify; missing or inconsistent fields may occur if not standardized across calls.

No built-in log rotation: If used inside a high-frequency loop, ctx["trace"] can grow large for very long runs.

In-memory Only: Trace info is not persistent unless you explicitly serialize/dump ctx to disk after each run.

Top-level Info: Does not track hierarchical or nested actions; for detailed step timing, pair with ctx_step_audit.py or ctx_step_timer.py.

Detailed Usage Examples
Example YAML Recipe Usage
text
- name: run_step_one
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_trace
  function: run
  params:
    step: "step_one"
    info: "Step one started"
Or called within another scriptlet:

python
def run(ctx, params):
    from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_trace import run as trace
    trace(ctx, {"step": "extract_data", "info": "Extraction started"})
    # ... extraction logic ...
    trace(ctx, {"step": "extract_data", "info": "Extraction complete"})
    return True
Viewing or Exporting the Trace Log
python
for entry in ctx["trace"]:
    print(f"{entry['timestamp']}: [{entry['step']}] {entry['info']}")
or export as shown in the prior Data Export example.

Recommendations: Extending and Enhancing ctx_trace.py
1. Standardize Fields and Add Optional Metadata
Allow optional fields like level (e.g., "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR") and possibly user, session_id.

Example:

python
trace_run(ctx, {
    "step": "ai_summarize",
    "info": "Completed summary",
    "level": "INFO",
    "user": ctx.get("user", "unknown")
})
Update the function to accept arbitrary keyword fields, storing them in each entry.

2. Trace Levels and Filtering
Add ability to record and later filter by level.

Extend with a function to purge or retrieve only trace entries above a certain severity.

3. Duration and Context
Pair with timing decorators/context managers to automatically append start and end entries with durations—either integrate code from ctx_step_timer.py or add a helper context manager:

python
from contextlib import contextmanager, partial
@contextmanager
def traced_step(ctx, stepname):
    trace_run(ctx, {"step": stepname, "info": "Started"})
    t0 = time.time()
    try:
        yield
        trace_run(ctx, {"step": stepname, "info": f"Completed in {time.time()-t0:.2f}s"})
    except Exception as e:
        trace_run(ctx, {"step": stepname, "info": f"Failed: {e}", "level": "ERROR"})
        raise
4. Persistent Logging / Auto-Dumping
Add a feature or scriptlet to periodically or at end-of-run dump ctx["trace"] to disk (CSV or JSON; see also ctx_debug_dump.py).

5. Integration with Audit/Resource Scripts
Cross-link or merge with ctx_step_audit.py and ctx_step_timer.py to maintain comprehensive run records (trace + audit + resource use).

6. Event Emission
Allow trace to trigger "events" (optionally via integration with pub/sub scriptlets like ctx_pubsub.py) to notify dashboards or trigger alerts on, e.g., errors.

7. Visualization-friendly Format
Add convenience methods or scriptlets for formatting the trace log for direct Dash/JS/Excel table consumption.

8. Trace Size Management
Add max size or retention logic to prevent trace logs from exceeding a configured threshold (e.g., keep only N latest entries, or batch older logs to disk).

Best Practices
Always include meaningful step and info values for searchability and post-run review.

Use consistently in all custom scriptlets for ease of audit and troubleshooting.

Combine with other audit/resource scriptlets for highly granular pipeline introspection.

Always validate or sanitize info strings to ensure log parsing compatibility downstream.

Summary:
ctx_trace.py is a pivotal utility for operational visibility and post-mortem analysis in your orchestrator framework. While simple, its extensibility and integration potential are vast and highly compatible with your framework’s principles of modularity, traceability, and reliable error recovery. Enhanced with a few of the above suggestions, it can become a central node of your operational and debugging ecosystem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_trace_step.py – Full Documentation & Enhancement Suggestions
Objective
Provide a reusable, standardized tracer for step execution within the orchestrator pipeline and scriptlets.

Measure and record each step’s run time and memory usage with high granularity.

Append results to ctx["trace"] for debugging, profiling, pipeline auditing, and post-run analysis.

Support both context-manager and decorator patterns for flexibility and code cleanliness in scriptlets and step wrappers.

Description
ctx_trace_step.py implements two main features:

Context Manager trace_step:
Captures start time, end time, duration, memory usage at start/end, and peak memory for any block of code executed within its context.

Decorator trace_step_decorator:
Allows the same tracing logic to be applied to any function (including step implementations or scriptlet run() functions) in a Pythonic, reusable fashion.

What gets recorded

step: The step name or a unique label supplied by the caller.

start: Timestamp at code block entry (seconds since epoch, float).

end: Timestamp at block exit.

duration: Total wall-clock time (seconds).

mem_start: Memory used (bytes) at entry (from tracemalloc).

mem_end: Memory used at exit.

mem_peak: Peak memory consumption during the traced block.

Each entry is appended to ctx["trace"], maintaining a chronological, step-by-step trace log.

This mechanism supports scriptlet and orchestrator framework goals of auditability, debug traceability, resource monitoring, reproducibility, and systematic performance profiling.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library:

time

tracemalloc

contextlib

Framework-wide:

Relies on ctx (shared in-memory context object as per orchestrator pattern).

No third-party dependencies; works with the orchestrator’s Context class.

Applications and Integrations
Where/How to Use
Instrumentation of any step in a recipe for wall-clock and memory usage reporting.

Decorating scriptlet run(ctx, params) functions for automatic trace logging.

Dash apps or long-running background tasks, to gather fine-grained resource data over iterative events.

Example Integration in a Recipe
Suppose you have a Python scriptlet step:

python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_trace_step import trace_step

def run(ctx, params):
    with trace_step(ctx, "load_and_clean_data"):
        # Data loading and transformation code here
        ...
Or as a decorator:

python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_trace_step import trace_step_decorator

@trace_step_decorator(ctx, "transform_metrics")
def run(ctx, params):
    ...
Integration with Orchestrator Logging/Auditing
Traced entries appended to ctx["trace"] can be further exported, aggregated, and visualized by downstream reporting steps.

Use in conjunction with ctx_logger.py, ctx_audit_report.py for comprehensive run audits.

Limitations
Scope:

Only tracks resource usage for the block/function being traced; does not measure child processes or subprocesses unless within the same memory space.

Memory Measurement:

Uses tracemalloc which may not capture all OS-level memory spikes but is generally accurate for Python-allocated memory.

Step Labeling:

User must provide meaningful labels (step_name) for rich trace logs.

Manual Integration:

Developer must insert the context manager or decorator; non-instrumented code will not be traced.

Performance Overhead:

Minor additional CPU/memory for tracing; negligible but nonzero.

Usage – Detailed Examples
1. Context Manager Pattern
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_trace_step import trace_step

def run(ctx, params):
    # Traces this block, logs to ctx["trace"]
    with trace_step(ctx, "demo_step"):
        import time
        a = [i for i in range(10000)]
        time.sleep(1)
2. Decorator Pattern
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_trace_step import trace_step_decorator

@trace_step_decorator(ctx, "my_fancy_step")
def my_step(ctx, params):
    # This will be traced automatically
    ...

my_step(ctx, params)
3. Typical Post-Run Analysis
After running a recipe or test using these tracers:

python
print(ctx["trace"])
# [
#   {
#     'step': 'demo_step',
#     'start': 1703700000.9,
#     'end': 1703700002.10,
#     'duration': 1.2,
#     'mem_start': 1024000,
#     'mem_end': 1544000,
#     'mem_peak': 1544000
#   },
#   ...
# ]
4. In a multi-step orchestrator recipe
text
- idx: 1
  name: load_data
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.load_data
  function: run

- idx: 2
  name: clean_data
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.clean_data
  function: run
Instrument both load_data and clean_data scriptlets using trace_step to trace each as above.

5. Enhanced Parallel/Background Use
python
def background_job(ctx, params):
    with trace_step(ctx, "bg_job"):
        # Long-running computation
        ...
Recommendations and Expansion Suggestions
To further enhance and future-proof ctx_trace_step.py in ways that complement your framework standards, consider:

1. Add Logging Level/Type Field
Allow caller to specify an optional level or typ field (e.g., "INFO", "PROFILE", etc.) for greater log filtering and analysis.

2. Store Step Params in Trace
Append a copy (filtered for JSON-compatibility) of step parameters to each trace entry for reproducibility and richer reporting:

python
entry["params"] = params.copy()  # filtered for serializability
3. Nested/Hierarchical Step Tracing
Allow parent_step field for nested step tracing (hierarchical trace, substeps), supporting complex scriptlet calls or workflows.

4. Custom Trace Export/Flush
Provide utility to export trace logs to a CSV, JSON file, or database for external analysis/auditing.

5. Exception/Failure Flag
Add a field like status ("success" or "fail") and exception message when block raises an error, for unified error-resource traceability.

6. Batch Decorator for All Steps
Provide a registry or wrapper that auto-applies tracing to all scriptlets in a target folder (“auto-trace all run()”).

7. Integration with Resource Profilers
Optionally integrate with psutil for system-level CPU/IO and child process monitoring.

8. Dash/GUI Visualization Helper
Add a Dash or CLI dashboard helper module that visualizes timeline and resource consumption of all traced steps (Gantt chart, memory over time, etc.).

9. Asynchronous Trace/Streaming
(Advanced) For long-running or async pipelines, allow trace entries to be streamed/logged in real-time to disk or a monitor.

10. Trace Filtering/Query API
Expose API to search/filter traces by name, time, status, memory delta, etc.

Best Practices
Always use meaningful step names for easy post-run forensics (with trace_step(ctx, "fetch_raw_data"):).

Use tracing in both shell wrappers and Python scriptlets for holistic profiling.

Pair trace logs with error logs and audit reports for robust workflow reproducibility.

Validate/make serializable all params and context nodes for trace friendliness.

Keep trace logs as lightweight as practical—avoid excessive, fine-grained traces in data-processing loops unless needed.

This comprehensive tracing approach, compliant and in harmony with your orchestration framework’s principles (atomic, traceable, loosely coupled, independently testable scriptlets), ensures every key operation is measurable, auditable, and improvable for both development and production automation pipelines.
Let me know if you want example test/CI cases for this module, or integration with reporting features!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_to_file.py — Documentation
Objective
Persist a key from the shared in-memory context (ctx) to a file (in JSON or CSV format) within a customizable folder.

Enable cross-process sharing, auditing, or resumption of workflow, supporting both Python and shell scriptlets.

Enforce that only JSON-serializable objects are written out, ensuring reliable handoff between orchestration steps.

Description
ctx_to_file.py is a core scriptlet of the orchestrator framework.
It exports the contents of a particular key (ctx[key]) to an external file on disk, supporting two file formats:

JSON: Serializes the current value in ctx[key] to a JSON file.

CSV: Writes ctx[key] to a CSV file (requires a list of lists/rows).

The scriptlet:

Enables simple, standardized output for later consumption by other scriptlets, tools, or external systems.

Provides an API to configure the path, data format, and exported key.

May be called from within recipes, by Python scriptlets, or as a CLI utility for debugging or integration.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library:

json (for JSON serialization)

csv (for CSV I/O)

No third-party dependencies required.

Applications and Integrations
Integration as a recipe step

Use as a step to dump intermediate or final results to disk for logging, audit, handoff, or sharing.

Manual Export and Handoff

Dump ctx to files for checkpointing, resumption, or use from another process or framework.

Debug and Audit Trails

Export filters, stats, or results to human-readable files during workflow execution.

Can be used with version control or monitoring tools to track workflow state over time.

Shell Bridges

Enable interoperability between Python scriptlets pipeline and shell scripts by exporting data out of shared memory.

External Service Integration

Used before running tools that expect file inputs (e.g., Excel, SQL, visualization, or reporting tools).

Useful for step outputs that need to be consumed by non-Python tools.

Limitations
Input Data Format:

For format: csv, ctx[key] must be a list of lists (tabular row-wise structure); will raise an error otherwise.

For format: json, ctx[key] must be JSON-serializable (dict, list, etc.).

No Appending:

The scriptlet overwrites rather than appending to a file.

No Schema Enforcement:

No automatic header inference or type validation for CSV.

Basic Error Handling:

Errors such as missing key, path issues, or invalid format raise an immediate Python error.

Path Injection Risk:

Path for output is not sanitized; must ensure only allowed file locations are specified in params.

No Compression/Encryption:

Only plain data export; no compression or security features.

Not Multi-Sheet/Advanced:

For Excel or multi-tabular outputs, use the more advanced ctx_excel.py or ctx_excel_advanced.py.

Recommendations & Suggestions for Enhancement
In alignment with best practices and blueprint expansion set by your workspace (see README and UserGuide):

Atomic Write & File Locking

Use file locks or atomic move pattern to prevent incomplete writes (can borrow from or wrap ctx_file_lock.py).

Flexible Data Format Support

Add support for more formats: e.g., Excel (via openpyxl), Parquet (via pandas), or even Pickle for advanced usage.

Schema and Type Enforcement

Add schema validation for CSV (headers, column count) and for JSON keys (types, presence).

Append Mode

Add a parameter for append vs. overwrite (especially for CSV log/event use cases).

Compression

Allow optional gzip/bz2 output (Data/output.csv.gz), detecting extension or using a param.

Header Handling for CSV

Add options for header inclusion/exclusion and custom header row.

Error Handling and Audit Logging

Wrap with error handling context (see ctx_error_handler), add automatic ctx log entry with status.

Output Metadata

Optionally write a metadata file (YAML or JSON) alongside exported file with summary info (who exported, when, columns/types, etc).

CLI Entrypoint

Add a __main__ section supporting CLI args: python ctx_to_file.py --key foo --path out.csv --format csv.

Print helpful errors and summary on completion.

Security: Path Whitelisting

Validate/write only to allowed output directories to guard against path injection and accidental overwrite.

Multi-Sheet and Rich Table Export

For complex context (multiple side-tables), extend or reuse logic from ctx_excel.py/ctx_excel_advanced.py.

Automatic Output Name Suggestions

If no output path given, auto-suggest a path like Data/<key>_<date>.csv or .json.

Integration with Journal/Audit Trail

Each export can log its action to the audit log (ctx["audit"]) for future traceability.

Summary
ctx_to_file.py offers a simple, composable, and reliable interface to write context data to disk.
This enables interoperability, persistence, and auditability for your orchestrator automation pipelines.
With future enhancements, this utility can become a robust bridge between all automation steps, maintaining both minimalism and flexibility as per the framework’s philosophy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_to_csv.py – Documentation
Objective
Export ctx data for external interoperability:
ctx_to_csv.py provides a minimal, reusable mechanism for exporting an in-memory context (ctx) key containing a list of lists as a CSV file.

Bridge between orchestrator workflows and outside tools:
CSV files can be consumed by shell tools, spreadsheets, and visualization tools not natively integrated into the orchestrator pipeline.

Description
Atomic scriptlet:
This scriptlet is atomic, JSON-serializable safe, and focused on a single responsibility—writing structured ctx data to CSV.

Compatability:
The scriptlet expects the data stored in ctx[key] to be a list of lists (e.g., a table’s rows, potentially with headers).

Flexible invocation:

Can be run as a standalone CLI tool ("python ctx_to_csv.py --key my_key --out my.csv") or as a step within a YAML recipe in orchestrator.

Returns a dictionary noting the CSV file written, to support dependency chains in recipes.

Designed for integration:

Designed to enable easier consumption of ctx-generated data by downstream shell steps and human users.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+

No third-party libraries required for the main function (uses Python's standard csv and argparse modules).

Workspace runner integration:

Relies on ctx being a standard dict-like object (see Context class in context.py).

Applications & Integration
Within Orchestrator Recipes
Use as a Python step after any previous step that computes or transforms a tabular dataset in ctx.

Example recipe step:

text
- name: export_rows_to_csv
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_to_csv
  function: run
  params:
    key: new_row
    out: Data/new_row_output.csv
Downstream shell steps or human users can pick up the resulting CSV.

Direct CLI Usage
To debug or extract intermediate data from orchestrator state:

text
python ctx_to_csv.py --key my_table --out output.csv
The script creates a sample dummy ctx if run from the command-line with no orchestrator context.

Integration Example
Suppose a test recipe has a computed result table to share with other tools:

Compute or transform your result as

python
ctx["result_table"] = [
    ["timestamp", "temperature", "humidity"],
    ["2025-08-25T12:00:00", 23.4, 46],
    ["2025-08-25T12:01:00", 24.0, 45],
]
Export:

text
- name: save_results
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_to_csv
  function: run
  params:
    key: result_table
    out: Data/results.csv
Cross-environment Export
Output CSVs can be opened in Excel, LibreOffice, or imported into Pandas with read_csv, or consumed by Unix tools (e.g., awk, sed, cut).

Limitations
Input restrictions:

Only works for ctx[key] that is a list of lists. It will not flatten dict-of-list (use a ctx transformation step before export if required).

The user is responsible for ensuring that the first inner list contains headers, if column headers are desired.

No support for column typing or quoting/csv dialects:

It uses the default settings of Python’s csv.writer: all values are stringified as-is.

No data validation or schema enforcement:

Non-rectangular rows may result in malformed CSVs.

No incremental/batch export:

Designed for atomic table dumps only.

Not suitable for very large (millions of rows) datasets:

For large data, consider using chunked export or workspace's advanced data loader tools.

Usage Examples
Minimal Example – Standalone
If you have a ctx key "my_data":

python
ctx = {
    "my_data": [
        ["time", "value_a", "value_b"],
        ["2025-08-25T08:00:00", 12, 34],
        ["2025-08-25T08:10:00", 15, 28]
    ]
}
run(ctx, {"key": "my_data", "out": "Data/my_data.csv"})
Result: A file named Data/my_data.csv containing:

text
time,value_a,value_b
2025-08-25T08:00:00,12,34
2025-08-25T08:10:00,15,28
CLI Example (from terminal)
text
python scriptlets/python/core/ctx_to_csv.py --key new_row --out Data/new_row_export.csv
This will write a demo ctx["new_row"] to Data/new_row_export.csv.

Recommendations & Enhancement Suggestions
1. Support for More Data Structures:

Add an option to accept a list of dicts and automatically extract fieldnames (using csv.DictWriter), making it easier for users to export more complex results.

2. CSV Dialect/Options:

Add support for specifying CSV dialect, delimiter, quoting, line terminator, or encoding for interoperability with strict third-party tools.

3. Chunked/Streamed Export:

For very large data, add batching so only one chunk is written at a time.

Consider yielding progress back to ctx for monitoring.

4. Header Row Auto-detection:

Optionally detect and write header row if not explicitly provided.

5. Schema/Validation Integration:

Integrate with schema validators (see ctx_validate.py or ctx_validate_schema.py) to ensure table consistency before exporting.

6. Enhanced Logging:

Optionally log the export event in ctx (append to ctx["log"] and/or global logs).

7. Error Handling and User Feedback:

Raise clear ValueError if keys/format don’t match requirements, and return detailed output on failure.

8. Return Number of Rows Written:

Enhance the returned dictionary to include the length of exported rows (excluding header).

9. Cross-process/Orchestrator Hook:

Allow registration as an auto-discovered scriptlet via a registry (supports the expansion path detailed in your README).

10. Security/Path-safety:

Sanitize and/or restrict allowed file output paths to avoid path injection risks.

11. Metadata export:

Optionally write metadata (export time, ctx keys, user) to a sidecar .json file.

Conclusion:
ctx_to_csv.py is an atomic and robust scriptlet—ideal for interoperability, quick debugging, or workflow branching. Expanding its input structure and output options will align it even better with the scalable, plug-and-play philosophy of your orchestrator workspace.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for ctx_table_view.py
Objective
Purpose:
To provide a utility that formats data stored in a shared context (ctx) into a structure suitable for interactive data table display, notably for dashboard frameworks such as Dash’s dash_table.DataTable, or for frontend tabular interfaces.

Its aim is to bridge the gap between raw results (lists of lists or dicts, as per the orchestrator’s shared memory model) and graphical/tabular visualization, ensuring a JSON-serializable and presentation-ready format.

Description
The ctx_table_view.py scriptlet processes a key in the orchestrator’s in-memory ctx (context dictionary) and prepares a representation for tabular display:

Input:
Takes as input a ctx key whose value is either:

a list of dicts (each dict = a table row, with matching keys as columns),

or a list of lists (each sublist = table row, columns inferred as col0, col1...).

Output:
It generates a dict with:

columns: List of dicts with name and id for each column,

rows: List of dicts, each mapping column id to cell value for that row.

The output structure matches the requirements of Dash’s DataTable, or any UI table component expecting explicit column headers and structured rows.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library: None beyond built-in types, as per workspace standards (no external dependencies).

Context: Requires a valid orchestrator ctx in dict/list format. No direct dependencies on pandas or table backends.

Compatibility: Works with Python ≥3.6, and all orchestrator data types that are JSON-serializable.

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
A. Basic Recipe Step
As a step in an orchestrator recipe (YAML example):

text
- name: format_summary_table
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_table_view
  function: run
  params:
    key: summary_data        # ctx["summary_data"] must be list of dicts or lists
    out: formatted_table     # Result will appear at ctx["formatted_table"]
B. As a Standalone Python Call
Example 1: List of Dicts
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_table_view
ctx = {
    "foo": [
        {"A": 1, "B": "x"},
        {"A": 2, "B": "y"}
    ]
}
ctx_table_view.run(ctx, {"key": "foo", "out": "foo_table"})
# ctx["foo_table"] will be:
# {
#   "columns": [{"name": "A", "id": "A"}, {"name": "B", "id": "B"}],
#   "rows": [{"A": 1, "B": "x"}, {"A": 2, "B": "y"}]
# }
Example 2: List of Lists
python
ctx = {
    "bar": [
        [10, "alice"],
        [20, "bob"]
    ]
}
ctx_table_view.run(ctx, {"key": "bar", "out": "bar_table"})
# ctx["bar_table"]:
# {
#   "columns": [{"name": "col0", "id": "col0"}, {"name": "col1", "id": "col1"}],
#   "rows": [{"col0": 10, "col1": "alice"}, {"col0": 20, "col1": "bob"}]
# }
Example 3: Direct for Dash DashTable
python
from dash import Dash, dash_table
import ctx_table_view

ctx = {
    "dataset": [
        {"Date": "2023-01-01", "Value": 12.5},
        {"Date": "2023-01-02", "Value": 14.3}
    ]
}
ctx_table_view.run(ctx, {"key": "dataset", "out": "data_table"})
columns = ctx["data_table"]["columns"]
rows = ctx["data_table"]["rows"]

app = Dash(__name__)
app.layout = dash_table.DataTable(
    columns=columns,
    data=rows
)
app.run_server(debug=True)
C. Integrating with Other Steps
Can be used after data aggregation, stats calculation, or AI/pandas summarization for easy export to Excel, Dash, or reports.

Enables UI code to focus on visualization, ignoring messy data wrangling.

Limitations
Input Format:
Only processes lists of dicts or lists. Other structures (e.g., scalar, single-dict, nested) will silently yield empty output.

No Type Inference:
All values are presented as-is; type conversions, formatting, or spanning cell support are not provided.

No Complex Headers:
Does not support hierarchical/multi-row column headers.

Column Naming (for lists):
If input is a list of lists, column names are auto-generated as col0, col1, etc., with no semantic info.

No Sorting, Filtering, or Paging:
Pure presentation formatting; paging/filtering is expected to be performed upstream or UI-side.

No Support for Non-Serializable Data:
As with all ctx use, data must be JSON-serializable.

Detailed Usage Examples
Example 4: In a Multi-Step Recipe
Suppose your ctx after previous step:

python
ctx["metrics"] = [
    {"Name": "foo", "Score": 3.2},
    {"Name": "bar", "Score": 8.8}
]
Recipe Step:

text
- name: format_metrics
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_table_view
  function: run
  params:
    key: metrics
    out: metrics_table
Result:

ctx["metrics_table"] will be ready for Dash DataTable, Excel export or Markdown rendering.

Example 5: Recipe Table Step with Dynamic Output
You can auto-name the output table by omitting out:

text
- name: auto_format_mydata
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_table_view
  function: run
  params:
    key: mydata
# Result: ctx["mydata_table"], handy for bulk workflow!
Example 6: Usage with Lists of Varying Length
If input rows have inconsistent length (in lists), columns default to largest found, missing values will be omitted (beware for tabular UI).

Recommendations for Enhancement
To expand capabilities and better serve real-world data table scenarios, consider the following:

1. Support for Pandas DataFrames
Add detection and conversion if ctx[key] is a DataFrame (optional, to leverage pandas).

This improves interoperability with steps using pandas for computation.

2. Column Aliasing and Custom Headers
Allow user to pass an optional columns parameter to define custom headers, alias internal names, or set column order explicitly:

text
params:
  key: foo
  out: foo_table
  columns:
    - name: "Custom Name"
      id: "A"
    - name: "Other", id: "B"
3. Data Type/Formatting Metadata
Add type inference (int, float, date) and attach metadata in columns field, e.g. for Dash type-aware columns.

Allow optional formatting strings per column.

4. Error Reporting and Input Validation
If input is malformed or not list-like, raise a clear error or provide an informative warning in the output.

5. Empty Cell and Row Handling
Option to fill missing values with a specified placeholder (e.g., "" or None).

6. Advanced Table Features
Add parameters for:

Sorting by column(s)

Filtering rows or columns server-side by value or pattern

Slicing (paging) support (page, page_size)

For Dash, support conditional formatting, multi-index columns, etc.

7. Direct Report Export/Download Integration
Add an option to immediately write the formatted table to CSV or Excel (reusing ctx_to_csv.py/ctx_excel.py).

8. Accessibility Features
Support for ARIA attributes in column dicts (for web accessibility in tables).

9. Automatic Schema Detection
Combine with existing ctx_validate_schema.py or extend with a schema generator helper.

10. Composability
Output data could include a processing provenance (e.g., track which ctx key and transformation was used), aiding auditing and traceability.

Conclusion:

ctx_table_view.py is a small but powerful bridge: it decouples in-memory pipeline results from tabular UIs.

Keep it simple and composable, avoid embedding monolithic logic: let it do formatting, and leave data reshaping or business logic to other well-defined steps.

Use as a pattern: all presentation-facing data should be normalized in this manner for UI/report integration.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_sqlite.py — Detailed Orchestrator Documentation
1. Objective
ctx_sqlite.py provides SQLite database integration for the orchestrator framework, allowing any step in a recipe to create, query, or modify SQLite tables using data from the in-memory ctx. This enables robust persistence, reporting, and cross-process data interaction, leveraging the simplicity and ubiquity of SQLite within automated pipelines.

2. Description
This file enables orchestrator steps (scriptlets or recipe actions) to:

Insert lists of dictionaries from ctx into named SQLite tables.

Execute arbitrary SQL SELECT queries and store results in ctx for further processing, reporting, or dashboard display.

Work seamlessly within orchestrator pipelines — reading/writing to Data/my.db or any path.

Support cross-language and cross-step data bridging (shell ↔ python, python ↔ Dash, etc).

Typical workflow:

Collect/process data in ctx.

Persist to SQLite using this module.

Query/summarize/visualize using future/orchestrator steps.

3. Requirements / Dependencies
Python: 3.6+
Libraries:

Standard Library:

sqlite3 (for SQLite database connection and querying)

No third-party dependencies are required for this core functionality, ensuring robust portability and low friction.

4. Applications, Integration, and Usage
Standalone Scriptlet Usage
python
# Example of invoking from another Python script or scriptlet:
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_sqlite
ctx = {...}  # fill with your data

# Insert data
ctx_sqlite.run(ctx, {
    "db": "Data/my.db",
    "table": "metrics",
    "key": "metrics_data",  # ctx["metrics_data"] must be a list of dicts
    "action": "insert"
})
Recipe Step Usage
text
- name: insert_metrics_to_db
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_sqlite
  function: run
  params:
    db: Data/my.db
    table: metrics
    key: metrics_data     # ctx["metrics_data"] is a list of dicts
    action: insert
Run Arbitrary Query
python
# Query example
ctx_sqlite.run(ctx, {
    "db": "Data/my.db",
    "query": "SELECT AVG(value) FROM metrics WHERE timestamp > '2025-08-01'",
    "out": "avg_metrics"
})
# Result is now in ctx["avg_metrics"]
text
- name: fetch_metric_avg
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_sqlite
  function: run
  params:
    db: Data/my.db
    query: SELECT AVG(value) FROM metrics
    out: avg_metrics   # (optional, defaults to "sql_result")
Scriptlet API
To insert a batch of records in ctx to a SQLite table:

python
ctx["my_records"] = [
  {"id": "1", "value": "5.1", "note": "ok"},
  {"id": "2", "value": "7.8", "note": "fail"}
]
ctx_sqlite.run(ctx, {
    "db": "Data/run.db",
    "table": "results",
    "key": "my_records",
    "action": "insert"
})
To extract all records:

python
ctx_sqlite.run(ctx, {
    "db": "Data/run.db",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM results",
    "out": "all_results"
})
Now, ctx["all_results"] is a list of tuples (rows).

Within Orchestrator/Dash:
Store in ctx, then allow Dash or reporting steps to pull/query as needed.

Enables report generation, dashboard visualization, and (with expansion) advanced analytics.

5. Limitations
Only supports list-of-dict records for insertion; other data structures (e.g., list of lists) must be transformed.

Table columns are derived from the first dictionary’s keys — assumes a uniform record structure.

All columns are stored as TEXT regardless of original type. This may limit type fidelity and query power.

No schema validation or enforcement (ctx dict keys dictate schema).

Error handling is minimal (e.g., will fail if types are inconsistent or DB is locked).

Does not support bulk upsert, update, or deletion operations natively.

SQL injection is possible if user supplies unsanitized SQL in the query parameter. DO NOT pass arbitrary/user input directly.

No index or constraint management — for advanced DB design, schema migrations, or data validation, external tools/scripts are required.

6. Example Flows

7. Detailed Reference
Parameter	Type	Effect
db	string (filepath)	SQLite database filename, e.g. Data/my.db (autocreated if missing)
action	string	If "insert", inserts ctx[key] to table
key	string	Name of ctx field holding list-of-dicts to insert
table	string	Name of the SQLite table
query	string	Arbitrary SQL string to run, e.g. SELECT ...; result stored in ctx[out]
out	string	(optional) ctx key where query result will be stored (default: "sql_result")
Return Values
Inserts:
{ "inserted": <number of rows> }

Query:
{ "rows": <number of rows> } and places data in ctx[out]

Other:
{ "status": "noop" } if no action taken

8. Recommendations & Expansion Suggestions
To expand and enhance ctx_sqlite.py in compliance with your orchestrator best practices and workspace philosophy:

a. Support for Data Types
Infer and support primitive types (INTEGER, REAL, TEXT) for automatic schema generation.

Optionally allow user to specify field types in params, e.g.:

text
fields:
  id: INTEGER
  value: REAL
  note: TEXT
b. Upsert/Update/Delete/Batch
Add actions for update, delete, and upsert with parameters for match fields and values.

c. Schema Validation and Migration
Add checks for table schema before insert.

Optionally run migrations (ALTER TABLE, create indexes) as part of the step.

d. Bulk Query Results as Dict
Convert fetched SQL rows to list-of-dict (with column names) for easier downstream use.

e. Parameterized Queries
Support parameterized queries using ctx keys as input, e.g.,

text
query: "SELECT * FROM metrics WHERE id = ?"
params: [ctx:record_id]
f. Error Logging and Tracing
Integrate with global ctx error/logging utilities to trace and record all SQL errors and exceptions.

g. Security
Validate and restrict file path param (prevent path traversal).

Sanitize/validate SQL query for safer use in untrusted context.

h. Recipe Example + Unit Tests
Provide sample recipes that demo insert/query.

Add unit tests for error cases, schema mismatches, etc.

i. Export and Import
Add a helper to export tables to CSV or import from CSV (augmenting Data <-> DB bridge).

j. Orchestrator Integration
Allow Dash/report/external steps to consume outputs created by ctx_sqlite easily (document ctx keys flow).

9. Tips for Best Practice
Always validate that ctx[key] is a list of dicts before calling insert action.

Never store non-JSON-serializable objects in ctx; convert complex objects before persist.

Unique table names: When batching, use unique names per workflow/test run or clean up tables post-test.

Use small, focused recipe steps: One step for "insert", a separate (parametrized) one for "query".

For large result sets, consider paginated SELECTs or SQL LIMIT/OFFSET to avoid memory bloat.

Clearly document any schema expectations or assumptions in recipe comments and step descriptions.

Summary:
ctx_sqlite.py is a modular, low-dependency bridge from in-memory orchestrator state (ctx) to on-disk/queryable SQLite databases. Expand it to support richer SQL workflows, robust error handling, and seamless integration with other automation/pipeline/reporting steps—all while keeping scriptlet logic single-purpose and well-documented per your workspace’s standards.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File: scriptlets/python/core/ctx_snapshot.py
1. Objective
The primary objective of ctx_snapshot.py is to take a complete, serializable snapshot of the orchestrator’s in-memory context (ctx) at any point and store that state to a JSON file. This enables auditability, reproducibility, debugging, and safe workflow resumption by preserving the exact data state inter-step.

2. Description
Purpose:
Create a persistent, timestamped, JSON-format export of the current ctx, which holds the shared state/data between orchestrator steps.

How it Works:

The run(ctx, params) function is called with the current context and a parameter dictionary.

The function looks for an out key in params:

If params["out"] is provided, it uses that as the output filename.

If not, it creates a unique timestamped filename like Data/ctx_snapshot_<timestamp>.json.

The function saves a full, serializable copy of the current context ctx as JSON to this file.

Why It Matters:
In orchestrated pipelines, the ability to persist, inspect, and restore state is critical for:

Failure recovery (resume after error)

Auditing pipeline history

Debugging and troubleshooting

Comparing before/after transformations

3. Dependencies
Python Standard Library:

json: To serialize and save the context to a JSON file.

time: To generate unique timestamps for output file names.

Framework Requirements:

ctx must be JSON-serializable at all times (enforced by your Context class).

Output path (default: under Data/) must be writeable.

4. Application & Integration
Primary Usage Patterns
As a Recipe Step:

text
- name: snapshot_ctx
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_snapshot
  function: run
  params:
    out: Data/ctx_snapshot_20250826.json
or, for auto-naming:

text
- name: snapshot_ctx
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_snapshot
  function: run
  params: {}
From Python Code:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_snapshot
snap_info = ctx_snapshot.run(ctx, {"out": "Data/snapshot_custom.json"})
print(snap_info)  # {'snapshot': 'Data/snapshot_custom.json'}
Common Integration Scenarios
Before and After a Major Step:
Take snapshots before and after transformations to enable diff checks or rollback.

On Failure/Error Traps:
Automate snapshotting ctx when catching exceptions for post-mortem analysis.

Automated Debugging:
Schedule snapshots periodically or after each step for a detailed audit log.

Example with Auto-Timestamp
python
ctx_snapshot.run(ctx, {})  # Will save e.g., Data/ctx_snapshot_1693056299.json
As a CLI Step in a Recipe
text
- name: before_ai_analysis_snapshot
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_snapshot
  function: run
  params: {}
- name: ai_analysis
  ...
- name: after_ai_analysis_snapshot
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_snapshot
  function: run
  params:
    out: Data/post_ai_analysis.json
For Debugging
After rerunning a failed recipe, compare automatic snapshots for what changed.

Use with ctx_restore.py to implement full state rollback or re-execute with the same in-memory data.

5. Limitations
Data Size:
Serialization and saving very large ctx objects may be slow or result in very large JSON files.

Serialization:
All ctx data must always be completely JSON-serializable—open file handles, sockets, or custom non-serializable objects will cause errors (enforced upstream in your Context class).

Atomicity:
File write is not atomic; there may be incomplete files if interrupted.

No Versioning/History by Default:
Old snapshots are not auto-pruned or indexed beyond their timestamped filenames.

No Encryption/Privacy:
Snapshots are plain text JSON files; confidential data inside ctx will be visible as-is.

6. Examples
Minimal Usage
python
import ctx_snapshot
ctx = {...}  # your orchestrator context
info = ctx_snapshot.run(ctx, {})
print(info["snapshot"])  # e.g. "Data/ctx_snapshot_1693056299.json"
Custom Output Location
python
ctx_snapshot.run(ctx, {"out": "Data/custom_snapshot.json"})

7. Recommendations & Expansion Suggestions
A. Recommended Enhancements (Framework-Compliant)
1. Metadata Inclusion

Include meta-information in the snapshot file (e.g., timestamp, triggering step, orchestrator version, recipe hash).

Example snapshot format:

json
{
  "_meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-08-26T03:04:05Z",
    "created_by": "snapshot_ctx",
    "recipe": "recipes/foo.yaml"
  },
  "ctx_data": {...}
}
2. Automatic Pruning/Rotation

Optionally keep only N most recent snapshots to save disk space.

Parameter: retain: 5 to delete oldest when a new one is written.

3. Compression

Support writing snapshots as .json.gz if requested, to reduce disk usage.

4. Schema/Size Validation

Optionally verify that the context is not too large or non-conformant, and warn or refuse snapshot if it would violate limits.

5. "Diff" Support

Built-in, optional diffing against another snapshot (diff_with: path/to/other.json) to aid in debugging.

6. Encryption (for Confidential Workspaces)

Optional AES encryption for snapshot payloads if a key is provided.

7. Restore Helper

Add a “restore” mode or direct integration with ctx_restore.py.

Example:

text
- name: snapshot_ctx
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_snapshot
  function: run
  params:
    restore: "Data/ctx_snapshot_xxx.json"
8. Snapshot Hooks

Allow recipe steps to trigger custom hooks (e.g., post-snapshot notification, Slack alert, etc.).

9. Step-Integrated Auditing

Tie snapshot events directly into ctx["audit"] with archive path, triggering step, etc. for centralized tracking.

B. Code Expansion Example (with Metadata)
python
import json, time
def run(ctx, params):
    out = params.get("out") or f"Data/ctx_snapshot_{int(time.time())}.json"
    meta = {
        "timestamp": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ", time.gmtime()),
        "created_by": params.get("by", "ctx_snapshot"),
        "ctx_keys": list(ctx.keys())
    }
    data = {"_meta": meta, "ctx_data": dict(ctx)}
    with open(out, "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
    return {"snapshot": out}
This is fully backward-compatible for restoring with a small tweak in ctx_restore.py.

8. Summary
ctx_snapshot.py is a critical utility for the workspace’s audit, debug, rollback, and reproducibility guarantees.

Use it before/after major steps, on error, or at key transitions.

For extension, add metadata, pruning, compression, validation, and security options in line with best practices of the orchestrator framework.

Keep all enhancements fully backward-compatible and focused on small, composable features per scriptlet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for ctx_shell_helper.sh
Objective
Purpose:
ctx_shell_helper.sh serves as a bridge between the orchestrator's Python-based shared in-memory context (ctx) and shell scriptlets, making it possible for shell scripts to consume in-memory data as environment variables.

Goal:
Enable shell steps to view and process selected keys from ctx, especially when exported as environment variables using the orchestrator's expose_for_shell utility.

Description
Functionality:

Reads the environment for variables that follow the pattern CTX_*, which is the standard naming convention when exporting ctx values for shell consumption.

Pretty-prints each detected variable and its value in (pseudo-)JSON format.

Allows shell scripts to see current in-memory data as soon as it's made available by the orchestrator or a previous Python step.

How It Works:

You call ctx_shell_helper.sh in any shell step.

It inspects all environment variables for those starting with CTX_.

It emits them as a JSON-like object (key/value pairs) for human readability and debugging.

Application, Integration, and Usage
Direct CLI Usage Example
bash
# Simulate usage: export two ctx keys to CTX_ variables
export CTX_FOO='{"val": 123}'
export CTX_BAR='["a", "b", "c"]'
bash scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh
Output:

text
{
  "FOO": {"val": 123},
  "BAR": ["a", "b", "c"],
}
As a Shell Step in a Recipe
text
- name: print_ctx_env
  type: shell
  cmd: scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh
  # No args; expects relevant CTX_ variables from orchestrator
With Orchestrator Integration
Suppose a prior Python step populates the context:

python
ctx["metrics"] = [1, 2, 3]
ctx["user"] = {"id": 7}
When scheduled as a shell step, orchestrator can export these keys as environment variables:

text
- name: pretty_print_ctx
  type: shell

  shell_env_keys: ["metrics", "user"]
runner.py (using expose_for_shell) transforms values (JSON-serializable) into:

bash
export CTX_METRICS='[1, 2, 3]'
export CTX_USER='{"id": 7}'
bash scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh
Sample Output from Complex ctx
If you export complex nested structures in ctx:

bash
export CTX_DEVICE='{"name": "sensorA", "readings": [12.5, 13.2]}'
bash scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh
Output:

text
{
  "DEVICE": {"name": "sensorA", "readings": [12.5, 13.2]},
}
With Filtering or Piping
To only print certain variables:

bash
bash scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh | grep '"DEVICE"'
Dependencies
Bash shell: Required for script execution.

Standard Unix utilities:

env, grep, printf, and basic shell built-ins.

Upstream requirement:
The orchestrator (or manual setup) must export ctx keys as environment variables with a CTX_ prefix.

Limitations
Only works for environment variables exported with a CTX_ prefix.

Does not decode or pretty-print deeply nested JSON—prints the value verbatim.

No direct parsing or transformation—just pretty printing. Does not provide jq-like query.

If a variable's value is not valid JSON, it still prints it as-is (may appear as a string).

Not suitable for non-JSON-serializable types (those should not be exported from ctx anyway).

Does not set, unset, or modify ctx variables, only displays them.

Assumes variables are fresh and up to date (cannot fetch from orchestrator directly).

Intended for debugging and environment inspection, not business logic.

Usage Examples
Print all exported ctx keys as JSON
bash
# Suppose orchestrator exposes in-memory ctx as: CTX_A, CTX_B
bash scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh
Export and view from a Python step
python
from context import Context, expose_for_shell
ctx = Context()
ctx['foo'] = [100, 200]
env = expose_for_shell(ctx, ["foo"])
# In the shell, do:
# export CTX_FOO='[100, 200]'
# bash scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh
Within a Shell Scriptlet Chain
bash
source <(python my_env_exporter.py)  # Sets CTX_* from Python/ctx
bash scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh
Recommendations and Expansion Suggestions
Practical Tips
For complex debugging: Pipe output into a file, then view or parse as needed.

bash
bash scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh > Logs/current_ctx_env.json
Combine with jq for structured querying:

bash
bash scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh | jq .
Pipe into other scripts for cross-language integration:

bash
bash scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh | python my_processor.py
Enhancement Suggestions
1. Full JSON Output Compliance

Ensure the output is strict JSON, not just pseudo-JSON:

Remove trailing commas,

Properly quote/escape values,

Optionally, base64-encode if needed to avoid bash/unix escaping issues.

2. Parsing and Filtering

Allow filtering for specific CTX_ keys (with args).

Usage:

bash
bash ctx_shell_helper.sh metrics user
Support exclude/include flags for output.

3. Data Transformation

Add options to decode nested JSON and pretty-print with indentation—embed jq if installed.

Support flattening simple structures for easier consumption by other tools.

4. Set or Export Back

Optionally allow setting or updating additional CTX_ variables, or re-exporting values.

5. Error Handling

Warn or abort on keys that are not valid JSON or contain suspicious shell injections.

Option to validate JSON using jq or Python.

6. Direct Push/Pull with ctx

Option to fetch ctx directly from a Python socket/REST API without the need for environment variables (advanced, see orchestrator’s HTTP push/pull patterns).

7. Wider Format Support

Output in multiple formats:

Table, CSV, YAML, etc.

Usage:

bash
bash ctx_shell_helper.sh --format csv
8. Integration Checks

Option to check which variables were expected but not found,

Can be helpful for debugging orchestrator integration problems.

9. Modularization for Chainable Shell Scripts

Have the script act as a module for other shell steps, e.g.:

bash
source scriptlets/python/core/ctx_shell_helper.sh && echo "$CTX_FOO"
10. Documentation and Help Flag

Provide usage instructions via -h or --help.

Conclusion
The ctx_shell_helper.sh script is a lightweight, portable, and essential utility for echoing and debugging the state of the orchestrator’s shared in-memory context (ctx) inside shell scriptlets.
It is invaluable for making cross-language workflows possible and forms a key foundation for shell/Python hybrid pipelines.

Implementing the suggested enhancements—especially full JSON compliance, filtering, and format support—will greatly expand its utility, debugging power, and harmonize even better with the scalable, extensible principles established for the entire automation framework.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scriptlets/python/core/ctx_set_debug.py
Objective
Purpose:
To manage, set, and propagate a unified debug mode (ctx["debug"]) for orchestrator pipelines and scriptlets.

Goal:
Allow all downstream scriptlets and steps to easily detect and act on debug mode, enabling verbose logging, extra assertions, or diagnostics wherever necessary.

Description
ctx_set_debug.py is a small, reusable core scriptlet that sets the debug flag inside the shared context (ctx). By convention, ctx["debug"] being True signals:

All steps should provide maximum verbosity.

Scriptlets and Dash apps may print more detailed information, expose intermediate state changes, or add debugging hooks.

This scriptlet acts both as a CLI utility and an orchestrator recipe step.

The scriptlet must:

Accept an explicit {"debug": True} or {"debug": False} (default: True)

Set ctx["debug"] accordingly.

Return the resulting debug state.

Requirements / Dependencies
Python 3.6+

No external dependencies (uses core types only)

Assumes orchestrator's shared ctx dictionary is in use

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
As a recipe step:
Insert as early as possible in a workflow, so all following steps may respect ctx["debug"].

As independent scriptlet:
Can be called for quick enabling/disabling of debug mode.
Example:

python
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_set_debug as ctx_set_debug
ctx_set_debug.run(ctx, {"debug": True})
Used by scriptlets:
Any scriptlet can check for ctx.get("debug") and output additional logging if enabled:

python
if ctx.get("debug"):
    print("DEBUG: ...")
Example: Recipe Step
text
- idx: 0
  name: set_debug_mode
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_set_debug
  function: run
  params:
    debug: true
Example: CLI Usage
If adapted to run from the CLI for workspace standards (for standalone debug flag setting):

python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from context import Context
    import argparse
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--debug", type=bool, default=True, help="Enable debug mode")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    ctx = Context()
    ctx_set_debug.run(ctx, {"debug": args.debug})
    print(f"Debug mode is now set to {ctx['debug']}")
Note:
As provided, ctx_set_debug.py only exposes a run(ctx, params) function—the CLI interface may need to be added if consistent with other scriptlets.

Example: Within a Custom Scriptlet
python
def run(ctx, params):
    if ctx.get("debug"):
        print(f"DEBUG: Params received: {params}")
    # ... rest of your code ...
Limitations
Does not handle logging itself—it only sets the flag for others to check.

Not persistent; if the orchestrator is restarted without saving ctx, the flag is lost.

Cannot override per-scriptlet debug logic, only sets a convention.

Requires all scriptlets and Dash apps to explicitly check for ctx["debug"] for effects to be observed.

By default, no output is generated except "debug" state in ctx.

Examples (Expanded)
Turn on debug mode at the beginning of a recipe
text
- idx: 0
  name: enable_debug_at_start
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_set_debug
  function: run
  params:
    debug: true
Turn off debug mode before a sensitive step
text
- idx: 10
  name: disable_debug_for_sensitive_ops
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_set_debug
  function: run
  params:
    debug: false
Use in test
python
def test_set_debug():
    ctx = {}
    result = ctx_set_debug.run(ctx, {"debug": True})
    assert ctx["debug"] is True
    result = ctx_set_debug.run(ctx, {"debug": False})
    assert ctx["debug"] is False
Conditional resource tracking
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_resource_monitor import resource_monitor
def run(ctx, params):
    with resource_monitor(ctx, "my_step"):
        print("Step started...")
        # Verbose debug prints
        if ctx.get("debug"):
            print("Extra debugging info!")
Recommendations and Enhancement Suggestions
CLI Wrapper:
For full compliance with workspace standards, add CLI parsing support:

Accept --debug true|false

Print the new debug state after setting.

Broadcast Debug State:
Optionally, add the ability to log or broadcast an event when debug is toggled. For example, append to ctx["events"] or ctx["log"] for traceability.

Debug Level:
Expand to support debug levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR):

Accept "debug": "DEBUG" or an integer and standardize levels.

This allows scriptlets to react to varying degrees of verbosity.

Persistence Option:
Allow saving the state of debug mode to a file, and auto-reloading if necessary.

Automatic Propagation:
When running as part of a long pipeline, propagate a "debug" context to child processes, background steps, or Dash apps (could pass via shell env or as param).

Dash Integration:
If Dash apps are running, surface the debug flag as a UI toggle (perhaps through a sidebar or navbar switch).

Fine-grained Control:
Allow debug on a per-step or per-module basis via extra params (e.g., modules: ["step1", "step2"] in params).

Unit Test Compliance:
Ensure any new feature is covered by dedicated unit tests.

Documentation Output:
Extend the scriptlet to optionally print or record current debug status in logs, for user feedback.

Error Handling:
Add error or misuse warnings when the type or value for debug is invalid.

Final Sample: Enhanced Version (with logging, events, and debug levels)
python
def run(ctx, params):
    # Accepts True/False or string/int for levels
    debug = params.get("debug", True)
    if isinstance(debug, str):
        if debug.lower() in ["false", "0", "off", "no"]:
            debug = False
        else:
            debug = True
    ctx["debug"] = debug
    # Optionally append to log/events
    if "log" not in ctx:
        ctx["log"] = []
    ctx["log"].append({"timestamp": time.time(), "event": "set_debug", "value": debug})
    return {"debug": ctx["debug"]}
References & Best Practices
Scriptlet must be independently runnable and documented

Never store non-serializable objects in ctx

All ctx changes must be traceable

Document and provide usage, limitation, and requirements

Summary:
ctx_set_debug.py is a standards-compliant, essential scriptlet for orchestrator pipelines, offering a unified debug flag for seamless, consistent, and robust pipeline debugging, and can be expanded to provide more granular and sophisticated debugging control as your workflows grow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scriptlets/python/core/ctx_scheduler.py
Objective
To provide a simple, reusable, and extensible utility for scheduling and orchestrating jobs/steps within the workflow.

Facilitate both interval-based (repeated) and point-in-time scheduled execution of functions (jobs) within the orchestrator, tracking status and results in the shared ctx.

Description
ctx_scheduler.py implements a lightweight, in-process job scheduler. It allows orchestrator recipes and Python scriptlets to:

Schedule Python callable functions to run at a specific future time (e.g., 14:30, daily).

Schedule jobs to execute every N seconds (interval scheduling).

Run multiple jobs independently, each tracked by unique job IDs.

Log start time, end time, duration, and results or errors for each scheduled job into ctx["jobs"] for downstream consumption or dashboarding.

All scheduling and status tracking operate on the in-memory context (ctx).

The scheduler is primarily designed for background data acquisition (e.g., periodic polling, ingestion) and time-triggered automation inside recipes or Dash apps.

Dependencies/Requirements
Python 3.6+ (threading improvements used)

Standard library only:

threading – for background timers

time – for timestamps and delays

datetime/timedelta – for point-in-time scheduling

No external packages are required, maximizing portability.

Applications, Integrations, Usage Scenarios
This scriptlet is a core utility for:

Periodic data fetch, polling, backup, or logging tasks.

Monitoring resource usage at intervals, and storing results in ctx for visualization.

Running a job at a particular clock time (e.g., daily report at 8 AM).

Automated workflow chains: triggering subsequent steps on a timed basis.

Integrating "cron"-like behavior natively in the orchestration flow.

Integrations:

Easily used as a step in any YAML recipe (see examples below).

Can be invoked from other scriptlets for custom recurring behavior.

Output (ctx["jobs"]) is dashboard- and report-ready.

Can be chained with event triggers, notification scriptlets, and context checkpoints.

Designed for concurrent use; each job is independent.

Limitations
Only schedules in-process Python callables—does not run CLI, shell, or external programs directly (though a Python wrapper could).

Relies on the orchestrator process remaining alive (no persistent external scheduler, e.g., cron or systemd).

For "at" scheduling, supports 24-hour time-of-day only, not arbitrary cron expressions.

No native support for retry, concurrency limit, or priority (but can be extended).

Only uses threading: unsuitable for heavy/blocking CPU jobs (use multiprocessing if needed, e.g., ctx_parallel_process.py).

Minimal error handling/logging—errors are tracked in ctx["jobs"], but not globally unless extended.

Usage
Standalone Usage as a Scriptlet in Recipes
Example recipe step:

text
- name: schedule_heartbeat
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_scheduler
  function: run
  params:
    jobs:
      - job_id: heartbeat
        fn: my_heartbeat_function     # Python callable (must be imported)
        args:
          msg: "still alive"
        interval: 60                  # Every 60 seconds
      - job_id: noon_report
        fn: send_report
        args:
          report_key: "daily_stats"
        at: "12:00"                  # Once per day at noon
Note: For recipe integration, functions must be importable in context or wrapped as scriptlet-compatible functions.

Example: Interval Job
python
def ping():
    print("Ping at", time.strftime("%H:%M:%S"))
    return "ok"

ctx = {}
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_scheduler
ctx_scheduler.run(ctx, {
    "jobs": [
        {"job_id": "ping", "fn": ping, "interval": 5}
    ]
})
# Schedules 'ping' to run every 5 seconds. Progress can be monitored in ctx['jobs']['ping'].
Example: Time-of-Day Scheduling
python
def collect_daily_metrics():
    # Extract & summarize as needed
    return {"summary": "Data as of " + time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}

ctx_scheduler.run(ctx, {
    "jobs": [
        {
            "job_id": "midnight_metrics",
            "fn": collect_daily_metrics,
            "at": "00:00"
        }
    ]
})
# Will run function once at midnight (local time).
Advanced Example: Multiple Jobs
python
def job_one():
    print("Run job one")
    return 1

def job_two(x):
    print("Run job two with x =", x)
    return x * 2

ctx_scheduler.run(ctx, {
    "jobs": [
        {"job_id": "one", "fn": job_one, "interval": 60},
        {"job_id": "two", "fn": job_two, "interval": 15, "args": {"x": 22}},
        {"job_id": "once_at", "fn": job_one, "at": "15:30"}
    ]
})
Dashboard Integration Example
After running scheduled jobs, ctx["jobs"] will contain, for each job:

python
{
  "status": "done" or "running" or "error",
  "result": ...,
  "start": <timestamp>,
  "end": <timestamp>,
  "error": <str, if failed>
}
This enables job progress and result reporting in Dash, logs, or audits.

API Reference
run(ctx, params)
params:

jobs: list of dict, one entry per job, each with:

job_id: unique identifier string (required)

fn: Python callable/function (not a string; must be accessible in interpreter, or wrapped in a scriptlet)

args: dict, arguments to pass to fn (default: {})

One of:

interval: seconds between calls (for recurring jobs)

at: "HH:MM" 24-hour time string (for run-once jobs)

returns: dict listing scheduled job IDs

Recommendations, Tips & Expansion Suggestions
General Tips
For jobs that involve non-trivial computation, ensure that the scheduled function is as lightweight as possible if running in a thread; offload to process/pool if needed.

For persistent, across-reboot cron-like behavior, consider also emitting configuration for cron/systemd or integrating with an external job queue.

Feature Expansion Suggestions
Scriptlet/Recipe Integration:

Add the ability to accept the function reference as a string (e.g., import path or scriptlet name), resolving via a registry or importlib, to support YAML-driven jobs fully.

Flexible Time Expressions:

Support extended schedule syntax (cron-style: "*/5 * * * *", intervals in minutes, ISO8601 durations, day-of-week).

Job Lifecycle Hooks:

Allow on_success, on_failure, or trigger downstream steps/events based on job results.

Retry, Backoff & Concurrency:

Add retry counts, exponential backoff on error, and limit concurrent job threading.

Distributed/Process Pool Option:

For CPU-heavy work, provide option to run in a multiprocessing pool or delegate to scriptlets.python.core.ctx_parallel_process.

Persistence:

Serialize queue or history to Data/ for audit and for restoring job state after orchestrator restarts.

Job Audit & Logging:

Integrate with auditing utility (e.g., ctx_step_audit, ctx_logger) for full step/job traceability.

Job Removal/Suspension:

API to allow pausing or canceling jobs already scheduled.

Notifying on Event:

Integrate with notification scriptlet (ctx_notify_advanced.py) to send Slack/email on job completion/error.

UI/Query Support:

Dashboard components (tabs, tables) to monitor, start, stop jobs, or display next scheduled run times.

Example: Advanced Recipe for Periodic and One-time Tasks
text
- name: schedule_all_tasks
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_scheduler
  function: run
  params:
    jobs:
      - job_id: fast_task
        fn: fast_fn
        interval: 10
      - job_id: morning_summary
        fn: make_summary
        at: "09:00"
      - job_id: one_time
        fn: once_fn
        at: "15:30"
(with additional job registry/import support)

Conclusion
ctx_scheduler.py is designed as a composable, lightweight, framework-native scheduler supporting all automation, orchestration, and monitoring tasks that require periodic and scheduled triggering.
Extending it to accept import paths for job functions and supporting persistent job configuration/state will future-proof and more deeply integrate it with your orchestrator’s declarative, recipe-driven, modular architecture.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_rollback.py - Documentation and Analysis
Objective
The primary objective of ctx_rollback.py is to restore the shared in-memory context (ctx) to a previous, known-good state from a snapshot file in the event of errors. This ensures that after workflow failures or invalid mutations, automation steps can be retried or continued from a valid, consistent point without requiring a full manual reset or recreation of earlier results.

Description
ctx_rollback.py is a Python scriptlet designed to enable robust error recovery for orchestrator pipelines.

It accepts a snapshot parameter, which is the path to a JSON file containing a prior dump of the entire ctx (e.g., as produced by ctx_snapshot.py or similar).

If any error condition is detected (typically by inspecting a ctx key—by default errors), ctx_rollback.py overwrites all keys in the current ctx with the data loaded from the snapshot file, effectively reverting ctx to the saved state.

This is meant for atomic restoration to a rollback point, thus enabling recipes and pipelines to resume cleanly after failure.

python
import json

def run(ctx, params):
    snapshot = params["snapshot"]
    errors_key = params.get("errors_key", "errors")
    if ctx.get(errors_key):
        with open(snapshot) as f:
            snap = json.load(f)
        ctx.clear()
        ctx.update(snap)
        return {"rolled_back": True}
    return {"rolled_back": False}
Dependencies
Python Standard Library

json (for reading/writing ctx snapshot files as JSON)

The orchestrator’s Context class implementation (must behave as a writable dict)

No third-party or external dependencies

Applications & Integrations
Automated Recovery: Integrate as a step in orchestrator recipes to automatically revert ctx after detected failures (e.g., after model or pipeline steps producing erroneous or incomplete results).

Branch/Retry Handling: Use as a precondition step ahead of retry logic (see ctx_step_retry.py) to guarantee a "clean" context before attempting re-execution.

Audit and Resume: Paired with ctx_snapshot.py, this scriptlet enables "checkpointing" of execution, audit trails, and makes long-running and interactive pipelines more robust.

Manual/Machine Recovery: Can be called directly via API/CLI tooling when debugging or manually debugging pipeline failures.

Limitations
Only works with JSON-serializable ctx (matches workspace rules!).

Cannot rollback partial subsets of ctx; restores the entire ctx state.

The success of rollback depends on the availability and integrity of the snapshot JSON file.

Only rolls back if ctx[errors_key] exists and is truthy (non-empty, e.g., non-empty list/dict/string/flag).

Does not create the snapshot itself—it relies on ctx_snapshot.py or equivalent to provide the reference file.

No built-in support for versioning, multi-way branching, or selective key merges.

No hooks/callbacks for post-rollback alerting or audit (these can/should be added).

Usage
Orchestrator Recipe Example
Rollback after error in prior steps:

text
- name: rollback_if_needed
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_rollback
  function: run
  params:
    snapshot: "Data/ctx_snapshot_20250825.json"
    errors_key: "errors"
This will restore ctx to the contents of Data/ctx_snapshot_20250825.json if the errors key is non-empty.

Example: CLI or Inline Code
Python API:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_rollback

ctx = {"some_data": [1, 2, 3], "errors": ["Something failed!"]}
result = ctx_rollback.run(ctx, {
    "snapshot": "Data/ctx_snapshot_20250825.json",  # previously created by ctx_snapshot
    "errors_key": "errors"
})
# Now ctx will be restored to snapshot content if ctx["errors"] existed and was truthy
print(result)  # {'rolled_back': True} or {'rolled_back': False}
In CI/CLI automation:

text
python -c "
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_rollback;
ctx = ... # load or define context
params = {'snapshot': 'Data/ctx_snap.json', 'errors_key': 'errors'}
ctx_rollback.run(ctx, params)
"

Recommendations for Expansion and Feature Enhancement
1. Multiple Checkpoints/Named Snapshots
Add support for referencing multiple checkpoints (e.g., by name, timestamp, or context).

Allow restoring by name or latest checkpoint rather than explicit path.

Integration with ctx_checkpoint.py.

2. Selective/Partial Rollback
Enable rollback or merge at the key level:

Only restore certain ctx keys (e.g., data keys but not meta).

Support for specifying a list of keys to rollback or exclude.

3. Automatic Snapshot Creation
Optionally create a new snapshot "before" rollback and "after" rollback to fully audit changes and allow chained undos.

Store a "pre-rollback" reference for recovery debugging.

4. Integration With Step Audit/Logging
Emit an explicit event or append an entry to ctx["audit"], ctx["trace"] or logs when a rollback occurs.

Include information about what triggered the rollback and what was restored.

5. Callback or Notification Support
Allow supplying a callback/hook to notify via email/slack, or call a notification step if rollback is triggered.

Integration with ctx_notify.py and ctx_notify_advanced.py.

6. Versioned Snapshots
Support keeping several snapshot histories and rolling back N steps (using a stack or ring buffer).

Integration with a checkpoint manager.

7. Error Handling/Exceptions
Optional: Add richer error handling/reporting, including re-raising after rollback, or safely suppressing further execution.

8. Resume/Continue Option
On rollback, optionally skip to a "safe step" or allow for recipe resumption from the restored context.

Best Practices & Tips
Always validate the target snapshot file and its compatibility with current ctx layout before restoring.

Take snapshots frequently: after major milestones, data ingestion, or before risky/mutable operations.

Use in tandem with context auditing tools to maintain complete reproducibility and traceability.

Document and log every rollback for debugging and compliance—don’t silently overwrite ctx!

Favor atomic, JSON-serializable ctx objects and maintain deterministic restoration for reliable automation.

Pair use of ctx_rollback.py with robust error detection and consistent error key conventions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_restore.py — Documentation for Orchestrator Workspace
Objective
Restore the shared in-memory context (ctx) from a previously saved snapshot file (JSON format).

Enable full, auditable rollback of workflow state in case of interruption, error, or for resuming/replaying executions.

Ensure continuity, reproducibility, and debuggability for all orchestrated automation work.

Description
ctx_restore.py is a core utility scriptlet for loading a previously dumped ctx (serialized as a JSON file) back into the orchestrator’s step context.

It overwrites the current in-memory ctx with the contents of the given snapshot, enabling precise rollback, auditing, or branching from any prior pipeline state.

Designed for plug-and-play usage in recipes and as a standalone CLI tool.

Critical for debugging, rapid development, disaster recovery, workflow forking, and reproducible research.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+

Standard library:

json (for parsing and loading JSON ctx files)

No external dependencies required.

Assumes snapshot file is accessible and valid JSON (as created, for example, by ctx_snapshot.py or the orchestrator’s own state-dump).

Applications & Integration
Disaster Recovery: Instantly recover from failed or interrupted workflows by restoring ctx from the last valid state file.

Experiment Reproducibility: Roll back and rerun sections of a workflow under identical conditions.

Live Debugging: Switch context to a historic state to investigate bugs or variations in pipeline behavior.

CI/CD and Automated Testing: Set up integration tests that start pipelines from a known ctx configuration.

Recipe Authoring: Insert as a step at any point to initialize context to pre-defined content for demonstration or teaching.

from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_restore
ctx = {}
ctx_restore.run(ctx, {"file": "Data/backup_ctx.json"})
Limitations
Overwrites the entire active ctx — any unsaved changes will be lost.

Assumes input file is a valid JSON serialization of a dict; will raise if file is corrupt or improperly formatted.

No partial merges — cannot restore only specific keys; it’s all or nothing.

Does not check type integrity beyond what is in the file.

Does not support versioning or schema validation out of the box.

Single-process only: If used in concurrent/multi-process environments, race conditions are possible unless externally locked.

Will not restore non-serializable objects or executable state (e.g., threads, open file handles, etc.).

Does not manage backups of the current ctx before restore — must be done by user/recipe separately if needed.

Usage Examples
Typical Restore Within a Recipe
text
steps:
  - idx: 1
    name: restore_from_previous
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_restore
    function: run
    params:
      file: "Data/ctx_snapshot_20250825_001.json"
This will replace the working ctx with what was previously saved in the snapshot file.

Immediate Restore via Python API
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_restore

ctx = {}  # The context you want to restore into
result = ctx_restore.run(ctx, {"file": "Data/demo_ctx.json"})
print("Restored keys:", list(ctx.keys()))  # Shows all ctx after restore
Recipe: Branching Workflows
You can restore at mid-recipe to create parallel experiments:

text
- idx: 4
  name: restore_for_branch
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_restore
  function: run
  params:
    file: "Data/checkpoint_branch_1.json"
- idx: 5
  name: run_scenario_a
  type: python
  # ... continue downstream processing for scenario A ...
- idx: 6
  name: restore_for_branch_2
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_restore
  function: run
  params:
    file: "Data/checkpoint_branch_2.json"
- idx: 7
  name: run_scenario_b
  type: python
  # ... continue alternative processing for scenario B ...
Combined with ctx_snapshot for Robust Iteration
text
- name: checkpoint_before_transformation
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_snapshot
  function: run
  params:
    out: "Data/pre_transform.json"

- name: heavy_transformation
  # ... transformation step ...

- name: rollback_if_failed
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_restore
  function: run
  params:
    file: "Data/pre_transform.json"
Allows return to safe state if downstream steps fail or results are undesirable.

CLI Usage / Quick Check
text
python -c "import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_restore as cr; ctx={}; cr.run(ctx, {'file':'Data/ctx_test.json'}); print(ctx)"
Direct CLI interact for exploratory/debug purposes.

Recommendations & Suggestions for Future Enhancement
1. Partial Key Restore:

Allow restoring only selected keys from the file, enabling merging instead of whole-replacement.

Suggest new param: keys: [k1, k2, ...]

Example:

python
ctx_restore.run(ctx, {"file": "Data/backup.json", "keys": ["foo", "bar"]})
2. Backup Current ctx Pre-restore:

Optionally auto-backup the existing ctx before overwrite if a param is set (e.g., backup_path). This would simplify rollback-on-rollback and debugging.

3. Schema or Version Validation:

Add optional schema/version check (compatible with ctx_validate_schema.py) before restoring to prevent mismatches or incompatibilities.

Example param: schema: {...} or require_version: "v1.0"

4. Restore with Deep Merge:

Allow merging loaded ctx snapshot into the existing ctx, optionally controlling overwrite for each key.

5. Logging & Traceability:

Automatically log every restore event into ctx["trace"] or similar, recording timestamp, user, snapshot file, keys affected.

6. Cross-Process Safety:

Integrate with ctx_file_lock.py for atomic or synchronized restores in multi-process environments.

7. Error Handling Hooks:

Allow specifying an error-handler or callback for custom error policies if file is missing, badly formatted, or restore fails.

8. CLI Tool with Validations:

Provide a CLI entry for this scriptlet with enhanced feedback:

text
python scriptlets/python/core/ctx_restore.py --file Data/backup.json --validate-schema schema.json --backup-old Data/old_ctx_autoback.json
9. Snapshot History:

Maintain an index of past snapshots/restores in a hidden ctx key for auditability, possibly even allowing “undo” of restores.

Tips for Best Use (Following Framework Best Practices)
Always backup current ctx if there’s risk of losing unsaved work.

Use restore only after careful review, as all unsaved context will be lost.

Try to combine with snapshotting and audit-log steps for maximal traceability.

Keep snapshot and restore steps small, atomic, and well-commented in recipes for clear workflow documentation.

When possible, use together with ctx_validate or ctx_validate_schema to check ctx structure directly after restore.

Avoid restoring during time-critical background updates unless properly synchronized.

Never store non-serializable objects in ctx or expect them to be restored.

Integrate as a first step in tests or data science/AI experiments for complete reproducibility from checkpoints.

Summary:
ctx_restore.py is a critical building block for robust, resilient, and reproducible orchestrator automation, enabling workflows to be repeated, branched, debugged, or resumed under exact original conditions.
Recommended enhancements are technically feasible and fit naturally within your orchestrator framework’s modular, extensible philosophy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation: ctx_resource_monitor.py
Objective
The primary goal of ctx_resource_monitor.py is to monitor and log system resource usage (CPU and memory) during the execution of orchestrator workflow steps or callbacks. This enables users and developers to understand the performance characteristics of individual steps within a workflow, detect bottlenecks, and ensure efficient utilization of computing resources. All results are stored in the shared in-memory context (ctx) for traceability and later analysis.

Description
What it does:
ctx_resource_monitor.py provides a reusable context manager, resource_monitor, that, when used to wrap a code block or orchestration step, automatically records:

The start and end time of the step.

The amount of CPU and RAM (memory) used before and after execution.

The wall-clock duration of the code wrapped.

Where the data goes:
It appends an entry per use to ctx["resources"] (a list), following this format:

python
{
    "step": step_name,
    "start": <start_time_in_seconds>,
    "end": <end_time_in_seconds>,
    "duration": <duration_in_seconds>,
    "cpu_start": <cpu_percent_before>,
    "cpu_end": <cpu_percent_after>,
    "mem_start": <rss_in_bytes_before>,
    "mem_end": <rss_in_bytes_after>
}
Requirements / Dependencies
Python 3.6+

psutil (for CPU/memory monitoring)

time (standard library, for timestamps)

contextlib (standard library, for context manager)

Install requirements:

text
pip install psutil
Applications, Integrations, and Usage
Applications:
Per-step monitoring:
Used in orchestrator recipes to track memory/CPU use for each step.

Performance diagnostics:
Helps identify bottlenecks in multi-step workflows.

Dashboarding:
Data in ctx["resources"] can be visualized in Dash apps for real-time system health.

Auditing:
Provides historical resource usage for compliance, reporting, or optimization studies.

Integration Example
1. Wrapping an Orchestrator Step
In a scriptlet or core step, simply use the context manager to measure an operation:

python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_resource_monitor import resource_monitor

def run(ctx, params):
    step_name = params.get("step", "my_step")
    with resource_monitor(ctx, step_name):
        # Your step computation here
        my_result = my_expensive_function()
    ctx["result"] = my_result
    return {"status": "ok"}
2. Measuring Resource Usage in a Custom Workflow
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_resource_monitor import resource_monitor

# Suppose ctx is shared
with resource_monitor(ctx, "data_cleaning"):
    cleaned = clean_data(ctx["raw_data"])
ctx["cleaned_data"] = cleaned
3. Recipe File Integration (YAML Snippet)
If building a standard step function, simply ensure it wraps its logic:

text
- name: analyze_performance
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.my_analysis_step
  function: run
  params:
    step: "analysis"
Inside my_analysis_step.py:

python
def run(ctx, params):
    with resource_monitor(ctx, params["step"]):
        # analysis logic
        pass
4. Accessing Collected Resource Data
After your recipe runs (in the orchestrator), resource logs can be inspected:

python
import json
with open('Logs/ctx_debug.log') as f:
    print(f.read())
# Or directly:
print(ctx["resources"])
5. Viewing in Dash
Visualize per-step resource logs in dashboards, for example, a line chart of memory used per step.

Limitations
Scope:
Tracks only the main Python process running the monitored block.
If the step spawns subprocesses or extensive background threads, extra monitoring is needed.

Granularity:
Will not provide per-line or sub-step resource use, only the range bracketing the context.

Accuracy of CPU measurement:
psutil.Process().cpu_percent() requires careful handling for precise deltas; short steps may show 0%.

OS compatibility:
Requires psutil to support the operating system. Notably robust on Linux/Mac/Windows.

Detailed Usage Examples
A) Basic: Timing and Monitoring any Python Code
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_resource_monitor import resource_monitor

def run(ctx, params):
    with resource_monitor(ctx, "step1"):
        for _ in range(10**7):
            pass
    return ctx["resources"][-1]
Expected ctx["resources"] result:

python
[{
  "step": "step1",
  "start": 1693000000.0,
  "end": 1693000000.12,
  "duration": 0.12,
  "cpu_start": 0.0,
  "cpu_end": 10.5,
  "mem_start": 25272320,
  "mem_end": 25309184
}]
B) Multiple Step Usage in Recipes
python
# Example orchestrator recipe fragment, each code block monitors itself:
- name: preprocess
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.preprocess
  function: run
- name: analyze
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.steps.analyze
  function: run
For each step, wrap with resource_monitor(ctx, step_name), e.g.:

python
def run(ctx, params):
    with resource_monitor(ctx, "analyze"):
        # analysis logic here
        pass
C) Aggregating Resource Logs for a Whole Pipeline
In post-processing or reporting:

python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(ctx["resources"])
print(df)
Visualize or export step-wise memory and CPU profiles.

Recommendations & Enhancement Tips
1. Add Support for Disk Usage Monitoring

Track shutil.disk_usage(".") at start/end for disk space used, and log I/O activity.

Add new fields: "disk_start", "disk_end", "disk_delta".

2. Add Child Process Tracking

Aggregate CPU and memory for all child PIDs (if subprocesses are spawned).

3. Granular Timing

Allow for multiple nested or uniquely named monitors in a single step (e.g., "step": "step2:load_data").

Record peak RSS memory during block, using psutil.Process().memory_info().rss in a polling thread.

4. Integration with Logging Utilities

Automatically append resource events to ctx["log"] as well, for consistent reporting.

Include resource stats in step audit entries.

5. Improved CPU Measurement

Use a more reliable CPU % sampling for short blocks, such as sampling before/after over a window.

Optionally poll CPU usage mid-block for long-running steps.

6. Optional Alerts

Add threshold capability: issue a warning or raise an event/alert in ctx["events"] if memory/CPU exceeds preset limits.

7. Make Resource Monitor a Decorator Too

Provide a functional decorator for ease of use in step functions:

python
@resource_monitor_decorator(ctx, "step_name")
def my_step():
    pass
8. Add Per-Thread and Per-Process Stats

In advanced workflows, track resources per thread (optional argument).

9. Documentation Generation

Embed examples and usage in docstrings for auto-generated documentation.

10. UI/Dashboard Integration

Supply helper endpoints to push resource summaries to Dash/Plotly displays with minimal effort.

General Tips:
Keep all ctx entries JSON-serializable.

Store resources in a consistent structure for easy reporting.

Reference resource entries in per-step logs for traceability.

Ensure all monitoring is non-blocking and does not excessively impact step run time.

Regularly audit and clear ctx["resources"] to avoid unbounded memory growth in very long workflows.

Summary:
ctx_resource_monitor.py is a lightweight but powerful resource tracker for the orchestrator framework, crucial for production, optimization, and debugging. With small, standards-compliant enhancements, it can be a foundation for advanced observability in your automation pipelines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_report_template.py — Documentation
Objective
ctx_report_template.py is designed to generate a human-readable report by filling a text template (Markdown or Word) with values extracted from the shared in-memory context (ctx).
This scriptlet enables dynamic, automated report creation using context data, supporting both inline and external variables, and is intended for integration into automated pipelines that require post-analysis summaries, audits, or user-facing documentation.

Description
The scriptlet reads a template file (typically Markdown or .docx), performs variable substitution from ctx and/or an explicit variables dictionary, and writes the result to an output file. This bridges your automated pipeline's data/results and human-readable documentation.

Key Features
Template Loading: Reads a text template (supports Markdown or plaintext; .docx expansion is possible with mailmerge).

Variable Injection: Accepts an explicit dictionary of substitution variables (vars). Any value starting with "ctx:" is replaced by the corresponding value in ctx.

Safe Context Expansion: Only data you explicitly specify (via the "vars" mapping and "ctx:<key>" indirection) is injected; this prevents accidental leaking of large or sensitive objects.

Output Writing: The filled template is saved as a new file (path is configurable).

Reusable in Recipe Pipelines: Conforms to the orchestrator's scriptlet design pattern:
run(ctx, params) returns {"written": <outputfile>}.

Dependencies
Python: 3.6+

Standard Library: No external dependencies are required for Markdown/text templates.

For future .docx (Word) or other advanced templates, see Tips below.

Uses only open() and basic string formatting.

Applications & Integrations
Typical Use Cases
Auto-generated audit, summary, or analysis reports at the end of your workflow.

Creating Markdown/Word documentation for each test run, including statistics, metrics, plots, or user notes.

Merging dynamic structured data with human-written textual explanations.

Integration in Recipes
Add as the last (or penultimate) step in your recipe to produce a final report.

Can be chained with other analysis or summary scriptlets for data gathering.

Limitations
Only supports plain text and Markdown templates using Python string .format(...) syntax by default.

Does not support advanced templating (loops, conditionals), see Tips for expansion.

Reliance on "vars": each variable must be named explicitly in "vars"; there is no automatic recursive ctx-to-template mapping.

Cannot directly convert dataframes, lists, dicts to pretty tables or rich content unless serialized manually.

No built-in context/history logging in the output; you must add fields deliberately.

No error handling for missing template variables: a KeyError will break execution unless guarded outside.

Example Usage
Sample Template: templates/my_report.md
text
# Test Report: {test_id}

- Tester: {tester}
- Description: {description}
- Results: {result}
- Metric Value: {metric}

Thank you!
Recipe Step Example
text
- name: generate_markdown_report
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_report_template
  function: run
  params:
    template: templates/my_report.md
    out: Data/report_20250825.md
    vars:
      test_id: "ctx:test_id"
      tester: "ctx:tester"
      description: "ctx:description"
      result: "ctx:ai_summary"
      metric: "ctx:my_metric"
Explanation:

The variables inside curly braces in the template should match those provided in the vars mapping.

Any variable with the string prefix ctx: (e.g., ctx:ai_summary) is replaced by the corresponding key in ctx.

Expanded Example:
Suppose your pipeline populates ctx like this:

python
ctx = {
    "test_id": "demo001",
    "tester": "user",
    "description": "Testing automation.",
    "ai_summary": "Success! All tests passed.",
    "my_metric": 42
}
and your template:

text
# Summary for {test_id}
Conducted by: {tester}
...
Summary: {result}
Key metric: {metric}
It will generate a file with those fields replaced.

Direct CLI Example
If you expose the scriptlet as a CLI program:

bash
python ctx_report_template.py --template templates/my_report.md --out Data/report.md --vars '{"foo": "bar", "result": "ctx:ai_summary"}'
# (Supporting CLI args would require a custom __main__ guard and parsing.)
Recommendations and Tips for Enhancement
General Tips
Validate Data: Always pre-validate that your vars map contains all required keys for the template, and that referenced ctx entries are present.

Keep Templates Versioned: Store template files in a templates/ folder, versioned as part of your repo.

Use for Audit and Traceability: For best traceability, consider including step and context traces in your report (ctx["trace"], ctx["audit"]).

Enhancement Suggestions (Framework-Compliant)
Jinja2 Support for Advanced Templating:

Add support for Jinja2 templates to enable loops/conditionals/filters:

Example:

python
from jinja2 import Template
...
rendered = Template(template_string).render(**vars)
This will allow table-style rendering, iterative sections, conditionals, etc.

Native Word (docx) Report Generation:

Use python-docx or mailmerge for more complex, styled documents.

Could add an if template.endswith('.docx'): clause to use docx-specific merging.

Automatic Variable Expansion:

Optionally allow using the entire ctx as a variable source, with safeguards.

e.g., template.format(**ctx), but provide a variable whitelist for safety.

Custom Formatting Filters:

Add support for formatting functions, e.g., for date/time, numbers, etc., or pre-process vars before substitution.

Integrated Error Handling:

Catch and report missing variable keys and incompatible types.

Optionally allow {var|default} or similar fallback syntax.

In-Report Step Log or Table:

Add a utility to format and inject audit logs, traces, or stats tables from ctx, possibly with a {table:...} macro.

CLI Entrypoint:

Add a __main__ section to allow direct CLI invocation for debugging/use outside recipe runner.

Output Format Validation:

Add optional check/validation for the output file (successful substitution, no unresolved fields).

Export as PDF:

Add a step to convert Markdown (or a rendered HTML) to PDF using pandoc or a Python PDF package.

Integration with Notification:

Automatically notify/E-mail the report file using a downstream scriptlet in the workflow after report generation.

Summary
ctx_report_template.py is a core building block for report templating in your orchestrator—enabling dynamic, context-driven document generation.
It is lightweight, composable, and can be chained in workflows as prescribed by your documentation standards. Its extensibility is high: by gradually layering in more sophisticated template and data handling, it can become the reporting backbone of your automation pipelines, supporting both end-users and auditors.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for ctx_push_pull.py
Overview
Objective
Provide a simple, reusable mechanism to push and pull data between the orchestrator’s shared in-memory context (ctx) and a remote HTTP endpoint, enabling orchestrator workflows to integrate with cloud services, dashboards, and external processes using REST APIs.

Enable steps in orchestrator pipelines to synchronize, share, and retrieve live data between distributed systems without breaking the JSON-serializable contract.

Support both push (send ctx data to remote API) and pull (fetch data from remote API into ctx) in a manner that can be called as a scriptlet step or from CLI.

Description
The scriptlet defines a function:

python
def run(ctx, params):
    url = params["url"]
    key = params["key"]
    if params["action"] == "push":
        resp = requests.post(url, json={key: ctx[key]})
        return {"status": resp.status_code}
    elif params["action"] == "pull":
        resp = requests.get(url)
        ctx[key] = resp.json()[key]
        return {"pulled": key}
    else:
        return {"status": "noop"}
Action Modes:

"push": Serializes and posts a ctx key’s value as JSON to an HTTP endpoint.

"pull": Fetches JSON from the endpoint, storing resp.json()[key] under the same key in ctx.

All data must be JSON-serializable, preserving the fundamental ctx safety guarantee.

Requirements/Dependencies
Python 3.6+ (for f-strings and standard library)

requests package (HTTP client)

Install via: pip install requests

A server that can accept and return JSON payloads matching the ctx key structure.

Applications & Integration
Inter-process/remote orchestration: Send results to or fetch parameters/metrics from a remote orchestrator, microservice, or dashboard.

Automation trigger: Notify a webhook when a stage completes or collect data pushed by another system.

Multi-agent workflows: Let one orchestrator instance push data that another, running elsewhere (e.g., in a different pipeline or cloud VM), can pull.

Live dashboard integration: Push processed ctx metrics to a dashboard service or pull latest config from a remote source.

Recovery and resume flows: Pull latest known state from a remote endpoint during orchestrator startup.

Example integration in a recipe step:

text
- name: push_metrics_to_server
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_push_pull
  function: run
  params:
    action: push
    url: "http://my-server.example.com/api/metrics"
    key: metrics_summary

- name: get_latest_ai_report
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_push_pull
  function: run
  params:
    action: pull
    url: "http://my-server.example.com/api/ai_report"
    key: ai_summary
Usage and Detailed Examples
As an Orchestrator Step
Recipe push example:

text
- name: push_myresult
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_push_pull
  function: run
  params:
    action: push
    url: "http://api.example.com/post_ctx"
    key: my_data
What happens:

The value of ctx['my_data'] is POSTed as { "my_data": ... } to the given URL.

Server response code is stored in the step return.

Recipe pull example:

text
- name: pull_freshdata
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_push_pull
  function: run
  params:
    action: pull
    url: "http://api.example.com/latest"
    key: model_input
What happens:

GET request to URL.

Expects a JSON body with "model_input": ....

Stores that value in ctx['model_input'].

As a Standalone Scriptlet/CLI
Python:

python
import requests
ctx = {"foo": [1,2,3]}
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_push_pull import run
run(ctx, {"action": "push", "url": "http://localhost:5000/put", "key": "foo"})
run(ctx, {"action": "pull", "url": "http://localhost:5000/get", "key": "bar"})
print(ctx)
Detailed Workflow Patterns
Bidirectional Sync
Push newly computed results after each step.

Pull at the beginning of the workflow for resume or latest state.

Combine with ctx_snapshot/restore for checkpointed recovery.

Chained Orchestrator Agents
Machine A pushes logs or status as ctx key to a cloud endpoint.

Machine B in another site or cloud region pulls that ctx key and continues processing.

Live Dashboard/Analytics Push
After metric computation, push to a /metrics endpoint which auto-feeds a dashboard.

Webhook/Event Ingestion
Orchestrator runs an HTTP server exposing /events, and other workflow instances push results or triggers into it.

Limitations
No authentication: Does not handle HTTP auth, API keys, or headers natively.

No batching: Single-key per operation; multi-key push must be scripted in recipe as multiple steps.

No error handling for missing keys: Expects ctx[key] to exist for push and for pull result to include [key].

No retry/backoff: A failed HTTP request is not retried; errors propagate directly.

No data transformation: Only raw JSON serialization/deserialization; no schema adaption.

Assumes endpoint contract: Server must accept/return JSON with expected structure.

Blocking: Step blocks until request completes; pulling large payloads may delay pipelines.

Recommendations, Tips, and Suggestions for Enhancement
1. Auth and Headers

Add support for headers in params or fetch from ctx for OAuth, tokens, or custom APIs.

Example:

text
params:
  action: push
  url: "http://my-api/secure"
  key: result
  headers:
    Authorization: "Bearer {token}"
2. Error Handling and Robustness

Catch HTTP/server errors and return detailed error messages and status (404, 500, timeout, etc.).

Add config for retries and exponential backoff for improved resilience.

3. Multi-Key Bulk Push/Pull

Allow {keys: [...], mode: all/any} or data param to synchronize several ctx entries at once.

4. Data Transformation/Schema Mapping

Allow specifying a mapping or transform (e.g., flatten nested dicts or convert snake_case to camelCase).

Example:

text
params:
  action: push
  url: "..."
  key: result
  transform_fn: my_scriptlet.transform_for_api
5. Async/Background Operation

Support background: true for non-blocking HTTP transfers, using thread or async IO.

6. Support for Other HTTP Methods

Extend to supporting PUT, PATCH, DELETE for more complex REST APIs.

7. Logging/Debug Hooks

Log all outbound/inbound payloads (perhaps when ctx["debug"]=True) for auditing and traceability.

8. CLI/Standalone Improvements

Add argparse CLI, so the scriptlet can be used as a command line utility for emergency/manual debug integration.

9. Integration with Event Bus

After a successful push or pull, emit a ctx event (see your ctx_event_bus.py) so Dash dashboards and other scriptlets can react.

10. Exception Handling for Missing ctx Key

Return a custom error if ctx[key] is missing (for push).

11. Schema Validation on Pull

Validate or coerce type of pulled data to match expected ctx structure, logging any mismatch.

Best Practices for ctx Integration
Initialize all ctx keys you intend to push/pull using ctx_init.py to avoid uninitialized key errors.

Document all HTTP endpoints and their expected JSON structure for both orchestrator recipe authors and backend developers.

Log all push/pull operations in ctx["log"] for traceability.

Always check return values/step output for status and error messages and consider adding success gating in recipes for robust gating.

Example: Adding to a Recipe With Error Logging

- name: push_step_output
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_push_pull
  function: run

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_pubsub.py
Objective
Provide a simple, in-memory, pub/sub (publish/subscribe) mechanism using the shared ctx object, enabling event-driven automation and reactive interactions in orchestrator workflows.
Its design supports modular trigger-actions, where changes or events can be published to ctx, and subscribers can react (e.g., in Dash dashboards or scriptlets).

Description
Implements a basic event publication and subscription pattern via the orchestrator's shared context (ctx).

When an event is published (with an optional payload), it gets appended as a dict to ctx["events"].

A scriptlet or Dash callback can subscribe to a specific event type, fetch and remove those events from ctx["events"], and act accordingly.

This mechanism enables decoupled, reactive pipelines—steps or the UI can trigger actions in response to other steps’ outputs, errors, or user actions.

Dependencies
Python version: 3.6+ (uses only standard Python dictionaries/objects)

No external libraries required.

Relies on orchestrator’s in-memory ctx infrastructure, which must be available in the scriptlet execution environment.

For advanced use, integrates well with Dash callbacks for real-time UI updates.

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
Applications:

Dash callback triggers: Notify dashboard components when data has changed and needs replotting.

Orchestrator workflow: Let one scriptlet or step trigger follow-up steps without direct dependencies.

Error, notification, or toast alerts in UI: e.g., display a notification in Dash when an event is published.

Batch/accumulate events for auditing or logging.

Trigger cross-scriptlet logic (e.g., start long-running computation in another thread/process).

Integrations:

Easily referenceable in recipes or other scriptlets (just import and call run).

Can be used by both Python and shell steps (when exported to shell via ctx).

Works out of the box as part of orchestrator’s shared memory model.

Dash apps or UI can poll or react to ctx["events"].

Limitations
In-memory only: Not persistent across restarts, no distributed message bus—limited to a single orchestrator process and context.

Single-process access: Not designed for cross-process or distributed use (see Recommendations for scaling out).

Basic event matching: Subscriptions filter only by event type (event field in event dict), no advanced filtering or pattern matching.

No timeouts, retries, or at-least-once delivery guarantees.

Events are removed from the event list when fetched by a subscriber.
(If multiple subscribers need to see every event, you must implement your own copy or audit system.)

Usage
1. Import and Basic Structure
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_pubsub import run

# Example ctx structure
ctx = {}
2. Publish an Event
python
# Publish a "data_updated" event with additional information (payload)
run(ctx, {"event": "data_updated", "payload": {"source": "step1", "details": "Metrics recalculated"}})
# ctx["events"] now contains one event dict
3. Subscribe to an Event
python
# Subscribe to all "data_updated" events (will return and remove them from ctx)
subs = run(ctx, {"subscribe": "data_updated"})
print(subs)  # {'events': [{...}]}
4. Multiple Events
python
# Publish more than one event
run(ctx, {"event": "job_failed", "payload": {"step": "analyze", "error": "File not found"}})
run(ctx, {"event": "data_ready", "payload": {"file": "output.csv"}})

# Subscribe to different types
failures = run(ctx, {"subscribe": "job_failed"})
ready = run(ctx, {"subscribe": "data_ready"})
5. Dash UI Example (Pseudo-Pattern)
In your Dash app:

python
import dash
# ... dash app layout ...

# Inside Dash callback
def poll_events():
    evdata = run(ctx, {"subscribe": "data_ready"})
    if evdata["events"]:
        # Do something with downloaded/processed file
        print("Files ready:", evdata["events"])
6. Example in an Orchestrator Recipe Step
text
- name: publish_data_event
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_pubsub
  function: run
  params:
    event: "data_loaded"
    payload:
      file: "Data/clean.csv"
      rows: 1000

- name: subscribe_data_event
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_pubsub
  function: run
  params:
    subscribe: "data_loaded"
  # ctx["events"] now contains only remaining events (if any)
7. Batch/Accumulator Example
python
# Publish several events
for i in range(5):
    run(ctx, {"event": "tick", "payload": {"i": i}})

# Later: get them all at once
ticks = run(ctx, {"subscribe": "tick"})
events = ticks.get("events", [])
for ev in events:
    print(ev["payload"]["i"])
Internal Structure
Each event is a dictionary. Minimum keys:

"event": type/name of the event/topic (e.g., "data_updated", "job_failed")

"payload": any data to be attached (optional)

All events are stored in a list: ctx["events"].

Publishing (event argument): appends event to ctx["events"]

Subscribing (subscribe argument): returns and removes matching events from ctx["events"]

If events not in ctx, it is initialized as an empty list.

Recommendations & Expansion Suggestions
General Best Practices
Always use clear, descriptive event names and include useful payloads for better downstream use.

Log all publishes to ctx for audit and debugging (already supported if running with orchestrator in debug mode).

Document custom event payload structures for future maintainability and broader integration.

Framework Enhancement Recommendations
Add Timestamps:

Automatically add a timestamp key to each event dict on publish, for later audit/history and ordering.

Example:

python
import time
timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
event = {"event": "foo", "payload": {...}, "timestamp": timestamp}
Add Event source Field:

Optionally add source (step name or module) to each event for provenance and easier debugging.

Retention and Auditing:

Add optional audit log for all published (and/or consumed) events, e.g. ctx["event_log"].

Wildcard/Pattern Matching Subscriptions:

Allow subscribing to all events or wildcard matches, e.g., { "subscribe": "*" } to fetch all.

Or partial match, { "subscribe": "job_" } to fetch all job_* event types.

Advanced Event Filtering:

Allow passing a filter function or dictionary to select only events matching some payload value.

Multi-process and Persistence:

Extend to support external brokers (e.g., Redis, or file-based persistence) for cross-process or distributed orchestrator runs.

Implement a wrapper/scriptlet for publishing/consuming via Redis as in ctx_event_bus_advanced.py.

Async Callbacks:

Hook support: allow registering callback functions or scriptlets to be invoked automatically when matching events are published (similar to observer pattern).

Rate Limiting / De-duplication:

Provide options to avoid duplicate events in rapid-fire scenarios, or batch/process them together.

Event Expiry:

Optionally expire (drop) events from the list after some TTL, or if not consumed after N steps.

Documentation & Example Scriptlets:

Add example scriptlet pairs for typical publish/subscribe recipes (e.g., trigger dialog/toast/pop-up in Dash after a file upload event).

Example Expansion: Timestamps and Source
python
import time
def run(ctx, params):
    if "events" not in ctx:
        ctx["events"] = []
    if "event" in params:
        event = {
            "event": params["event"],
            "payload": params.get("payload", {}),
            "timestamp": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
            "source": params.get("source", "unknown")
        }
        ctx["events"].append(event)
        return {"published": params["event"]}
    elif "subscribe" in params:
        # Extend for * or partial match if needed
        ev_type = params["subscribe"]
        matched = []
        remaining = []
        for ev in ctx["events"]:
            if ev_type == "*" or ev_type in ev["event"]:
                matched.append(ev)
            else:
                remaining.append(ev)
        ctx["events"] = remaining
        return {"events": matched}
    return {"status": "noop"}
Conclusion
ctx_pubsub.py is an effective lightweight mechanism for basic pub/sub communication inside the orchestrator’s shared context, enabling easy, decoupled workflow automation and UI interaction.

Future expansion should focus on timestamping, provenance, advanced filtering, multithreading/process support, and audit retention, while always maintaining JSON-serializability for ctx and CLI scriptlet independence.

By following these patterns, the file and its usage will remain robust, extensible, and closely aligned with the workspace standards.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_profiler.py – Detailed Documentation
Objective
The main objective of ctx_profiler.py is to profile code execution time and memory usage for any function, method, or code block within orchestrator scriptlets, steps, or Dash callbacks, and store the profiling data in shared ctx (“context”) for later reporting, dashboard display, or audit.

Description and Implementation
ctx_profiler.py provides a context manager called profile_ctx. When used to wrap a code block:

It records the start time and starting memory usage

After the code completes, it records the end time and ending memory usage

It computes:

Duration (seconds)

Memory before/after (bytes)

Memory delta (bytes)

It stores this information in ctx["profile"] as an appended dictionary

Key points:

Uses Python’s built-in tracemalloc module (provides memory allocation tracing)

Uses time.time() for timing in seconds (epoch)

Designed to be used as a context manager with with ...: or programmatically in function/scriptlets

Requirements/Dependencies
Python version: 3.6+

Standard library modules:

tracemalloc (for memory allocation tracking)

time (for timing)

contextlib.contextmanager (for context manager creation)

No third-party dependencies.

Limitations
Single-threaded/multi-process awareness:
Tracks memory usage for the current process/thread—if used across multiple threads/processes, entries might be ambiguous or less meaningful.

Profiling Granularity:
Memory and timing are only sampled at start/end—does not provide per-line or stepwise breakdown.

No I/O Profiling:
Tracks memory/time, not disk/network I/O.

Data stored in-memory:
If ctx["profile"] grows large (many steps), could become memory-heavy.

Not automatic—each code block/scriptlet must explicitly add the context manager.

Applications and Integrations
Where and how can you use it?
Step-level profiling in orchestrator recipes:
Add a profiling wrapper to each Python step to track duration and memory for every operation.

Dash callbacks:
Wrap expensive callbacks to diagnose UI latency or memory issues.

Custom scriptlets:
For any custom core or step scriptlet, wrap major computation blocks.

Testing and optimization:
Use in test cases to check performance regressions.

Performance audit reporting:
Data in ctx["profile"] can be visualized or further processed for dashboards/reports.

Integration Example
Suppose you have a recipe step as follows:

python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_profiler import profile_ctx

def run(ctx, params):
    with profile_ctx(ctx, "my_heavy_step"):
        # heavy computation
        result = [x * x for x in range(100000)]
        ctx["some_result"] = result
    return {"status": "done"}
After running, you’ll find a new entry in ctx["profile"]:

json
[
  {
    "step": "my_heavy_step",
    "start": 1693000000.123,
    "end": 1693000000.567,
    "duration": 0.444,
    "mem_start": 240232,
    "mem_end": 260000,
    "mem_delta": 19768
  }
]
Usage Examples
Basic Usage in a Scriptlet
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_profiler import profile_ctx

def run(ctx, params):
    with profile_ctx(ctx, "expensive_task"):
        # Your code here, e.g.:
        _ = sum([x**4 for x in range(1000000)])
    # Continue with rest
Profiling Part of a Dash Callback
python
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_profiler as ctx_profiler

@app.callback(Output(...), Input(...))
def callback(...):
    with ctx_profiler.profile_ctx(ctx, "dash_update"):
        # Data loading, processing, plotting, etc
        pass
    # callback return statement
Profile Multiple Steps in a Complex Scriptlet
python
def run(ctx, params):
    with profile_ctx(ctx, "load_data"):
        ...
    with profile_ctx(ctx, "compute_stats"):
        ...
    with profile_ctx(ctx, "save_results"):
        ...
Viewing Profile Logs for Dashboard
The profile log entries accumulate under ctx["profile"]

You might format and render these in a Dash DataTable or write to a log/report for performance analysis

Recommendation & Expansion Tips
Recommendations:
Automate step-level profiling:
Add optional support in runner.py to wrap all Python step executions in profile_ctx automatically (via decorator or context-manager), using the step’s name as step_name. This allows full-pipeline performance logs with zero modification in every scriptlet.

Add labels/metadata:
Permit attaching custom tags/parameters to entries (e.g., “user/recipe/params”), making it searchable and sortable in dashboards.

Include other resource stats:
Extend profiling to include CPU usage, I/O statistics, or number of threads.

Support for nested profiling:
Allow profiling blocks within blocks—capture stack/depth or parent/child relationships.

Export to CSV/JSON/Logs:
Add CLI entry points to dump ctx["profile"] to disk for offline or external analysis.

Suggested Features for Enhancement
Decorator Support:
Provide a decorator equivalent (in addition to contextmanager) for easy step/procedure profiling.

python
@profile_ctx_decorator(ctx, "foo_step")
def foo(...):
    ...
Long-Term Persistence:
Write out profiles to a persistent file (in /Logs/ or /Data/) at pipeline end or via a manual dump step.

Profiler Switch:
Add a config switch (e.g., ctx["enable_profile"]=True/False) to enable/disable profiling dynamically for debug or production runs.

Profiling Aggregation:
Provide summary stats: average/total step durations per step name, identify slowest steps automatically.

Integration with Orchestrator Digraph:
Add visualization of profiling data (e.g., durations as color-coding or edge-widths) in the pipeline graph output (Assets/graph.png).

Error/Exception Annotation:
Profile entries could be annotated if an error/exception occurred inside the block for fast diagnosis.

Best Practices for Compliance and Expansion
Always ensure JSON serializability for all data stored in ctx.

Use step_name as a unique identifier for each profiled block (e.g., include recipe name, step idx if not unique).

Avoid storing large binary data or function objects in ctx.

Keep the core profiling code pure-Python standard library for full portability and ease of deployment, in-line with framework standards.

Log all resource usage (as planned in the README) in sync with profiling for a holistic audit trail.

Summary Table
Aspect	Implementation/Behavior
Objective	Time and memory profiling of blocks/steps
Usage	with profile_ctx(ctx, "name"): ...
Data Output	Appended dicts in ctx["profile"] (list)
Integration	Scriptlets, Steps, Callbacks, Tests
Dependencies	Python 3.6+, tracemalloc, time, contextlib
Limitations	Not per-line, not automatic, no I/O/CPU yet
Expansion	Decorator, aggregation, auto-inject, dashboard
In summary:
ctx_profiler.py is a flexible, plug-and-play performance logger for any orchestrator code—directly supporting the framework’s goals for traceability, diagnostics, and metrics. By following best practices and considering suggested enhancements, it can become a foundation for automated, full-pipeline performance optimization and auditing.

ctx_print.py Comprehensive Documentation
Objective
The primary objective of ctx_print.py is to provide a simple, reusable, and CLI-friendly utility to pretty-print the current orchestrator context (ctx) as formatted JSON output. This supports:

Quick debugging

Snapshotting the state during workflows

Visibility for developers and testers into the state of shared data

Logging information in a human-readable format

Description
File location: scriptlets/python/core/ctx_print.py

Function: def run(ctx, params):

Operation: Converts the entire ctx dictionary, which is the shared, JSON-serializable orchestration context, into a neat, indented, and sorted JSON string and prints it to stdout.

Purpose:

To assist workflow developers, test authors, and step implementers in inspecting the current data/state of orchestration.

To provide a standardized, scriptable way to log the entire context to the logs, to the terminal, or as a diagnostic artifact.

Implementation excerpt:

python
import json

def run(ctx, params):
    print(json.dumps(dict(ctx), indent=2, sort_keys=True))
    return {"printed": True}
Dependencies
Python Standard Library:

json (for serialization)

Workspace Requirements:

Requires Python 3.6+ for workspace compatibility.

Assumes ctx is a dictionary-like structure (such as the orchestrator's Context class or plain dict), and is fully JSON-serializable.

Applications & Integration
Applications
Debugging:
Instantly view the full state of ctx before/after any orchestration step—essential for diagnosing unexpected results.

Testing:
Use in test harnesses to assert on the full serialized workspace state.

Audit Logging:
Capture readable snapshots as part of step logging for traceability.

Workflow Development:
Insert between steps in recipes to track context evolution over time.

Integration
CLI:
Can be imported and run from another script, or invoked directly as a function within other scriptlets.

Recipe steps:
Easily used as an atomic debugging step in any YAML recipe.

Unit tests:
Essential for verifying state transitions and for diffing before/after step ctx.

Limitations
Display only:
Only prints ctx to stdout. Does not save to a file—see recommendations for extension.

JSON-serializable types:
Requires the workspace guarantee—all values in ctx must be JSON-serializable.

No filtering:
Always prints the entire context, which can be excessively verbose for large or sensitive workflows.

No error handling:
If ctx contains unserializable content (should not happen in a compliant workspace), the scriptlet will raise a TypeError.

Not for production logs:
This scriptlet is primarily for development/debugging, not for systematic production logging or structured logging to files.

Usage
As a Python step in a recipe
text
- name: print_ctx_debug
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_print
  function: run
  params: {}
Output:
Prints the entire context to stdout during recipe execution.

CLI/Direct usage in script
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_print

ctx = {"foo": 1, "bar": [2, 3], "baz": {"hi": "there"}}
result = ctx_print.run(ctx, {})
# Output is printed to the console as pretty JSON
Adding it to a debug recipe for inspection
text
steps:
  - idx: 2
    name: print_ctx_midway
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_print
    function: run
    params: {}
Example Output
When ctx = {"alpha": 42, "beta": [1,2,3], "gamma": {"nest": "val"}}, calling run(ctx, {}) prints:

json
{
  "alpha": 42,
  "beta": [
    1,
    2,
    3
  ],
  "gamma": {
    "nest": "val"
  }
}
Recommendations & Expansion Suggestions
To maximize value and comply with best practices in your orchestrator framework, consider the following enhancements:

1. Output to File
Add a params["out"] option to save the context snapshot to a specified file.

python
def run(ctx, params):
    output = json.dumps(dict(ctx), indent=2, sort_keys=True)
    if "out" in params:
        with open(params["out"], "w") as f:
            f.write(output)
    print(output)
    return {"printed": True, "file": params.get("out")}
2. Key Filtering & Obfuscation
Optionally accept a keys parameter to restrict output to a subset of context keys, and/or an exclude list to omit sensitive keys.

Add params["keys"] for whitelist, or params["exclude"] for blacklist.

3. Mask Sensitive Data
Implement auto-detection or explicit specification of sensitive keys (e.g., containing "password", "token") and replace their values with "****" in the printout.

4. Structured Logging Integration
Allow logging to workspace logs (Logs/) by adding params["log"] = True to also append the output to a rotating log file, as per workspace standards.

5. Support for Large Contexts
Add optional pretty-printing only up to a certain number of elements for very large lists, or provide a summary mode.

6. Time-stamped Snapshots
Add an option to include the time of print, or to automatically generate time-stamped filename outputs, enabling auditing and regression debugging.

7. Integration with ctx_history
If available, provide an option to print the history of changes to each context key for full traceability.

8. Unit Test Coverage
Ensure the scriptlet itself is covered by unit tests in tests/ (e.g., test it with both empty, basic, and large/nested contexts).

Tips for Best Practice Usage
Add as a step before/after complex transforms in a recipe to capture changes.

Use for debugging recipe failures by inspecting context at the point of failure.

Combine with the workspace debug log system (ctx_debug.log) for rapid troubleshooting.

Avoid printing context with sensitive or personally identifiable information unless using filtering/masking.

Use in combination with other diagnostic scriptlets (e.g., ctx_history, ctx_snapshot, ctx_diff_report) for comprehensive state tracking.

Example: Enhanced Usage Scenario
Diagnostic snapshot after a pipeline stage:

text
- idx: 3
  name: snapshot_ctx_after_clean
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_print
  function: run
  params:
    out: "Logs/post_clean_ctx_snapshot.json"
    keys: ["data", "metrics"]
This would print (to stdout) and save (to file) only the relevant keys for auditing.

By taking these steps, you enhance both the immediate utility of ctx_print.py as a lightweight debug utility and its value as part of a traceable, auditable, and robust orchestration framework, fully aligned with your workspace's modular, testable, and extensible philosophy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_parallel.py – Comprehensive Documentation
Objective
Enable parallel execution of multiple functions (steps) using Python threads, facilitating concurrent computation/workflow stages within the orchestrator pipeline.

Collect results from each task in the shared in-memory context (ctx) using separate keys for each parallel branch.

Boost workflow performance by leveraging multi-threading for I/O-bound or lightweight CPU tasks, improving responsiveness in interactive or dashboard-oriented automation.

Description
ctx_parallel.py is a core utility scriptlet that allows you to run multiple independent functions in parallel using Python threads. Each function is specified as a task, along with a key in the shared context (ctx) for storing that function’s result after completion.

After all parallel functions finish, the function collects results in the main ctx object. This utility is ideal for scenarios where multiple, independent operations (such as data pre-processing, analytics, or external service requests) can proceed concurrently, thereby reducing overall workflow latency and enabling more interactive automation flows.

Key points:

Each task is specified in the tasks parameter:
{ "key": "unique_ctx_key", "fn": python_function, "args": {...} }

All results (or exceptions, if uncaught) are stored as ctx[key] per task.

Uses threading—efficient for I/O-bound or quick computations (not for CPU-bound parallelism; see recommendations).

Requirements / Dependencies
Python 3.6+ (for f-string and type hint compatibility)

Standard library only:

threading – to spawn and manage threads.

Context (ctx) object must be JSON-serializable (per overall orchestrator requirement).

All functions (fn) used in tasks must be pure, side-effect-aware, or properly handle context variables.

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
Applications
Batch-processing of multiple files, remote calls, or computations in parallel

Parallel data collection: e.g., simultaneously fetch from databases, APIs, or local sensors

Running data transformation and metric calculations simultaneously

Dash and dashboard-triggered background workers to support responsive UIs

Integration
Invoked within orchestrator recipes via a python step, as module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_parallel, function: run

Used as a "building block" in Dash apps for parallel callback workers

Can be combined with ctx_parallel_process.py (for process-based parallelism), ctx_job_queue.py (for managed queue), or ctx_bg_job.py

Usage Example: Basic Pattern
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_parallel

# Example tasks to run in parallel
def task1(x):
    return x * x

def task2(y):
    return y + 10

ctx = {}
params = {
    "tasks": [
        {"key": "result1", "fn": task1, "args": {"x": 5}},
        {"key": "result2", "fn": task2, "args": {"y": 7}},
    ]
}
ctx_parallel.run(ctx, params)
print(ctx["result1"])  # Output: 25
print(ctx["result2"])  # Output: 17
Usage in an Orchestrator Recipe Step
text
- name: run_parallel_tasks
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_parallel
  function: run
  params:
    tasks:
      - key: fetch_data
        fn: fetch_api_data  # this function must be importable in the orchestrator context
        args:
          endpoint: "https://..."
      - key: compute_stats
        fn: compute_stats
        args:
          dataset: "my_data"
Parallel Data Preprocessing
Suppose you want to flatten and normalize two datasets at once:

python
def flatten(data): ...
def normalize(data): ...
params = {
    "tasks": [
        {"key": "flat_a", "fn": flatten, "args": {"data": dataset_a}},
        {"key": "norm_b", "fn": normalize, "args": {"data": dataset_b}},
    ]
}
ctx_parallel.run(ctx, params)
Integration in Dash Callbacks
Parallelize I/O or calculations without blocking UI:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_parallel

def update_data(ctx):
    ctx_parallel.run(ctx, {
        "tasks": [
            {"key": "api_result", "fn": fetch_remote, "args": {"url": "..."}},
            {"key": "local_stats", "fn": compute_stats, "args": {"data": ctx["data"]}},
        ]
    })
Limitations
Threading Model: Uses Python threads, so true CPU-bound scaling is limited by the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock). For CPU-heavy tasks, use process-based parallelism (ctx_parallel_process.py).

Function Serialization: Each function (fn) to be called must be in the global scope (importable, not a local lambda) to allow pickling in process-based offshoots.

Result Return: No return value; results are deposited in ctx under specified task keys.

Error Handling: Exceptions in a single thread can halt the main thread if not internally caught. You may extend to store exceptions in results.

Task Independence: All tasks must be independent; no task can depend on results or side effects of another running task.

Side Effects: If your function mutates shared state, you must ensure thread-safety manually.

Debugging: Parallel error and log-tracing can be harder than with sequential logic—log judiciously and review Logs/ctx_debug.log in orchestrator debug mode.

Recommendations, Tips, and Expansion Suggestions
How to Expand or Enhance
Built-in Exception Handling & Results Semantics

Store any exceptions as { "error": "...", "traceback": "..." } under result keys in ctx for robust debugging.

Ensure that completing all threads does not propagate unhandled exceptions unless configured to do so.

Timeouts & Cancellation

Permit an optional timeout for all tasks or per-task, forcibly joining or cancelling threads after deadline expiry.

Result Aggregation Patterns

Provide optional output as a list or dict of results in a user-defined ctx[out] key, as well as per-task keys.

Allow filtering or post-processing of results through a reducer function.

Progress and Event Callbacks

Emit progress events to ctx["events"] for Dash or reporting.

Allow step audit-logging per thread using the orchestrator’s Logger utility.

Process-based Parallelism Switch

Add an option (mode: "thread"|"process") to run tasks either as threads or as separate processes (leveraging multiprocessing for heavy computation).

Defer to or wrap around ctx_parallel_process.py seamlessly as per workload.

Dynamic Function Importing

Allow tasks to specify fn as a string module:function name, enabling dynamic discovery/import—fully compliant with orchestrator extensibility.

Built-in Metrics and Tracing

Auto-log resource/time for each thread using the ctx_profiler.py or ctx_resource_monitor.py hooks.

Store per-task timing and memory delta in the result dict.

Automatic CLI Compliance and Discovery

Ensure CLI usage via an if __name__ == "__main__" block, printing log/messages per orchestrator requirements.

Register scriptlet in a step listing for easy discoverability.

Tips for Best Use in the Orchestrator Framework
Keep functions small, stateless and testable as mandated by framework guidelines.

Validate all input arguments and expected keys before dispatching to avoid runtime surprises.

Use only JSON-serializable types as outputs for ctx to maintain orchestrator compatibility.

Monitor and log all ctx changes with the built-in debug mode for auditability.

Defer to ctx_job_queue.py or ctx_parallel_process.py for larger, long-running, or CPU-bound workloads.

Document every composed recipe and scriptlet invocation per workspace style.

        {"key": "a", "fn": fn_a, "args": {...}},
        {"key": "b", "fn": fn_b, "args": {...}}
    ]})

Enhancements (Recommended):
    - Capture exceptions in results under ctx[key]
    - Support per-task timeouts, process-based mode, and resource tracing
    - Allow fn to be given as "module:function" for easier step registration
    - Emit events/logs for each task for Dash integrations
    - Allow result aggregation pattern for grouped ctx storage

Limitations:
    - Thread-based (not optimal for CPU-bound tasks); use ctx_parallel_process.py for heavy compute
    - All functions must be importable/pure and args JSON-serializable
    - Results are stored only in ctx, not returned

Complies with orchestrator's modular, composable, and testable scriptlet philosophy.
"""
By embracing the above suggestions, ctx_parallel.py will remain fully aligned with your workspace’s architecture, extensibility, and consistent scriptlet practices, while unlocking more robust and interactive parallel pipeline execution.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_notify.py
Objective
Provide a reusable, atomic mechanism to trigger notifications (currently Slack, extensible to email, SMS, etc.) in response to context (ctx) events during orchestrator workflows. It enables pipelines, dashboards, and operators to be notified when critical states or events are detected without breaking flow modularity or introducing notification-specific code into main scriptlets.

Description
What It Does:
ctx_notify.py exposes a single function run(ctx, params) which, based on the params["type"], dispatches a notification through the requested channel and returns a status (HTTP code, string, etc.).
Currently, it implements notification via Slack webhooks. The design supports straightforward extension to other notification types (email, SMS, etc.) in future PRs.

Integration Points:

Receives notification triggers dynamically from recipe steps, error handlers, or any scriptlet able to import and call it.

Does not directly read from or write to files or the operating system, aside from performing HTTP requests for outbound notifications.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library:

requests (external; install via pip install requests), used for HTTP POST requests to Slack webhooks or other RESTful endpoints.

Standard Python features for IO and data handling.

Workspace Assumptions:

params dictionary consistently specifies the notification type (e.g., "slack") and all required channel/endpoint configuration.

Application, Integration, and Usage
Common Use Cases
Pipeline step completion/failure notification
Receive a Slack notification when a test/job finishes, or something fails, so an operator doesn’t need to poll dashboards for status.

Event-driven alerts in Dash dashboards
If ctx reflects a threshold/trigger (e.g., “temperature spike”), send an outbound alert.

Integration in audit/report workflows
Automatically inform stakeholders when summary reports are generated and saved.

Example 1: Slack Notification
Recipe Step (YAML):

text
- name: notify_completion_slack
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_notify
  function: run
  params:
    type: "slack"
    webhook_url: "<YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL>"
    message: "Test pipeline completed successfully at {timestamp}"
Python Inline:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_notify

ctx_notify.run(ctx, {
    "type": "slack",
    "webhook_url": "<YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL>",
    "message": "Your orchestrator job is done!"
})
Result:
A message is posted to the Slack channel connected to the specified webhook.

Example 2: Custom Message Injected from ctx
Suppose a pipeline evaluates metrics and wants to notify with an AI-generated summary:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_notify
summary = ctx["ai_summary"]
ctx_notify.run(ctx, {
    "type": "slack",
    "webhook_url": "<WEBHOOK>",
    "message": f"AI Summary Ready: {summary}"
})
Example 3: Notification on Error (Manual)
Catch and notify on an error in a scriptlet:

python
try:
    # ...step logic...
except Exception as e:
    ctx_notify.run(ctx, {
        "type": "slack",
        "webhook_url": "<WEBHOOK>",
        "message": f"Error encountered: {str(e)}"
    })
    raise
Example 4: Triggering Email/SMS (Recommended for Extension)
Currently, returns {"status": "noop"} for unsupported types.

python
ctx_notify.run(ctx, {
    "type": "email",
    "to": "user@mail.com",
    "subject": "Alert",
    "body": "Step failed."
})  # Outputs {"status": "noop"}
(This is a proposed interface, not currently implemented.)

Limitations
Channels:
Only Slack webhook notifications are implemented. Other types (email, SMS, Teams, etc.) are placeholders as of this version.

Error Handling:
Limited to relaying HTTP status codes. Exceptions in HTTP requests are not deeply handled or logged to ctx.

No Batching:
Each notification is a one-off call; no throttling, batching, or aggregation.

No Rich Formatting:
Slack messages are plain text (no blocks/attachments).

Secrets Exposure:
Requires webhook URL to be specified, possibly hardcoded in recipe or secrets backend (roles/permissions responsibility falls to user).

Policy/Audit:
Does not record notification delivery in ctx; no notification audit trail by default.

Usage Patterns
Minimal Example from Recipe
text
- name: notify_slack
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_notify
  function: run
  params:
    type: "slack"
    webhook_url: "<WEBHOOK>"
    message: "Job completed"
Advanced Pattern in Audit/Error Handling
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_notify, ctx_logger

def run(ctx, params):
    try:
        # step logic
    except Exception as e:
        ctx_logger.run(ctx, {"msg": f"Failure: {e}", "level": "ERROR"})
        ctx_notify.run(ctx, {"type": "slack", "webhook_url": "<WEBHOOK>", "message": str(e)})
        raise
As Scriptlet CLI (not directly, but possible to wrap as a single-command test driver):
bash
python -c 'import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_notify as notify; notify.run({}, {"type": "slack", "webhook_url":"<WEBHOOK>", "message":"Quick test"})'
Recommendations for Expansion & Enhancement
Immediate Compliance Upgrades
Implement Email & SMS:

Add smtplib/email.mime for outbound email notifications.

Document SMTP config in params (server, from, to, subject, body).

(Optionally) leverage third-party API services (e.g., Twilio for SMS).

Add ctx Audit Trail:

On successful/failed notification, append an entry (type, destination, message, timestamp, result) to ctx["notifications"] for traceability and workflow review.

Error Logging:

Robust error-catching: if requests fail, log details to ctx["errors"] or ctx["notifications"].

Support for Notification Templates:

Allow message templating using ctx values so users can do:
message: "Job {ctx[test_id]} completed at {ctx[timestamp]}"
Optionally use Python’s str.format(**ctx).

Rich Slack Formatting:

Enable “blocks”/attachments so users can send structured messages.

Batched/Buffered Notifications:

Add a mode where notifications are buffered and dispatched at set intervals or only on failure.

Throttling/Deduplication:

Avoid spamming on noisy events: e.g., send only once per error type per job, apply user-configured limits.

CLI Wrapper Utility:

Make the scriptlet runnable as a CLI (with argparse) for shell/debug/manual usage.

Advanced Suggestions
Framework Integration:

Permit configuration of default notification channels at the workflow/recipe level, so users don’t pass URLs every time.

Integrate with orchestrator error-handling, automatically sending notifications on recipe failure.

User/Group Endpoints:

Support sending to multiple endpoints (e.g., list of Slack/Email addresses).

Notification Policy Scripting:

Allow recipes to specify notification filters (e.g., only alert on high-severity errors).

Asynchronous/Bulk Dispatch:

Use async HTTP/email libraries to avoid slow-down in workflows with lots of parallel notifications.

Tips for Usage and Expansion
Always keep notification logic out of main business logic; use the scriptlet approach for atomic, reusable notification steps.

Secure your webhook/email credentials separately from the recipe files; load from environment variables or a secrets manager when possible.

Use ctx-based templating for dynamic, context-aware messages.

When integrating additional notification channels, reuse the clean "type" switch design and document expected params for each type.

When extending, document parameter requirements/listings for each notification type, and update tests.

Wrap notification dispatches in error handling blocks to prevent disruptions in the pipeline if the endpoint is temporarily down.

Summary Table
Feature	Supported	Recommended Enhancement
Slack Notify	Yes	Rich formatting, batching, error audit
Email Notify	No	Add via smtplib/email.mime
SMS Notify	No	Add via Twilio or similar
ctx Audit	No	Add audit trail of notifications
Templating	Limited	Enable ctx-based automatic formatting
Async/Bulk	No	Use async libs for high-volume pipelines
Throttling	No	Avoid duplicate/spam notifications
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File: scriptlets/python/core/ctx_notify_advanced.py
Objective
To provide a modular notification utility for the orchestrator framework, allowing the pipeline or any scriptlet to send alerts and status messages to users or systems via common channels like Slack, email (SMTP), or (optionally) SMS. This enables monitoring, alerting, and automated communication on job results, errors, workflow milestones, or audit events.

Description
Purpose:
Acts as an outbound notification bridge; any orchestrator step or callback can invoke this scriptlet to dispatch a message when notable ctx events (such as job completion, error, progress, etc.) occur.

Supported Outputs:

Slack: Via webhook URL.

Email: Via SMTP.

Extensible: The structure allows easy addition for SMS or other channels.

Result Handling:
Returns a status dictionary indicating send status; can be expanded to provide logging or output reference in ctx.

Dependencies & Requirements
Python Standard Library:

smtplib – For sending email.

email.mime.text.MIMEText – To compose the email body.

PyPI:

requests – For HTTP POST to Slack webhook.

Python version:
Tested for 3.6+ (but standard for orchestrator is 3.8+).

Application, Integration & Usage Patterns
Application
Automated monitoring: Notify when a step completes, fails, or requires human attention.

Integration with workflow logic: Use after steps handling data uploads, reports, or error recovery, or in error callbacks.

Human-in-the-loop: Immediate email or Slack notification when certain checkpoints or manual handoff is required in the pipeline.

Integration
Recipe step:

Used as an atomic python step in a recipe to send a message when certain conditions are met.

Error handling:

Called from error handlers, e.g., custom error handler scriptlet or context manager.

Audit/completion:

At the end of the pipeline, used to report overall status to the team.

Limitations
Sync/blocking: Does not currently queue or retry failed notifications—failures may block the pipeline depending on runner settings.

SMTP default: Assumes SMTP server is reachable and trusted (localhost default); may require configuration for production.

SMS: Stub only—“add more notification types as needed.”

No rich formatting/attachments: Slack messages and emails are plain text; no markdown, files, or images included.

No template support: Notification content is static from params["message"]/params["body"], no handlebars or context interpolation.

No callback for delivery status: Only synchronous response ("status sent"), not true delivery confirmation.

Security: Does not sanitize inputs; care should be taken if using untrusted data.

Not intended for high-frequency/volume notification batching or multi-recipient management.

Detailed Usage Examples
1. Basic Slack Notification
python
run(ctx, {
    "type": "slack",
    "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/ABC/DEF/XYZ",
    "message": "Pipeline step completed."
})
Result: Posts a plain message to the designated Slack channel via the incoming webhook.

2. Email Notification
python
run(ctx, {
    "type": "email",
    "to": "user@example.com",
    "subject": "Job Failed: Data Ingestion",
    "body": "The data ingestion step failed due to a missing file.",
    "from": "orchestrator@example.org",         # optional
    "smtp_server": "smtp.example.org"           # optional, default is 'localhost'
})
Sends plaintext email via SMTP (local or remote).

Use "from" and "smtp_server" keys to control sender and routing.

3. Recipe Step Example
text
- idx: 20
  name: notify_on_finish
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_notify_advanced
  function: run
  params:
    type: slack
    webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
    message: "Automation completed successfully: {test_id}"
Best used after all main steps, or with added dynamic context using Jinja/str.format in 'message' or 'body'.

4. Error Handling Example
python
try:
    ... # some workflow
except Exception as e:
    ctx_notify_advanced.run(ctx, {
        "type": "email",
        "to": "admin@example.com",
        "subject": f"Orchestrator Error: {step_name}",
        "body": str(e)
    })
5. Integration in Audit or Event Logging
After updating ctx["audit"], send a summary or critical alert by invoking ctx_notify_advanced.run(ctx, { ... }).

Recommendations & Enhancement Suggestions
To align with framework best practices and extend utility, consider these enhancements:

1. Message Templating
Add support for Python .format() or Jinja2 templating so notifications can include dynamic ctx data:

Example:

python
"message": "Test {test_id} ({tester}) step {step_name} completed."
Allow templated variables substitution from ctx keys.

2. Asynchronous & Retry Logic
Offload notifications to a background thread or an async task queue for non-blocking workflow.

Optionally, allow steps to declare async_notify: true.

Implement exponential backoff/retries on failure, with configurable max attempts.

3. Multi-channel & Multi-recipient Support
Support list of recipients for email and Slack (multiple channels/webhooks).

Add SMS gateway integration (e.g., Twilio or Nexmo) as a new "type": "sms" block.

4. Rich Formatting and Attachments
Add support for basic Markdown/HTML in notification bodies when supported (e.g., Slack blocks, email html).

Add support to attach file artifacts to email/slack notifications (e.g., logs, reports).

5. Logging, Auditing, and Traceability
Log all notification attempts and their results in ctx["notifications"].

Tag notifications with ctx["test_meta"] for cross-reference.

6. Error Handling Enhancements
Catch and serialize any exceptions raised by notification code and store in ctx["notify_errors"].

7. Custom Notification Classes
Allow users to register or plug in their own notification backends.

8. Security & Validation
Sanitize all message inputs.

Optionally validate all required fields (fail early if missing critical keys).

9. Flexibility in Sender/Server Setup
Permit setting sender/display name (for emails), allow advanced SMTP auth settings, and TLS/SSL options.

10. Add "Success Criteria" for Verification
After sending a message, optionally allow a scriptlet to poll or verify receipt (for providers that support this).

Sample Next-Gen Usage Pattern Proposal
text
- idx: 42
  name: notify_audit_results
  type: python

    use_template: true         # enables templating with ctx vars
    retries: 3
    attach:
      - Data/audit_report.md
Conclusion
ctx_notify_advanced.py provides a robust, extensible base for flexible notification in orchestrator automations, and would benefit from further modularization and template-driven logic to maximize both human and machine notification reliability and usefulness. All recommended extensions are compatible with framework principles: scriptlet independence, composability, traceability, and JSON-serializable ctx integration.

ctx_merge.py Documentation
Path: scriptlets/python/core/ctx_merge.py

Objective
To merge two ctx keys, each of which is a list, into a new ctx key holding their concatenated contents.
This scriptlet provides a reusable, atomic utility for combining datasets in shared in-memory context (ctx) during orchestrator workflow execution.

Description
ctx_merge.py is a Python scriptlet designed for the Orchestrator Workspace framework. It takes two lists from the shared context (ctx)—specified by their keys—and concatenates them, storing the merged result under a designated key (usually a new key to avoid data loss). This pattern is useful for workflows that process or generate partial results in parallel or sequential steps and need a single unified data structure downstream (e.g., before exporting, reporting, or plotting).

Function signature:

python
def run(ctx, params):
    ...
where:

ctx: The orchestrator’s shared in-memory context (a dict-like object).

params: A dictionary containing:

"key1": Name of the first ctx key (list)

"key2": Name of the second ctx key (list)

"out": Name of the ctx key under which to save the merged list

Process:

Reads ctx values for "key1" and "key2"

Concatenates (+) the contents (order is key1 contents first, then key2)

Stores the result in ctx["out"]

Returns a dictionary containing the new merged length ({"merged_len": ...})

Dependencies / Requirements
Python version: 3.6+

Orchestrator context: Expects to be run inside the orchestrator, using the supplied ctx API.

Data: Both ctx[key1] and ctx[key2] must be lists (or default to empty lists if missing).

No external library dependencies are required.

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
Orchestrator Recipe Integration
As a recipe step (YAML example):

text
- name: merge_partial_results
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_merge
  function: run
  params:
    key1: partial_rows_A
    key2: partial_rows_B
    out: merged_rows
Modular Combination:
Combine lists produced by different branches or parallel steps such as in batch jobs, sharded data, or multiprocess fetching.

Pre-export Merging:
Before exporting merged datasets to CSV/Excel or databases:

text
- name: merge_for_export
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_merge
  function: run
  params:
    key1: results_batch1
    key2: results_batch2
    out: all_results
CLI / API Usage
Python API Usage:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_merge

ctx = {
  "batch1": [[1, 2], [3, 4]],
  "batch2": [[5, 6]]
}
ctx_merge.run(ctx, {"key1": "batch1", "key2": "batch2", "out": "all_data"})
# Result: ctx["all_data"] == [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
Composing with Parallel/Background Steps:

Launch multiple steps in parallel, each storing their results under different ctx keys.

Merge the results for unified downstream consumption, e.g.:

text
- name: merge_downloads
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_merge
  function: run
  params:
    key1: downloads_A
    key2: downloads_B
    out: downloads
Limitations
Assumes both ctx[key1] and ctx[key2] hold Python lists (lists of anything: dicts, lists, scalars).

If either key is missing, defaults to an empty list for that key (so merged result will not error but simply lack that input).

Does not handle de-duplication—concatenation only.

Does not check for data type or schema consistency between the two lists.

Overwrites ctx[out] if it exists (no cumulative merge).

No built-in logging, versioning, or traceability (rely on external orchestration/debug mode for tracking who/why merge occurred).

Handles only two lists at a time—cannot merge more than two keys at once.

Detailed Usage Examples
1. Concatenating Two Simple Lists
python
ctx = {
    "foo": [1, 2, 3],
    "bar": [4, 5]
}
out = ctx_merge.run(ctx, {"key1": "foo", "key2": "bar", "out": "all_nums"})
print(ctx["all_nums"])
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
2. Merging Lists of Dicts (e.g., records/rows)
python
ctx = {
    "records_A": [{"id": 1, "val": 10}, {"id": 2, "val": 12}],
    "records_B": [{"id": 3, "val": 42}]
}
ctx_merge.run(ctx, {"key1": "records_A", "key2": "records_B", "out": "records"})
# ctx["records"] => [{"id": 1, ...}, {"id": 2, ...}, {"id": 3, ...}]
3. Handling Missing Keys or Empty Lists
python
ctx = {"foo": [1, 2, 3]}
ctx_merge.run(ctx, {"key1": "foo", "key2": "missing_key", "out": "merged"})
# ctx["merged"] == [1, 2, 3]
4. Combining Results from Parallel Steps in a Recipe
text
- name: step_A
  type: python
  ...
  params: {out: "result_A"}
  parallel: true

- name: step_B
  type: python
  ...
  params: {out: "result_B"}
  parallel: true

- name: merge_results
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_merge
  function: run
  params:
    key1: result_A
    key2: result_B
    out: final_results
  depends_on: [step_A, step_B]
5. Merging for Dash Plotting
text
- name: merge_curves
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_merge
  function: run
  params:
    key1: timeseries_curve1
    key2: timeseries_curve2
    out: timeseries_merged
Then set ctx_key: timeseries_merged in your Dash app runner.

Recommendations & Tips for Enhancing ctx_merge.py
Possible Enhancements
Multi-key Merging:

Allow merging more than two lists (e.g., keys: ["foo", "bar", "baz"]), not just a pair.

Backward compatible: if only "key1" and "key2" present, original logic still works.

De-duplication Option:

Support a deduplicate boolean flag.
When enabled, scan and remove duplicates after concatenation (useful if record sets could overlap).

Order Specification:

Optional parameter to specify merge order (order: ["key2", "key1"] etc.) or a reverse boolean.

Schema Consistency Check:

Add parameter require_same_type: true, and throw or log a warning if lists hold different types.

Custom Merge Strategies:

Allow a user-defined merge_fn parameter: e.g., zip/flatten/interleave, not just +.

Logging and Auditing:

Use or call ctx_logger.py to log merge events (timestamp and which keys merged).

Include the operation in ctx’s history for traceability.

Optional Output Format:

Option to output as a set (for unique items), or wrap as a dict with extra metadata (counts, sources).

Interactive Mode / CLI:

If run as a standalone CLI, prompt user for key names and output key, then print before/after ctx states.

Validate inputs interactively if needed.

Integration with Background/Parallel Jobs:

If merging background job outputs, check job status first from ctx (see ctx_job_status.py).

All-list Merge Utility:

Add a flag to merge all keys in ctx that match a pattern (e.g. "batch_*"), with filter controls.

Tips for Expansion (Compliant with Framework Design)
Atomic & Reusable:
Maintain the atomic nature (single-responsibility) and composability.
Make enhancements opt-in via parameters, not by increasing complexity for the common path.

Consistent Logging:
Integrate ctx merge operations with centralized logging for easier debugging and auditability.

Backward Compatibility:
New options should not break recipes using the two-key legacy method.

Avoid Non-Serializable Objects:
Ensure merged results are always JSON-serializable; document that only JSON-safe data types are supported.

Document Examples & Limitations:
Provide at the top of the file:

Description, usages, limitations

Examples covering all advanced/edge cases supported

Unit Tests:
Expand tests/ to include test cases for all enhancements (multiple lists, deduplication, error handling for mismatched types, etc.).

Auto-discoverability:
Register the scriptlet for "auto-listing" in CLI-based step discovery if/when entry-point system is implemented.

Reporting Integration:
Optionally record number of duplicates dropped, lists merged, and record statistics alongside results in ctx for reporting.

Summary
ctx_merge.py is a versatile utility for the orchestrator, enabling list-level merging in Python-based workflow pipelines. Its strengths include simplicity, atomic design, and seamless integration into the orchestrator’s recipe and shared ctx pattern.
With recommended enhancements such as support for multiple keys, deduplication, advanced logging, and flexible output, it can become even more powerful and robust for both current and future automation needs. Be sure to keep all modifications backward compatible and in compliance with the framework's single-responsibility and JSON-serializability best practices.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_map.py – Comprehensive Documentation
Objective
The objective of ctx_map.py is to provide a reusable, atomic utility for applying a user-supplied function to each row in a ctx key (i.e., a list), with the results saved under a specified ctx key. This enables custom, pipeline-driven transformation of in-memory data between workflow steps, supporting the orchestrator’s goals of composability, JSON-safe operations, and traceable context mutation.

Description
Scriptlet Location:
orchestrator/scriptlets/python/core/ctx_map.py

Summary:
ctx_map.py defines a run(ctx, params) function that accepts:

ctx: the orchestrator’s shared in-memory context (must be a dict-like object).

params: a dictionary with parameters:

key: (str) – the ctx key holding the input list to map over.

fn: (callable) – a Python function to apply to each element of the list.

out: (str, optional) – the ctx key for output; defaults to ‘{key}_mapped’.

The function iterates over ctx[key], applies fn to each row, collects the results, and stores the result in ctx[out]. It returns {"mapped": out} to indicate the output key.

Core Signature:

python
def run(ctx, params):
    key = params["key"]
    fn = params["fn"]
    out = params.get("out", f"{key}_mapped")
    ctx[out] = [fn(row) for row in ctx[key]]
    return {"mapped": out}
Orchestrator Role:

Promotes modular, stepwise, and single-responsibility transformation during recipes or Dash callbacks.

Purely functional: does not mutate input data—only writes to a new key.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library: No extra dependencies; uses native list and dict.

Orchestrator Context: Must be used with a dict-like ctx as managed by Orchestrator.

No framework-specific import required for execution as a utility scriptlet.

Applications and Integration
Recipe Steps:
Used as part of a step in a YAML recipe, enabling mapping without requiring intermediate files.

Dash/Live App Integration:
Supports fast, in-memory transformation for Dash app data, e.g., column filtering, row filtering, enrichment, or feature derivation.

Pipeline Reuse:
Easily chained after upstream processing—e.g., after a normalization step or a row appender step, you can map for transformation, filtering, or data preparation before export or visualization.

Typical Use Cases:

Normalizing all numeric values in a dataset.

Filling missing values in each record.

Feature extraction for machine learning (e.g., computing derived columns from input data).

Simple row-based validation or enrichment (e.g., flagging or labeling).

Limitations
Input Must Be a List:

ctx[key] must be a list (e.g., list of lists or list of dicts). Using a non-iterable value will raise an error.

Callable Must Be Pure:

fn must be a function accepting a single argument (the row) and returning a single output row. Side effects are discouraged since all rows are processed, and errors in fn will stop all processing.

Not Serializable in Recipes:

Passing actual function objects via YAML is not possible. Must be used via dynamic or programmatic orchestration (i.e., called within a Python orchestrator step or via CLI with function defined in-code).

No Error Handling:

Scriptlet does not catch errors from the mapping function. If fn(row) fails, the whole step fails.

No Parallelism:

All rows are mapped sequentially; for large data or CPU-heavy operations, consider enhancement to support threading.

Usage
A. Python-Initiated Mapping
Basic Example:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_map

# Example input context
ctx = {"numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4]}

# Square each number
def square(x): return x * x

result = ctx_map.run(ctx, {"key": "numbers", "fn": square, "out": "numbers_squared"})
print(ctx["numbers_squared"])
# Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
Mapping Over a List of Dicts:

python
ctx = {"data": [{"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"a": 3, "b": 4}]}
def add_sum(row): row["sum"] = row["a"] + row["b"]; return row
out = ctx_map.run(ctx, {"key": "data", "fn": add_sum})
print(ctx["data_mapped"])
# Output: [{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'sum': 3}, {'a': 3, 'b': 4, 'sum': 7}]
Chaining in a CLI Scriptlet:

python
# Suppose scriptlets/python/custom_script.py
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_map as ctx_map
def custom_fn(row):
    return [item*2 for item in row]
ctx = {"vals": [[1, 2], [3, 4]]}
ctx_map.run(ctx, {"key": "vals", "fn": custom_fn})
print(ctx["vals_mapped"])
# Output: [[2, 4], [6, 8]]
B. In a Recipe (Pseudo-YAML explained):
text
- name: map_example
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_map
  function: run
  params:
    key: "input_rows"
    # Cannot directly encode fn here! Pass as argument in Python.
    out: "output_rows"
Note: In recipe YAML, you usually point to a scriptlet that wraps/imports ctx_map and passes the function in code, or use a one-off scriptlet for the mapping logic.

C. Data Cleaning Example:
python
def clean_row(row):
    # Replace missing values with zero
    return [x if x is not None else 0 for x in row]
ctx = {"raw": [[1, None, 3], [4, 5, None]]}
ctx_map.run(ctx, {"key": "raw", "fn": clean_row, "out": "cleaned"})
print(ctx["cleaned"])
# Output: [[1, 0, 3], [4, 5, 0]]
D. Filter Example:
python
def keep_even(row): return row if row % 2 == 0 else None
ctx = {"vals": [1,2,3,4,5,6]}
result = ctx_map.run(ctx, {"key": "vals", "fn": keep_even, "out": "evens"})
ctx["evens"] = [x for x in ctx["evens"] if x is not None]  # filter out None
# Output: [2, 4, 6]
Recommendations: Feature Enhancement and Framework Integration
To further improve ctx_map.py and align with the advanced, composable, and observable architecture outlined in the workspace/README:

1. Native Parallel Mapping
Add an optional parameter (e.g., parallel: true or threads: N) to run mapping in parallel using threading or concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor.

Useful for CPU-light but row-heavy transformations.

2. Safe YAML-Driven Functionality
Allow mapping with predefined, registered transformation functions based on string keys (e.g., "fn": "double" resolves to an internal dict of safe functions), enabling mapping by name in recipes/YAML without code changes.

3. Error Handling and Row-level Logging
Add optional parameters for error trapping on a per-row basis (log failed rows, skip, or stop).

Optionally record which rows failed to process and why in ctx["map_errors"].

4. Context-Aware Function Registry
Use a registry system (see “auto-discovery” in workspace) where all mapping functions are registered with documentation. Users can list or select functions at runtime.

5. Metadata and Audit Logging
Log all mapping operations to ctx["log"] with step details.

Record input/output statistics (counts, types, sample before/after).

6. Dry-Run/Preview Mode
Support a dry_run: true or preview: N param to process only the first N rows, supporting recipe testing.

7. Support for DataFrame-like Operations
Optionally auto-convert list of dicts to pandas DataFrame (if pandas available), supporting richer transformations with less code for data scientists.

8. CLI Enhancements
Enable ctx_map.py to be run as a command line tool reading/writing JSON files, accepting mapping operations by string (via registry), bringing it in line with the "independent CLI utility" criterion in the README.

9. Documentation and Examples
Add full docstring, usage, parameter explanation, examples inline, and expose CLI --help.

Generate example YAML snippets and auto-validate parameters for recipe authors.

10. Full Serialization Validation
Before and after mapping, validate output for JSON-serializability; raise or log any serialization issues (critical for orchestrator compliance).

Best Practices / Tips
Keep mapping functions pure (no side effects, no access to ctx except via argument).

Always use a new out key to prevent overwrite of source data unless explicitly intended.

For production usage in recipes, ensure that the mapping function is deterministic and tested via orchestrator unit tests.

Chain mapping and filtering: run once with ctx_map, then filter output to remove None or unwanted rows.

Use ctx_map as a building block in pipeline step design, not for monolithic, multi-purpose transformations.

Summary:
ctx_map.py is a lean, highly reusable scriptlet that fits squarely within the orchestrator’s philosophy: atomic, testable code that enables declarative, incremental ctx transformation for data analysis and automation workflows. With the recommended improvements, it can further evolve into a powerful, transparent, and user-friendly mapping workhorse for both CLI and recipe-defined pipelines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_logger.py
Location: orchestrator/scriptlets/python/core/ctx_logger.py

Objective
The primary objective of ctx_logger.py is to provide a standardized, simple, and reusable way to log messages, events, and diagnostics into the shared in-memory context (ctx) during orchestrator workflow execution.
It ensures every log entry is timestamped and categorized by severity, which enables traceability, audits, debugging, and downstream reporting.

Description
ctx_logger.py exposes a single function: run(ctx, params).

It appends log entries to the ctx["log"] list.

Each entry includes a timestamp (local time, human-readable), a log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, etc.), and an arbitrary message.

Log messages are always associated with a particular step and context at runtime.

Function definition:

python
def run(ctx, params):
    msg = params["msg"]
    level = params.get("level", "INFO")
    if "log" not in ctx:
        ctx["log"] = []
    ctx["log"].append({
        "timestamp": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
        "level": level,
        "msg": msg
    })
    return {"log_len": len(ctx["log"])}
Dependencies
Python 3.6+

Standard library:

time (for timestamp formatting)

No external packages required.

Applications and Integration
How and where to use:

Step-level logging:
Log every major action, decision, or result in each orchestrator step, including parameter choices, computed outputs, and failures.

Debugging and development:
Insert logging before, during, and after key operations to trace the flow of data and control.

Permanent workflow audit trails:
Entries in ctx["log"] are persisted with ctx and can be written out for analysis or compliance reporting.

Dash/streamlit/HTML dashboard display:
Logs can be rendered live in dashboards for both users and operators.

Error and exception handling:
Record errors and unexpected situations for later forensic analysis (e.g., by custom error handlers or in except blocks).

Automatic log ingestion:
Can be used with ctx_debug_dump.py for exporting logs to disk or with notification scriptlets for alerting on specific log levels.

Cross-scriptlet/world:
Any Python scriptlet in the orchestrator can use this logger, and all log entries end up in a single unified list in ctx.

Limitations
Only logs to in-memory ctx["log"]; does not write directly to file (use ctx_debug_dump.py or ctx_to_file.py for output).

No built-in log rotation, searching, or pruning—log lists can grow large in long workflows.

Log levels are not enforced beyond display (no filtering, subscriptions, etc.).

Not thread-safe by itself; if used in background threads with non-atomic writes, may require additional synchronization for critical workloads.

All log entries share the same flat structure—no hierarchical nesting or correlation IDs.

Timezone is system-dependent (uses time.strftime).

Usage
Basic Example
Within any Python scriptlet:

python
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_logger as ctx_logger

def run(ctx, params):
    ctx_logger.run(ctx, {
        "msg": "Step started: initializing data",
        "level": "INFO"
    })
    # your code here...
Logging an error
python
try:
    # Something that might fail
    result = compute_something()
except Exception as e:
    ctx_logger.run(ctx, {
        "msg": f"Error encountered: {e}",
        "level": "ERROR"
    })
Scriptlet usage in a Dash app
python
# Inside a Dash callback or app scriptlet
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_logger as ctx_logger

@app.callback(...)
def my_callback(...):
    ctx_logger.run(ctx, {
        "msg": "User clicked the update button",
        "level": "INFO"
    })
Logging warnings or custom levels
python
ctx_logger.run(ctx, {
    "msg": "Missing optional parameter; using default value",
    "level": "WARN"
})
After adding log messages, export full log (to file) for offline review
python
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_debug_dump as ctx_debug_dump
ctx_debug_dump.run(ctx, {"out": "Logs/my_step_ctx_log.json"})
Example Log Output (ctx["log"])
json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-08-26 04:02:31",
    "level": "INFO",
    "msg": "Loaded normalized CSV file"
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-08-26 04:02:32",
    "level": "WARN",
    "msg": "No data rows present in input; continuing with empty dataset"
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-08-26 04:02:33",
    "level": "ERROR",
    "msg": "Column count mismatch: expected 7, got 6"
  }
]
Advanced Usage
Log complex information (serialize objects with str() or json.dumps()):

python
import json
log_data = {"rows_loaded": 120, "step": "load_csv"}
ctx_logger.run(ctx, {
    "msg": f"Loaded data: {json.dumps(log_data)}",
    "level": "INFO"
})
Bulk logging in a for-loop:

python
for record in batch_results:
    ctx_logger.run(ctx, {
        "msg": f"Processed record ID: {record['id']} with result: {record['status']}",
        "level": "INFO"
    })
Recommendations & Suggestions for Enhancement
1. Add Support for Log Filtering and Querying
Allow querying the in-memory log for specific levels, time ranges, or keywords, e.g., ctx_logger.filter(ctx, level="ERROR", since="2025-08-25").

Implement helper utilities to extract only recent error messages or per-step logs for dashboards.

2. Enable Log Rotation and Pruning
Option to truncate or rotate the log if it exceeds a certain size in entries or memory footprint (protects against long-running pipelines).

3. Hierarchical or Step-Scoped Logging
Allow for hierarchical grouping by step, or enrich each log entry with the current step name, so user can easily filter or trace logs per workflow step.

Add an optional step parameter to the logger for this purpose.

4. Integration with Notification/Alert System
Trigger Slack/email/SMS notifications for ERROR or WARN level logs automatically by calling notification scriptlets when these levels are logged.

Support alert hooks to pipe critical logs to ctx_notify.py or ctx_event_bus.py.

5. Enhanced Timestamping
Store timestamps as ISO 8601 strings (or as a UNIX timestamp field) for better interoperability, e.g.,
"timestamp": "2025-08-26T04:05:30Z" and/or "ts_epoch": 1766895930.12345

6. Log Level Consistency and Custom Levels
Define standard log levels as constants (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG, SUCCESS, CRITICAL) and enforce their use via an enum or validation.

Allow custom log levels or tags for context-specific events.

7. Thread-Safety
Switch from a plain list to a thread-safe deque or use threading.Lock() when appending in parallel contexts, if frequent background logging is expected.

8. External Export and Ingestion
Bundle with utilities to batch-upload logs to external stores (e.g., SQLite, CSV, or remote log servers) at the end of a job.

Add a write_to_file helper or integrate directly with ctx_to_file.py.

9. Log Validation/Schema Enforcement
Enforce a strict schema for each log entry, reject incomplete or malformed entries (catch missing "msg", "level", or "timestamp" keys).

10. Enhanced CLI Support
Allow standalone CLI logging for quick diagnostics and manual debugging:

text
python scriptlets/python/core/ctx_logger.py --msg "Manual log entry" --level INFO
Conclusion
ctx_logger.py is a foundational utility for the orchestrator framework, ensuring robust, standardized, and auditable logging at every step of pipeline execution.
By implementing the above enhancements and leveraging its central log store, both usability and operational robustness will be improved—especially for real-world, production-grade automation frameworks where traceability is critical.

Always log early, log often, and structure logs for both humans and machines!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for ctx_llm_tool.py
Objective
ctx_llm_tool.py enables orchestrator pipelines and scriptlets to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as a generic tool to process, transform, or generate content from ctx data. Its purpose is to bridge orchestrator workflows with advanced AI, facilitating tasks such as:

Programmatic text/data cleaning and normalization

Automatic report or summary generation

Dynamic code suggestions or code transformation

Any custom LLM-powered transformation or inference on ctx content

It is intentionally general: you specify what on ctx to process, how (via prompt/instruction), and where to store the result.

Description
Accepts inputs specifying a ctx key to read, a prompt/instruction, and a key to write the LLM result to.

Sends data and instruction to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo) via API.

Returns the raw LLM output in the target ctx key, so further parsing/validation can be scripted by subsequent steps.

Ensures the pipeline is modular: LLM output is not auto-evaluated/executed for safety.

Designed to handle both code and text generation as well as text-based data transformations.

Dependencies
openai: Python package for the OpenAI API.

API access/credentials (usually via an environment variable such as OPENAI_API_KEY or explicit key configuration).

Python 3.6+.

The scriptlet itself (as with all in the framework) requires orchestrator's pipeline structure and a valid ctx object.

Application & Integration
This scriptlet is to be used within orchestrator recipes or as an atomic operation in custom Python pipelines.
Common use cases include:

Data Cleaning (LLM as Data Cleaner): Provide raw records as input, get cleaned/normalized output as LLM-generated JSON, CSV, or text.

Text Summarization: Summarize large text columns or blobs in your ctx, storing summaries alongside the originals.

Code Generation: Have the LLM generate Python (or other) code for small ETL or data tasks based on instructions and current ctx.

Content Transformation: Reword product titles, create marketing copy, etc. for each entry in a ctx list.

Semantic Parsing: Ask LLM to extract structured info (dates, numbers, names) from raw strings or unstructured blobs.

Can be invoked:

As a step in a YAML recipe

Directly from orchestrator's Python runners in custom logic

CLI if wrapped with command-line parsing

Limitations
LLM Output is Raw: It only stores the raw string/text the LLM returns—extra parsing or validation is your responsibility.

Data Privacy: Sending data to a 3rd-party (OpenAI). Use caution with sensitive information.

Cost/Token Quotas: Usage of commercial LLM APIs may incur cost or rate limits.

No Type Enforcement: The scriptlet does not check types/format of output—it assumes subsequent steps/scriptlets validate or use the result.

Lack of Robust Error Handling: As written, most errors in the API call or invalid inputs will likely cause exceptions—should be handled upstream or with enhancement.

Serialization Requirement: All data loaded from ctx must be JSON serializable as with all orchestrator steps.

Usage
As an orchestrator recipe step (YAML):
text
- name: clean_raw_text_with_llm
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_llm_tool
  function: run
  params:
    key: "raw_text"
    out: "cleaned_text"
    instruction: "Clean and normalize each sentence. Remove typos, make all lowercase, and return as a list."
In a Python orchestrator/step:
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_llm_tool

# Assume ctx is a dict or orchestrator Context()
ctx['raw_input'] = [
    "ThIs is MESSy.",
    "   coRRect  this texte!"
]
result = ctx_llm_tool.run(ctx, {
    "key": "raw_input",
    "out": "clean_sentences",
    "instruction": "Clean all sentences: fix grammar, correct typos, lowercase, one per line."
})
print(ctx["clean_sentences"])
Example: LLM code generation
text
- name: generate_python_summary
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_llm_tool
  function: run
  params:
    key: "sales_csv"
    out: "llm_python_code"
    instruction: "Generate Python code to compute the total sales from this csv-formatted data."
Example: Data transformation
text
- name: transform_product_names
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_llm_tool
  function: run
  params:
    key: "products"
    out: "products_better"
    instruction: "For each product entry, make a catchy title suitable for an Amazon listing. Return as a list."
Example: Batch summary
text
- name: summarize_long_report
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_llm_tool
  function: run
  params:
    key: "long_report"
    out: "report_summary"
    instruction: "Summarize this report into five concise bullet points."
Recommendation & Enhancement Proposals
To further improve ctx_llm_tool.py—ensuring compliance and utility across your orchestrator framework—consider the following:

1. Result Parsing and Format Options
Add an optional parse_output or format parameter, which could:

Attempt to parse LLM output as JSON (if specified)

Store both raw and parsed output, or raise an error if parsing fails

Example param:

text
parse_output: "json"
2. Robust Error Handling
Wrap the entire LLM call in try/except and log API errors into ctx (optionally to a ctx["errors"] key).

Allow recipe authors to choose if execution should halt or skip step on error.

3. Batch/Chunked Processing
Enable automatic chunking of large input data, sending multiple smaller requests to avoid API token limits.

Aggregate or merge LLM outputs back into a single ctx entry on step completion.

4. Customizable Model/Temperature
Allow the recipe or step params to specify LLM model (model param) and sampling parameters (temperature, max_tokens).

5. Streaming Support
For large responses, optionally stream LLM output into ctx as it arrives (if supported by the backend).

6. Prompt Templates & Versioned Prompts
Support named prompt templates (as files or ctx keys) to standardize LLM instructions across recipes.

Store prompts and responses alongside step audit for reproducibility.

7. Chain-of-Thought & Multi-step LLM
Integrate with your other prompt-chaining scriptlet (ctx_llm_prompt_chain.py) for multi-turn and multi-step prompting.

8. Decorator Support and Modular Hooks
Use a decorator around run to add logging, error handling, resource profiling.

Optionally allow pre- and post-processing hooks for complex pipelines.

9. Security Checks
Sanitize LLM-generated code or outputs before using (especially if auto-evaluating).

Warn users if their prompt might lead to injection or unsafe evaluation.

10. CLI Usage Mode
Add an entrypoint (like if __name__ == "__main__":) with argument parsing for direct CLI batch use.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_llm_prompt_chain.py
Objective
ctx_llm_prompt_chain.py provides a reusable scriptlet for chaining multiple Large Language Model (LLM) prompt completions, where each prompt can take as input the output of a previous step, and all results are stored in ctx. The core idea is to facilitate multi-step LLM workflows, with traceable, JSON-serializable context for orchestrator recipes.

Description
Accepts a sequence ("chain") of prompts, where each specifies:

a prompt (system instruction/message)

an input_key (ctx key whose value is used as input to the LLM for this step)

an out (ctx key to store this step's output)

Each step sends a prompt + input to the LLM (via openai.ChatCompletion.create), receives the output, and stores it in ctx[out].

All steps are executed in strict order, so intermediate results may be re-used (for example, you can summarize, then question, then classify that summary, etc.).

All outputs are JSON-serializable and traceable via the orchestrator's context and debugging/logging.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+

openai python client library
(must be installed and properly configured with an OpenAI API key)

All dependencies of the framework runner and orchestrator (e.g., JSON, context handling)

Only uses standard library outside of openai

Note: Requires internet access for calling LLM APIs.

Application, Integration, and Usage
Applications
Data Summarization Flows: Summarize complex data, generate points, then ask follow-up LLM questions.

Automated Reporting: Chain analysis/summarization and report generation prompts.

Data Cleaning with LLMs: Clean data, validate, and post-process through multiple prompt steps.

AI-driven Workflow Chains: Any scenario where a sequence of LLM decisions/tasks is required.

Integration
Directly as an atomic Python scriptlet within any orchestrator recipe step (type: python).

Can be called as a module in custom Dash callbacks or other automation tools if desired, by passing ctx and params.

Composable in recipes with dependencies on upstream ctx keys.

Recipe Example
text
- name: llm_prompt_chain_example
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_llm_prompt_chain
  function: run
  params:
    chain:
      - prompt: "Summarize this dataset in 1 paragraph."
        input_key: "raw_text"
        out: "summary"
      - prompt: "List 3 frequently asked questions about this summary."
        input_key: "summary"
        out: "faq"
      - prompt: "Suggest a catchy headline for the FAQ."
        input_key: "faq"
        out: "headline"
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
Programmatic Usage Example
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_llm_prompt_chain

ctx = {
  "raw_text": "Long report or text here..."
}
params = {
  "chain": [
    {"prompt": "Summarize in 50 words.", "input_key": "raw_text", "out": "summary"},
    {"prompt": "Give a bullet list of 5 key points.", "input_key": "summary", "out": "bullets"},
  ],
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
}

# Execute the chain
ctx_llm_prompt_chain.run(ctx, params)

# Now ctx['summary'] and ctx['bullets'] are filled with the LLM outputs
CLI Usage
Since this scriptlet is meant for orchestrator integration, it is typically run via a recipe step (not as a standalone script), but it can also be imported and run from a Python shell as above.

Limitations
LLM API Access: Requires a working OpenAI API key and internet access.

Rate Limits/Costs: Multiple chained LLM calls may be subject to OpenAI API quotas and cost per call.

Input/Output Size: Large input/output can hit token or size limits of the LLM model.

Error Handling: Scriptlet does not internally retry on LLM API errors or handle API outages—handle in the recipe or outer orchestration.

Step Outputs: All intermediate outputs are strings (as returned by the LLM). If a step expects a list, dict, or other structure, add parsing as a separate step/scriptlet.

No LLM Parameter Customization per-step: Use the same model and standard ChatCompletion API for all steps in the chain.

No Built-in Logging: Logging of prompts/results is up to framework debug/log hooks or recipe-level debug mode.

No Branching: All chains are linear; steps are executed in order without conditional logic or branching.

Examples
1. Data Review Chain:

text
- name: document_review
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_llm_prompt_chain
  function: run
  params:
    chain:
      - prompt: "Summarize this document."
        input_key: "doc_text"
        out: "doc_summary"
      - prompt: "What are three potential biases in this summary?"
        input_key: "doc_summary"
        out: "bias_review"
      - prompt: "Correct the summary for neutrality based on these biases:"
        input_key: "bias_review"
        out: "neutral_summary"
2. Conversational Flow:

text
- name: conversation_chain
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_llm_prompt_chain
  function: run
  params:
    chain:
      - prompt: "You are a math tutor. Explain this problem in simple terms."
        input_key: "question"
        out: "explanation"
      - prompt: "What common misunderstanding happens with this explanation?"
        input_key: "explanation"
        out: "misunderstanding"
      - prompt: "How would you address that misunderstanding?"
        input_key: "misunderstanding"
        out: "clarification"
    model: "gpt-4"
Recommendations for Feature Expansion and Enhancement
To make ctx_llm_prompt_chain.py even more powerful and framework-compliant, consider:

1. Step-level Model and Parameters
Allow specifying model, temperature, and other LLM options per chain step.

Example:

text
chain:
  - prompt: ...
    input_key: ...
    out: ...
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    temperature: 0.7
2. Robust Error Handling
Add:

Optional retries with exponential backoff for API errors.

Configurable error-handling policy ("fail fast", "skip step", "return default").

3. Structured Output Parsing
Optionally parse LLM outputs to JSON, lists, or dicts based on a schema or output_type parameter.

Optionally add a parse callable per step, or a reference to a scriptlet/parser.

4. Recipe-level Logging and Auditing
Log every prompt, input, response, and timing to ctx['audit'] or a dedicated log key for traceability (align with framework's traceability).

Optionally, support a debug flag in params.

5. Template Support in Prompts
Support Jinja2- or .format-style templating for prompts with references to ctx keys or earlier outputs (e.g., "Summarize {ctx[previous_step]}").

6. Branching/Conditional Chains
Allow steps to be conditionally included or skipped based on previous outputs.

Example: Add a skip_if or when clause referencing values in ctx.

7. Batch/Parallel Support
Allow some steps to process lists of inputs in parallel (e.g., summarize many documents in one chain call).

8. UI Integration
Optionally, auto-emit ctx event notifications after each LLM chain step to trigger downstream Dash dashboard updates (see event bus patterns from your framework).

9. Documentation Generation
Auto-generate schema docs for the chain, suitable for inclusion in recipe-level documentation or Dash UI tooltips.

10. CLI Wrapper
(Optional) Add a CLI mode for standalone experimentation and debug, using argparse and stdin for rapid prompt chaining.

Tips for Reusability & Compliance
Always keep LLM chain steps atomic and single-responsibility.

Document every new LLM-powered chain thoroughly, including example input, expected output, and downstream keys.

Validate and sanitize all user/ctx input before sending to LLM.

All ctx keys must hold only JSON-serializable values.

Audit all LLM usage for cost and privacy compliance.

By following these recommendations, ctx_llm_prompt_chain.py will remain maximally portable, testable, and adaptable to evolving workflow and automation needs of your orchestrator framework.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for ctx_llm_batch.py
(Located in: scriptlets/python/core/ctx_llm_batch.py)

Objective
Provide a batch interface for sending multiple ctx (context) data items through an LLM (Large Language Model) API (e.g., OpenAI), and store the results collectively back into the shared in-memory context (ctx).

Enable automated summarization, question generation, data transformation, and mass LLM annotation over many slices of the orchestrator's pipeline, without manual, repetitive code per item/key.

Description
ctx_llm_batch.py automates the process of batch-calling LLM APIs (such as OpenAI's GPT family) over multiple keys in the orchestrator's shared ctx dictionary.
It allows you to:

Specify a list of ctx keys (datasets, objects, strings, tables, etc.).

Provide a common instruction prompt (e.g., summarize, analyze, transform, create questions).

It will iterate over all specified keys,

Pass the content to the LLM,

Collect the returned responses (typically text completions),

Store all outputs together as a dictionary in a designated output key in ctx.

All operations are JSON-serializable, comply with orchestrator logging/tracing, and keep ctx changes traceable and reproducible.

Dependencies
Python: 3.8+

Third-party:

openai Python SDK (for ChatCompletion.create)

Standard Library: None special (iteration, dict, string as used)

Note: User must export/import their OpenAI API key as required by openai SDK.

Applications & Integrations
Bulk summarization, tagging, code or text transformation in data processing pipelines (AI workbench, report generation, data cleaning, etc.)

Pre/post-processing before dashboard or report steps (e.g., auto-generate markdown for reviews, summaries, or explanations for each input table or row).

Data validation or cleaning with LLM-based rules.

Automated test-case/question generation for each dataset dynamically loaded into ctx.

Use in recipes for automatic documentation or log enrichment.

Example Application in a Recipe
text
- name: batch_summarize_metrics
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_llm_batch
  function: run
  params:
    keys: ["model_a_metrics", "model_b_metrics", "model_c_metrics"]
    out: "metrics_summaries"
    prompt: "Summarize this model's evaluation metrics in plain English."
After execution:

The ctx will have a new metrics_summaries key:

python
{
  "model_a_metrics": "LLM summary ...",
  "model_b_metrics": "LLM summary ...",
  "model_c_metrics": "LLM summary ...",
}
Limitations
API Rate Limits: OpenAI (or equivalent) applies rate limits per API key; large batches may hit these, causing failures or delays.

Serial/Non-parallel Calls: Out of the box, all LLM calls are performed in a for-loop (no parallelism/multithreading) – long lists of keys may slow execution.

Text Handling: Each input is coerced to a string for LLM consumption. Very large or non-text data may induce LLM errors or be truncated.

LLM Prompt Consumption: Prompt and data for each call are static (not customizable per-key) unless expanded via a code edit.

No Automatic Retry/Error Handling: If an LLM call fails, only a Python exception will be raised—partial completion isn’t stored.

Security: No sanitizing of prompt or data—ensure user inputs or ctx contents are safe for external API calls.

Extension: Only designed for OpenAI-compatible APIs. To use with Huggingface, Azure, or other LLMs, the LLM call logic must be generalized.

Usage
Basic (Python) Usage
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_llm_batch

ctx = {
    "text1": "First block of data to summarize...",
    "text2": "Second block of data to summarize...",
}
params = {
    "keys": ["text1", "text2"],
    "out": "summaries",
    "prompt": "Summarize the following content in 3 sentences."
}
ctx_llm_batch.run(ctx, params)
print(ctx["summaries"])
# Output: {"text1": "...summary...", "text2": "...summary..."}
Calling in a Recipe Step
text
- name: batch_llm_questions
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_llm_batch
  function: run
  params:
    keys: ["intro_paragraph", "chapter1", "chapter2"]
    out: "questions"
    prompt: "Generate 3 comprehension questions about this text."
Custom Prompt per Step
You can adjust the prompt to suit your application (classification, transformation, etc.):

text
- name: batch_clean_data
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_llm_batch
  function: run
  params:
    keys: ["raw_html1", "raw_html2"]
    out: "cleaned_texts"
    prompt: "Extract all the useful information from the following HTML and return it as clean text."
Command Line Integration (Pseudo-Cli)
(Python only; this scriptlet does not support direct CLI usage without orchestrator.)

Detailed Example
Objective: Batch-summarize CSV column lists for reporting.

Assume:

python
ctx = {
    "customer_data": [
        ["John", "Doe", "Active", "john@example.com"],
        ["Jane", "Smith", "Inactive", "jane@example.com"]
    ],
    "order_data": [
        ["Order123", "Pending", 99.99],
        ["Order124", "Completed", 49.99]
    ]
}
Recipe Step:

text
- name: batch_summarize_datasets
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_llm_batch
  function: run
  params:
    keys: ["customer_data", "order_data"]
    out: "table_summaries"
    prompt: "Summarize this table as if explaining what data it contains to a new analyst."
Resulting ctx:

python
ctx["table_summaries"] = {
    "customer_data": "This table contains customer names, status, and emails...",
    "order_data": "This table contains order numbers, status, and amounts..."
}
Recommendations & Tips for Expansion
1. Parallelism
Enhance: Use Python's concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor or asyncio to parallelize LLM API calls.

Benefit: Dramatic reduction in latency for large batches.

2. Custom Prompt/Config Per Key
Enhance: Accept an optional dict of {key: prompt} alongside the prompt string, so each key (data slice) can have a unique prompt (question, style, etc.).

Benefit: More flexible, dynamic LLM workflows.

3. Error Handling and Partial Results
Enhance: Catch and store per-item errors in ctx, e.g., as "error" keys in the output dict, and proceed with others.

Benefit: Robustness to API hiccups, transparent reporting of what failed vs. succeeded.

4. Alternative LLM Backends
Enhance: Abstract out the call logic to optionally use Huggingface, Azure, or self-hosted endpoints, switching via a param such as backend: openai|huggingface|....

Benefit: Flexibility for future LLM solutions.

5. Streaming or Chunking Large Data
Enhance: For large ctx values, detect size and split/chunk before sending to LLM, auto-concatenate or summarize results.

Benefit: Avoids LLM context/token limits, processes big data.

6. Prompt Templates
Enhance: Support prompt templates with {key_name} variable substitution, e.g.,
"Summarize column {key_name} with data: {data}"

Benefit: More context-aware, readable LLM output.

7. Additional Output/Log/Trace
Enhance: Push detailed typing, timing, and error logs into ctx or Logs/ for audit/performance monitoring, using framework’s ctx_logger, ctx_trace, or ctx_step_audit scriptlets.

Benefit: End-to-end traceability and reproducibility.

8. Progress/Status Callback
Enhance: Optionally write processing progress status to ctx["progress"] or issue events for Dash dashboards.

Benefit: Real-time UI integration for user awareness.

Example of an Enhanced Param for Parallel Calls
python
def run(ctx, params):
    import concurrent.futures
    keys = params["keys"]
    out = params["out"]
    prompt = params["prompt"]
    results = {}
    def call_llm(key):
        data = ctx[key]
        # ... standard LLM call logic ...
        return key, response_str
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        future_to_key = {executor.submit(call_llm, key): key for key in keys}
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(future_to_key):
            key, result = future.result()
            results[key] = result
    ctx[out] = results
    return {"summarized": keys}
Full implementation should comply with orchestrator’s error handling, logging, and ctx serializability standards.

Summary
ctx_llm_batch.py is an atomic, reusable scriptlet for orchestrating bulk LLM-processing on any collection of keys in your workflow.

Integrates seamlessly into orchestrator recipes, is compatible with the framework’s standards (independent CLI, detailed docstrings, JSON-serializability).

Can be extended safely for greater robustness, scalability, and flexibility—parallel processing and richer prompt management are highly recommended next steps.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_lazy_loader.py — Detailed Documentation
Objective
The purpose of ctx_lazy_loader.py is to efficiently load large datasets into the orchestrator’s shared in-memory context (ctx) only when needed. It supports chunked or summary loading, making it possible to manage very large files (e.g., Parquet files) without exhausting memory. This enables scalable data analysis, live dashboards, and smooth user experience regardless of data volume.

Description
ctx_lazy_loader.py is a core utility ("scriptlet") placed in scriptlets/python/core/.

It provides a Python function:

python
def run(ctx, params):
    ...
The function loads part or a summary of a large dataset (currently Parquet files via Pandas) into ctx, with optional chunk limits, and can also clear the loaded data.

It is designed for use in orchestrator recipe steps, Dash dashboard callbacks, or by other scriptlets.

Main workflow:

You declare what data you want (via params) and under which key (e.g. "big_data").

By specifying "chunk", you get only the first N rows to conserve memory.

You may call "clear" to free up memory.

Summary mode loads only the shape/columns for metadata/preview without the full content.

Dependencies
pandas (for loading Parquet files)

(by implication, Parquet I/O requires pyarrow or fastparquet—install via requirements.txt)

Python 3.6+

Orchestrator’s ctx API (must be called from runner or a compatible scriptlet)

Applications & Integration
In orchestration pipelines:

To delay (lazy-load) reading huge input files until actually needed for computation or dashboard use.

In Dash apps for loading only currently visible data ("virtualized" DataTables, paged or filtered charts, etc.).

Data science workflows where loading all rows is impractical, but summaries or samples are still useful for reporting, plotting, or quick exploration.

In integration:

Can be part of a multi-step recipe: preprocess → analyze → lazy load → visualize.

Can be triggered as a background thread/process for non-blocking UI.

Limitations
File format: Only supports Parquet input by default (can be easily extended to support CSV, JSON, etc.).

Memory management: Loads chunk into memory; it is up to the user/recipe to clear from ctx to prevent leaks.

Thread/process safety: Not inherently safe for multi-process changes to the same ctx key unless combined with file locking.

Functional scope: Filtering, advanced paging, schema conversion/validation, or live stream loading are not implemented.

No data transformation: Only loading/clearing; does not preprocess or transform data.

Usage Examples
1. Loading a Preview (Shape/Columns Only) into ctx
Suppose you have a huge Parquet file and want to show basic info in Dash before loading any heavy data:

python
params = {
    "key": "big_data_preview",
    "path": "Data/huge_file.parquet",
    "action": "load"
}
# Equivalent in YAML recipe
#   params:
#     key: big_data_preview
#     path: Data/huge_file.parquet
#     action: load

run(ctx, params)
# ctx["big_data_preview"] = {'shape': (1000000, 20), 'columns': ['col1', ...]}
2. Chunked Load: Read Only First N Rows
In a dashboard, load only 10,000 rows to display/paginate:

python
params = {
    "key": "big_data_chunk",
    "path": "Data/huge_file.parquet",
    "action": "load",
    "chunk": 10000
}
run(ctx, params)
# ctx["big_data_chunk"] is now a list of dicts, each a row
len(ctx["big_data_chunk"]) # == 10000 (at most)
3. Removing (Clearing) Data from ctx to Save Memory
python
params = {
    "key": "big_data_chunk",
    "action": "clear"
}
run(ctx, params)
# ctx.pop("big_data_chunk", None): safely frees this ctx key
4. CLI Example for Testing
You could wrap with a CLI for debugging, matching other scriptlets:

bash
python scriptlets/python/core/ctx_lazy_loader.py --key test --path Data/huge_file.parquet --chunk 1000
(implement CLI wrapper if needed, following standards)

5. In a Recipe Step (YAML Integration)
text
- idx: 2
  name: load_big_data_sample
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_lazy_loader
  function: run
  params:
    key: big_data
    path: Data/huge_file.parquet
    chunk: 50000
Loads 50,000 rows from Parquet into ctx["big_data"] just-in-time.

Recommendations & Suggestions for Enhancement
To comply with and enhance the orchestrator framework, consider the following expansion and best-practice tips:

1. Multi-format Support
Add optional support for CSV and JSON files, with a "format" param.

Example:

python
if fmt == "parquet":
    ...
elif fmt == "csv":
    df = pd.read_csv(path, nrows=chunk if chunk else None)
    ...
elif fmt == "json":
    ...
2. Filtering & Paging
Support "filters" and "page"/"page_size" parameters for server-side table paging (used in Dash).

Example:

python
"filter": {"column_name": "value"},
"page": 0,
"page_size": 1000
(Apply these after reading a chunk.)

3. Validation and Schema Enforcement
Optionally take a "schema" (dict) and check/transform loaded rows into the correct types/columns.

Raise exceptions or warning event into ctx on mismatch.

4. Error Handling and Logging
Integrate error handling with ctx_error_handler.py.

Report all exceptions as events or ctx["errors"], per the orchestrator’s robust paradigm.

5. Async/Background Load
Support "background": true param and use a thread/process to avoid blocking the orchestrator or Dash GUI.

6. Data Caching
Integrate a light cache (LRU) to avoid repeated expensive disk reads when requesting popular data slices.

Combine with ctx_cache.py pattern.

7. Unit Testing
Add (and document) a test in tests/ similar to other scriptlets.

8. CLI Entrypoint
Provide a CLI interface for direct invocation, like all compliant scriptlets (see ctx_init.py).

9. Comprehensive Documentation
Update the docstring at the top with:

Usage, description, params, CLI example(s), and limitations.

Examples showing multiple data types and filtering.

10. Support for Remote Files
Optional: Add support for remote file URLs, e.g., loading directly from S3, with optional download cache on disk.

Conclusion
ctx_lazy_loader.py is a core building block for scalable and efficient data workflows in the orchestrator framework. It empowers users to work with massive datasets without bottlenecks or memory pressure and enables best-practice live dashboards and paged data science flows. By extending its format support, filtering, chunk paging, schema validation, CLI, and background/async capabilities, it will seamlessly fit orchestrator’s vision: modular, composable, robust, and developer-friendly automation pipelines.

For maximal maintainability and forward compatibility, all enhancements should be additive, use only JSON-serializable objects, ensure robust logging and error handling, and follow the existing orchestrator scriptlet standards and directory structures.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_job_status.py Documentation
Objective
To query the status, result, or error of a background job that is managed and tracked in the orchestrator’s shared in-memory context (ctx).

To provide a standardized way for other steps, dashboards, or hooks to check if background jobs have finished, errored, or still running.

Description
ctx_job_status.py exposes a run(ctx, params) function.

Given a job ID, it looks up the corresponding job in ctx["jobs"] and returns:

Current status of the job (e.g., "running", "done", "error")

Result of the job (if available)

Error message (if status is "error")

This enables dynamic polling and progress checking of asynchronous or long-running jobs in automations, dashboards, notifications, or further steps.

Dependencies
No third-party dependencies: The script imports nothing except the global ctx dictionary.

Requires jobs to be tracked in ctx["jobs"], which is initialized and updated by orchestrator core or job-managing scriptlets (like ctx_bg_job.py, ctx_job_queue.py, and ctx_scheduler.py).

Application & Integration
Typical Use Cases
Python scriptlets, dashboards, or shell steps can call this scriptlet to:

Poll long-running data processes or ML training tasks.

Check if jobs for remote/distributed processing finished.

Drive dashboards (e.g., show spinner, update progress bar).

Trigger follow-up steps when jobs finish or error out.

Integration in Recipes
As a standalone Python step, or as a utility in custom Python scriptlets.

As a callback in Dash apps (e.g., interval polling).

Called by notification/alert mechanisms to trigger alerts on failures or completions.

Limitations
Can only check jobs that were registered/tracked in ctx["jobs"]; if the orchestrator or scriptlet didn't add a job, this scriptlet cannot track it.

Jobs must strictly follow the required structure in ctx["jobs"] (should contain at least status, result, and error keys as appropriate).

Only supports single-job lookup at a time (one job_id per call).

Only reads from context; does no actual job management, cleanup, or killing.

Does not validate the result/error schema, just returns its value.

If jobs are not unique or are overwritten, results may be unexpected.

Usage
Usage in Python
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_job_status

# Example 1: Query a running or finished job
ctx = {
    "jobs": {
        "job1": {"status": "running"},
        "job2": {"status": "done", "result": 42}
    }
}
print(ctx_job_status.run(ctx, {"job_id": "job2"}))
# Output: {"status": "done", "result": 42, "error": None}
Example: Waiting for Multiple Jobs
python
job_ids = ["job1", "job2"]
for jid in job_ids:
    status = ctx_job_status.run(ctx, {"job_id": jid})
    print(f"Job {jid} status: {status['status']}")
Example: Dash App Polling
python
import dash
from dash import dcc, html, Input, Output

from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_job_status

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div([
    dcc.Interval(id='poll', interval=2000, n_intervals=0),
    html.Div(id='status')
])

@app.callback(
    Output('status', 'children'),
    Input('poll', 'n_intervals')
)
def update_status(_):
    status = ctx_job_status.run(ctx, {"job_id": "job1"})
    return str(status)

# Assuming ctx["jobs"]["job1"] is being updated by another process/scriptlet.
Shell Usage (via a Python wrapper or CLI utility in a recipe step)
text
- name: check_my_job_status
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_job_status
  function: run
  params:
    job_id: "job1"
Example Output Scenarios
Job Running
python
ctx["jobs"] = {"job1": {"status": "running"}}
result = ctx_job_status.run(ctx, {"job_id": "job1"})
# Returns: {"status": "running", "result": None, "error": None}
Job Success
python
ctx["jobs"] = {"job2": {"status": "done", "result": {"output": 123}}}
result = ctx_job_status.run(ctx, {"job_id": "job2"})
# Returns: {"status": "done", "result": {"output": 123}, "error": None}
Job Error
python
ctx["jobs"] = {"job3": {"status": "error", "error": "FileNotFoundError"}}
result = ctx_job_status.run(ctx, {"job_id": "job3"})
# Returns: {"status": "error", "result": None, "error": "FileNotFoundError"}
Job Not Found
python
result = ctx_job_status.run(ctx, {"job_id": "does_not_exist"})
# Returns: {"error": "No such job"}
Recommendations & Suggestions for Enhancement
Tips for Using ctx_job_status.py
Consistency: Ensure that all job-managing scriptlets (background, queue, scheduler) use a consistent schema under ctx["jobs"].

Cleanup: After querying and handling a job, consider a cleanup workflow for old/completed jobs if the job list can grow.

Job Types: If jobs can be of different types, consider adding a "type" or "meta" field to the job dictionary for richer querying.

Suggestions for Expanding Capability
Batch Query Support:

Allow querying multiple job_ids at once, returning a dict of statuses.

Last N Jobs:

New parameter to return the statuses of the most recent N jobs.

Pattern Queries:

Allow querying all jobs matching a prefix, suffix, status, or regex.

Job “exists” Key:

Always include a key indicating whether the job exists.

Detailed Progress Reporting:

Standardize a "progress" field (e.g., 0-100%) for long jobs.

Expiration/Cleanup:

Add an option to remove completed/error jobs older than X minutes/hours.

Event/Callback Integration:

Option to trigger an event or callback/script when a job changes status (useful for dashboards).

Dash-Friendly Formatting:

Provide output in a table/plot-friendly format for direct visualization.

Example Enhanced API (Recommended)
python
def run(ctx, params):
    # params may contain "job_id" (str) OR "job_ids" (list) OR "pattern", plus "cleanup"
    # ...implement logic to return dict of multiple job statuses, cleanup if requested
Example: Pattern/Batch Query (API Proposal)
python
result = ctx_job_status.run(ctx, {"job_ids": ["job1", "job2", "job3"]})
# Returns:
# {
#   "job1": {"status": "running", ...},
#   "job2": {"status": "done", ...},
#   ...
# }
Conclusion
ctx_job_status.py is a critical inspection tool in orchestrator pipelines, dashboards, and automations that involve asynchronous or long-running jobs.

To best leverage it in your framework, expand its batch and pattern-matching abilities, and consider integration hooks for dashboard/event streaming.

Always ensure upstream job registration and structure are consistent for reliable status tracking and auditing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scriptlets/python/core/ctx_job_queue.py — Full Documentation
Objective
ctx_job_queue.py provides a simple, reusable, in-memory job queue for orchestrating multiple background jobs within the ctx-based orchestrator framework. Its purpose is to enable Python scriptlets to launch several independent tasks concurrently, each tracked by job ID inside the workflow’s shared ctx. This allows safe, non-blocking, and auditable orchestration of task parallelism inside a recipe.

Description
Parallel Execution: Schedules and runs multiple jobs as background threads using Python's threading library.

Status Tracking: Each job is tracked centrally in a ctx['jobs'] dictionary, keyed by a unique job_id.

Audit & Logging: Stores start, end timestamps, execution status (running, done, error), job results, and any uncaught exception messages.

Fault Tolerance: Errors encountered in an individual job are caught and logged to the job’s result for post-run analysis and debugging, while other jobs continue unaffected.

Extensible: Designed to be composable, reusable, and a building block for parallel or asynchronous flows in recipes and advanced dashboards.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+

Standard library:

threading

time

No third-party dependencies are required.

Applications & Integration
ctx_job_queue.py is ideal for parallelizing workloads in orchestrator recipes. It is particularly useful for:

Launching data processing, inference, or I/O jobs concurrently (e.g., batch data transformations, multiple ML predictions).

Triggering background notifications, logging, or resource collectors.

Managing jobs that periodically poll, monitor, or update ctx values.

Supporting interactive dashboards, where background calculations must not block the UI.

Common integration pattern:

Called via the runner/executor using run(ctx, params) in either a recipe step or within another scriptlet.

Used for launching multiple independent but tracked tasks.

Results can be consumed in later steps, visualized in Dash apps, or logged for auditability.

Limitations
Threading only: Jobs run as Python threads, which is good for I/O or lightweight tasks but not for CPU-bound workloads (due to the Global Interpreter Lock—see “Enhancements”).

In-memory only: All job and result tracking is in-memory in ctx. Restarting the process or step loses background job progress and results.

No persistence: No built-in checkpointing or disk-based queueing.

No cancellation: Once a job is started it can’t be cancelled or paused via this scriptlet.

No job dependencies: Jobs launched together are not aware of each other and scheduled in parallel.

No resource throttling: All jobs run immediately; no control for max concurrent threads.

No retries: Failing jobs are not retried automatically, but you can wrap their fn with a retry decorator if needed.

No process or remote/job-distributed execution: Not suited for heavy, CPU-bound, or remote-dispatched jobs (see Enhancements).

Usage
Basic Usage Example
1. Define functions to run as jobs:
python
def do_work_a(x):
    return x * 2

def do_work_b(text):
    return text.upper()
2. Use in a scriptlet or recipe step:
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_job_queue

ctx = {}
params = {
    "jobs": [
        {"job_id": "double", "fn": do_work_a, "args": {"x": 21}},
        {"job_id": "shout", "fn": do_work_b, "args": {"text": "hello"}}
    ]
}
result = ctx_job_queue.run(ctx, params)
print(result)  # {'queued': ['double', 'shout']}
3. Check job statuses and results:
After some time (jobs are running in the background!):

python
from time import sleep
sleep(0.5)
print(ctx['jobs']['double'])
# Example output: {'status': 'done', 'start': ..., 'result': 42, 'end': ...}

print(ctx['jobs']['shout'])
# Example output: {'status': 'done', 'start': ..., 'result': 'HELLO', 'end': ...}
4. Handling errors in jobs:
If a function throws an exception:

python
def bad_job():
    raise RuntimeError("Oops!")

params = {"jobs": [{"job_id": "bad", "fn": bad_job}]}
ctx_job_queue.run(ctx, params)
# Later:
# ctx['jobs']['bad'] =
# {'status': 'error', 'start': ..., 'error': 'Oops!', 'end': ...}
5. Integrate as a recipe step
YAML (in your orchestrator/recipes/…):

text
- idx: 2
  name: launch_jobs
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_job_queue
  function: run
  params:
    jobs:
      - job_id: query_temp
        fn: scriptlets.python.steps.temperature_query.query_sensor      # If imported function
        args: {'sensor_id': 'abc'}
      - job_id: summary_stats
        fn: scriptlets.python.steps.stats_calculator.run_stats
        args: {'data_key': 'raw_table'}
Note: Actual fn references in recipes require import-resolved functions if orchestrator supports it, else code the call within a custom Python wrapper scriptlet.

Advanced Example: Launch jobs and poll for completion
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_job_queue
import time

def wait_and_return(v, t=2):
    time.sleep(t)
    return v * 10

ctx = {}

# 3 background jobs
ctx_job_queue.run(ctx, {
    "jobs": [
        {"job_id": "fast", "fn": wait_and_return, "args": {"v": 1, "t": 0.5}},
        {"job_id": "med", "fn": wait_and_return, "args": {"v": 2, "t": 1}},
        {"job_id": "slow", "fn": wait_and_return, "args": {"v": 3, "t": 2}},
    ]
})

# Wait for jobs to end & check results
while any(job["status"] == "running" for job in ctx["jobs"].values()):
    print("Some jobs are still running...")
    time.sleep(0.2)

for job_id, rec in ctx["jobs"].items():
    print(f"Job {job_id} status: {rec['status']} result: {rec.get('result', rec.get('error'))}")
Recommendations, Tips, and Suggested Enhancements
1. Support for CPU-bound/Process jobs
Add an option to run jobs via the multiprocessing library for CPU-intensive tasks.

This can use a similar interface but swap threads for processes (like in ctx_parallel_process.py).

2. Job status callbacks/hook support
Allow for user-defined hooks/callbacks on job status change for dynamic UI or event triggering.

Example: Accept a callback key in each job definition.

3. Job cancellation & progress
Add the ability to cancel, pause, or resume jobs, per job_id.

Track job progress/completion percentage if underlying fn supports it.

4. Queue persistence/checkpointing
Periodically serialize the job status/results to disk for recovery and auditing.

5. Retry & error handling
Allow built-in retry policies for transient errors (e.g., configurable retries, delay, and exponential backoff per job).

6. Job dependencies
Allow specifying dependencies between jobs so some jobs can wait for others to complete before starting.

7. Resource control (throttling/concurrency limits)
Add a throttle option to limit the number of concurrent threads.

Implement a true queue for jobs and a fixed-size worker pool.

8. Remote/distributed job offload
Support dispatching jobs to remote services (Celery, Dask, HTTP job server).

Track remote execution status and result fetch.

9. UI/monitoring integration
Integrate with dashboards to show live updates of job states, results, errors, and runtime metrics.

10. Unit Tests and Validation
Provide tests covering normal jobs, exception handling, status transitions, and ctx traceability.

Validate complexity/edge cases and compatibility with orchestrator resume/restart.

Tips for Usage in Framework
Use ctx_job_queue for I/O-bound or lightweight parallel work, not CPU-bound heavy workloads.

For better auditability, always ensure job_id is unique in a run.

Always check job completion/status before consuming downstream results.

Chain with other scriptlets that summarize, aggregate, or retry/recover jobs as per workflow needs.

Document and test each job’s expected result and failure case for robust automation.

Summary
ctx_job_queue.py is a core building block for routine parallelization within the orchestrator. It aligns with best practices of your framework: composable, in-memory, audit-friendly, small, and highly reusable for scalable, testable, and debuggable workflow automation. With the above recommendations, it can power even more advanced parallel workflows—supporting everything from data science, automation, to real-time dashboards.

ctx_indexer.py
Located at: scriptlets/python/core/ctx_indexer.py

Objective
Enable fast, O(1) lookup for large datasets stored in the ctx shared in-memory context. Provides an efficient way to quickly access rows (or other records) in ctx[key] by a specified unique field, typically "id", "timestamp", or another unique property, by building and maintaining an index dictionary.

Description
This scriptlet creates an index (a Python dictionary mapping from key field value to the row index) over any list-of-dicts or list-of-lists data block in ctx.
The index is stored in ctx with the key pattern "{key}_index", making subsequent lookups and cross-referencing much faster than linear scans.

For example, if ctx["big_data"] is a list of dicts, you can build an index by "id":

python
run(ctx, {"key": "big_data", "index_by": "id"})
# This creates ctx["big_data_index"], a dict like: {<id_value>: <row_index>}
Dependencies
None outside of standard Python.
The code is entirely standalone and pure-Python; no third-party libraries required.

Application, Integration & Usage
Applications
Fast data access:
For dashboards, analysis, or scriptlets that repeatedly need to look up individual records by unique value.

Dash callbacks:
Used to efficiently respond to UI events that require “find by id” operations.

Data transformation:
Used as a supporting index for joining, merging, or correlating datasets.

Integration / Usage Examples
Basic indexing
Suppose you have data like:

python
ctx["records"] = [
  {"id": 101, "name": "Alice", "score": 92},
  {"id": 102, "name": "Bob", "score": 88},
  {"id": 103, "name": "Charlie", "score": 95},
]
Run indexer:

python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_indexer import run

run(ctx, {"key": "records", "index_by": "id"})
print(ctx["records_index"])
# Output: {101: 0, 102: 1, 103: 2}
Now, to quickly fetch Bob’s row:

python
bob_idx = ctx["records_index"][102]
bob_row = ctx["records"][bob_idx]
Using with list of lists
If your data is a list of lists, and the index column is at position 1 (e.g., timestamps):

python
ctx["ts_data"] = [
  ["2024-08-26T00:00:00", 1.0, 2.0],
  ["2024-08-26T01:00:00", 3.0, 4.0]
]
# Assume you write a wrapper mapping index_by to the position of the field
# This is NOT handled by the default ctx_indexer, see Limitations below
Within Orchestrator Recipe Step
Simple YAML integration, indexing by "id":

text
- name: build_index
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_indexer
  function: run
  params:
    key: records
    index_by: id
After this step, ctx["records_index"] is available to all downstream steps.

Limitations
Input must be a list of dicts.
The basic scriptlet expects ctx[key] to be a list of dicts, and index_by to be a key present in every dict.
It does not handle list-of-lists natively.

Index is for unique values.
If multiple rows share the same index_by value, only the last will be included. Non-unique keys will silently overwrite prior entries.

Static snapshot:
The index is not auto-updated if you mutate/add/delete rows in the underlying data after indexing.

No nested key support (can’t use "a.b.c" dotted keys).

No validation if index_by is missing from a row — this will raise a KeyError.

No reverse-lookup/index by value support.

Detailed Example Usage
Suppose you have a very large dataset and need to efficiently respond to “show details for item id=XYZ” in a web dashboard.

Step 1: Index the data

python
# Most common: build once after loading data
run(ctx, {"key": "user_activity", "index_by": "user_id"})
# ctx["user_activity_index"] will map user_id -> index into ctx["user_activity"]
Step 2: Retrieve

python
user_id = 99999
idx = ctx["user_activity_index"].get(user_id)
if idx is not None:
    details = ctx["user_activity"][idx]
else:
    details = None  # Not found
Step 3: Use in Dash callback

python
@app.callback(
    Output("user-details", "children"),
    [Input("user-id-dropdown", "value")]
)
def show_user_details(user_id):
    idx = ctx["user_activity_index"].get(user_id)
    if idx is not None:
        rec = ctx["user_activity"][idx]
        return f"Score: {rec['score']}, Last login: {rec['last_login']}"
    return "User not found"
Compliance and Best Practice Alignment
Keeps data JSON-serializable, working on primitives and lists/dicts.

No side effects—the only change is an additional key in ctx.

Small, focused, reusable: does one task extremely well (see “do one thing well” guideline in the README).

Tracability: can be logged as an explicit step in the recipe, with the resulting key for downstream trace.

Recommendations for Enhancement
Feature Enhancements
Support List-of-Lists with Column Name Mapping

Allow an optional parameter like header (a list) or index_by_pos to specify column position, e.g.:

python
run(ctx, {"key": "ts_data", "index_by_pos": 1})  # index by column 1
Or, if data is list of lists but a header is provided:

python
run(ctx, {"key": "ts_data", "header": ["ts", "val1", "id"], "index_by": "id"})
Auto-Update/Reactive Index

Provide a monitor mode or a utility to rebuild the index whenever ctx[key] changes (e.g., after each upstream step).

Or, supply a function like reindex_if_modified(ctx, key, index_by).

Support for Multi-value Index (non-unique)

Allow an option for a multi-map: if multiple rows have the same key, store a list of indices.

python
run(ctx, {"key": "sales", "index_by": "date", "multi": True})
# ctx["sales_index"]["2024-05-01"] = [7, 19, 42]
Custom Composite Keys

Support tuple keys, for example:

python
run(ctx, {"key": "events", "index_by": ["user", "date"]})
# ctx["events_index"][(user, date)] = idx
Index Health Check & Validation

Add an option to validate uniqueness and report duplicates or missing keys, with detailed errors or written to ctx["log"].

Framework-aligned Tips
CLI Mode: Provide a minimal CLI entrypoint for testing, e.g.:

text
python scriptlets/python/core/ctx_indexer.py --key data --index_by id
Extensive Docstring and Example at Top:
Follow the workspace convention for detailed docs with at least one YAML and CLI example.

Unit Tests:
Add a file in tests/ named test_ctx_indexer.py with non-trivial test cases including multi-key, list-of-lists, error cases, etc.

Standard Logging Hook:
Use a logging utility or append steps to ctx["log"] if present, recording each index creation and parameters.

Allow Re-indexing:
Add a param to force-rebuild the index, or skip if already present.

Compatibility:
Maintain backward-compatible signature and output—suggest adding new functionality as options or by extending via wrappers (do not break old code/recipes).

Summary
The ctx_indexer.py scriptlet is a core utility for efficient, scalable lookup in the orchestrator workspace, aligning with all workspace best practices for atomicity, reusability, serializability, and explicit traceability.
By adding multi-key, auto-update, and list-of-lists support, its power and generality for new data pipelines and interactive dashboards can be significantly enhanced while remaining fully backward-compatible and in harmony with the orchestrator framework philosophy.

ctx_history.py – Comprehensive Documentation
Objective
The purpose of ctx_history.py is to provide a robust mechanism for tracking and managing the historical changes of specific keys in the shared in-memory context object (ctx). This enables clear traceability, auditing, and the ability to review or revert data states at any granularity, empowering dashboards, reporting, debugging, and collaborative automation.

Description
ctx_history.py introduces an explicit history-tracking subsystem for chosen ctx keys. Unlike the default ctx (which only stores current values), this scriptlet maintains a chronological log of value changes for specified keys as a list of timestamped entries. This is particularly useful for viewing how data evolves over time, debugging pipeline steps, supporting visualization in dashboards, or auditing changes for compliance and reproducibility.

Key Features
Explicitly append ("track") new history entries to any ctx key.

Retrieve (get) the change history log for any managed ctx key.

All history entries include a precise Unix timestamp and the set value.

Isolated to keys tracked via this scriptlet; does not automatically hook into all ctx operations.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library:

time (for timestamps)

Framework:

Expects a dict-like ctx object, as defined in context.py

No third-party dependencies

Applications, Integrations & Usage Patterns
1. Dashboards
Visualize how metrics or key data series change step-by-step or in real time by showing time-series history.

2. Analytics & Auditing
Produce audit reports of value changes (e.g., for regulatory, process, or debugging requirements).

3. Automated Testing
Compare history logs before/after a recipe (unit-testing step output consistency).

4. Debugging
Investigate when and what data changed, helping pinpoint bugs or regressions.

5. Workflow Recovery
Support for rollbacks or undo operations by inspecting and restoring previous states.

API & Usage
Import
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_history import run
Parameters
ctx (dict-like): The shared context object.

params (dict):

key (str): The ctx key to manage.

action (str, optional): Can be "append" or "get" (default: "get").

value (any, required for "append"): The new value to be stored and logged.

How to Use
1. Append a new value to history and update ctx
python
# Suppose you want to record the result step by step
run(ctx, {"key": "temperature", "action": "append", "value": 34.21})
run(ctx, {"key": "temperature", "action": "append", "value": 34.55})
run(ctx, {"key": "temperature", "action": "append", "value": 34.10})
# After this, ctx["temperature"] == 34.10
2. Retrieve the history of any tracked key
python
history = run(ctx, {"key": "temperature", "action": "get"})
# history will be a list of:
# [{"timestamp": <float>, "value": 34.21}, ...]
3. Check All History Directly
The entry is also stored in

python
ctx["_history"]["temperature"]
# List of all previous appended values with timestamps
You may use this directly for deeper integrations.

4. Integrate with Dash
Render ctx history in table/graph form:

python
trace_entries = run(ctx, {"key": "some_metric", "action": "get"})
timestamps = [entry["timestamp"] for entry in trace_entries]
values = [entry["value"] for entry in trace_entries]
# Use for live or historical trend visualization
5. Auditing in Recipes
Add a step in the recipe after a calculation to log the output:

text
- name: audit_before_normalization
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_history
  function: run
  params:
    key: "raw_data"
    action: "append"
    value: "{{ ctx['raw_data'] }}"
Note: You may need a templating mechanism to inject the current value when running from a recipe.

6. Minimal Example as a Standalone
python
ctx = {}
run(ctx, {"key": "my_key", "action": "append", "value": 123})
run(ctx, {"key": "my_key", "action": "append", "value": 456})
print(run(ctx, {"key": "my_key", "action": "get"}))
# Output: [{'timestamp': ..., 'value': 123}, {'timestamp': ..., 'value': 456}]
API Summary Table
Action	Purpose	Required Params	Output	Description
append	Append value and update ctx[key]	key, value	{'history': list-of-dict}	Also updates ctx[key]
get	Get full history for ctx[key]	key	[{'timestamp', 'value'}, ...]	
Limitations
Manual: Only tracks keys that are explicitly managed via this scriptlet; does not intercept arbitrary ctx changes.

Not System-wide: Unlike the orchestrator’s own Context class history, this does not automatically log every ctx mutation—useful for selected/high-value keys.

No Branching, Versioning, or Rollback: Merely stores a linear log; does not directly support hooks for rollback, diff, or reference by snapshot.

No Pruning: Accumulates indefinitely; may grow large if used on high-frequency or large data. Implement pruning if needed.

Timestamps: Unix time (float); additional formatting for human readability may be needed.

Not thread-safe: As with most pure-Python dict/list objects, concurrent appends/retrievals are not locked.

Recommendations & Expansion Suggestions
Enhancement Suggestions (Framework-Compliant)
Automatic Hooks & Decorators

Integrate with the Context class so that every change to a selected key (or all keys if globally enabled) automatically logs to _history, without requiring explicit scriptlet invocation.

Provide @history_tracked decorator or ctx.enable_history("key") toggle.

Prune/Cap History

Add maxlen parameter to keep only the latest N history entries per key.

Add an action for pruning: run(ctx, {"key": "foo", "action": "prune", "maxlen": 100}).

Rollback/Restore Support

Add an action: run(ctx, {"key": "foo", "action": "restore", "index": -2}) to set ctx["foo"] to a previous value.

Enhanced Metadata in Entry

Permit who (step name/user), custom tags, or comments in each history entry (interfacing with step audit logging).

Time-based Query Support

Allow querying history over a specific time range: "get", "start_time", "end_time".

Rich Dash Integration

Add helper methods to export or format history as dataframes or for direct use in Dash DataTable and Graphs.

Thread Safety

Use threading locks for updates and reads if concurrent modification by different background/parallel pipeline threads is expected.

Snapshot & Versioning

Allow committing the current ctx or specific key history to disk, and reloading for offline analysis.

Schema and Type Enforcement

Optionally log type changes or schema evolutions in history, warning on unexpected types.

Best-Practices Tips
Use history tracking only for keys where change events are meaningful for monitoring, audit, or analysis—avoid high-granularity logging on bulk data.

Pair with audit and error logging for traceability: always log who (which step/function) made the change.

Clear old history on project restarts if not needed, to avoid unnecessary memory growth.

Expose key history from Dash or reporting endpoints to increase transparency for users and operators.

For critical steps, track key changes before and after each step to enable robust stepwise debugging.

Consider a global enable/disable toggle for history so as not to degrade performance during batch-heavy workflows.

Conclusion
ctx_history.py is a lightweight, composable, extensible utility for explicit ctx key change tracking in Orchestrator-based automation pipelines. With thoughtful integration (auto-hooks, pruning, rollback, richer metadata) it can serve as a foundation for advanced observability, debugging, and compliance—all in line with the robust, modular, and traceable philosophy of your automation framework.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for ctx_filter.py
Objective
The main objective of ctx_filter.py is to provide a generic, reusable utility for filtering keys in the shared in-memory context (ctx) based on either substring patterns or Python type. This enables downstream steps, dashboards, or scriptlets to easily find and operate on relevant data subsets without hard-coding key-names or structures.

Description
ctx_filter.py is a small, composable Python scriptlet that:

Accepts a filter pattern (substring) and / or Python type,

Searches all keys in the shared ctx object,

Produces a filtered list of keys that match,

Optionally writes the filtered result to a named ctx key (default: filtered_keys).

This enables dynamic workflows, letting recipes or Dash apps discover relevant context data at runtime, and facilitating composable automation steps.

Key Features:

Pattern matching (by substring).

Type matching (e.g., only keys where the value is a list or dict).

Optional output key selection (default: "filtered_keys").

Tiny, side-effect free, and highly reusable.

Code Reference
python
def run(ctx, params):
    pattern = params.get("pattern")
    typ = params.get("type")
    out = params.get("out", "filtered_keys")
    keys = [k for k in ctx if (not pattern or pattern in k) and (not typ or isinstance(ctx[k], typ))]
    ctx[out] = keys
    return {"filtered": out}
Dependencies
Python >= 3.6 (workspace minimum requirement)

Only uses Python standard library (no external modules)

Requires the orchestrator’s in-memory dict-like ctx object

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
ctx_filter.py can be used in recipes and Dash apps for:

Recipe Steps:
To dynamically select data for further processing, e.g.,

Process all keys containing 'sensor' and having type list.

Dash Interactive Apps:
To populate dropdowns/search for available datasets and support interactive user data exploration.

Pre-processing or Diagnostics:
To list all non-empty list-typed ctx keys, or locate all dicts for reporting.

Pipeline Modularity:
Used by other scriptlets as a preparatory step before processing/filtering multiple datasets.

Limitations
Type filtering requires a real Python type object, e.g., list or dict, not string type-names (see usage).

Filtering is performed at the key level only; it does not search within nested values

Only supports AND logic for pattern/type (not OR)

No support for regular expressions out-of-the-box (substring only)

Output is a list of matching keys, not the values themselves

Designed for in-memory, not persistent, filtering.

Cannot filter based on key-value pairs inside values (deep filtering)

Does not alter any keys or data, only produces a filtered key listing

Usage Examples
In a Recipe Step:

text
- name: filter_sensor_lists
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_filter
  function: run
  params:
    pattern: 'sensor'
    type: !!python/name:list ''
    out: 'sensor_lists'
As Python API in a Workflow:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_filter
filtered = ctx_filter.run(ctx, {"pattern": "csv"})
print(ctx["filtered_keys"])
Find All List-Typed ctx Keys (regardless of pattern):

text
- name: filter_lists
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_filter
  function: run
  params:
    type: !!python/name:list ''
    out: 'all_list_keys'
Find All Keys Containing "raw" and Type Dict:

python
ctx_filter.run(ctx, {"pattern": "raw", "type": dict, "out": "raw_dict_keys"})
Default Output Key:

If you omit "out", the result is written to ctx["filtered_keys"]:

python
ctx_filter.run(ctx, {"pattern": "foo"})
print(ctx["filtered_keys"])
Usage in Dash Callback for a Dropdown
python
options = [{"label": k, "value": k} for k in ctx.get("filtered_keys", [])]
dropdown = dcc.Dropdown(options=options)
YAML Usage with Both Filters
text
- name: select_metric_lists
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_filter
  function: run
  params:
    pattern: 'metric'
    type: !!python/name:list ''
Type Notes for YAML
Most YAML parsers for orchestrator will allow:

For list type: !!python/name:list ''

For dict type: !!python/name:dict ''

Alternatively, you may add a tiny wrapper for string type-resolving if you want to pass type as a string.

Recommendations and Expansion Tips
To expand capability and ensure further compliance and power within this framework, consider the following enhancements:

1. Support for Regular Expressions
Add a new param like regex: "pattern" and fall back to re.search.

Increases precision for advanced filtering.

2. OR/Combined Filters
Allow filtering with OR logic, or combining multiple patterns/types.

3. Support for Nested/Deep Filtering
Option to search recursively inside dicts or lists for keys/values matching the pattern or type.

4. Filter by Value
Optional param to filter not just keys, but keys whose values satisfy a function (e.g., length, value threshold).

5. Key Exclude/Include/Blacklisting
Exclude keys matching a pattern/type as an additional feature.

6. Sorting and Deduplication
Add sorting (e.g., alphabetically, by value length) or deduplication (in case of complex key mangling).

7. Flexible Output
Return values instead of just keys, e.g., {key: ctx[key] for key in keys} or a tuple/list of (key, value).

8. Shell Integration
Export filtered keys as a set of environment variables for downstream shell scriptlets.

9. Verbose Logging/Traceability
Log filtering criteria, results count, output destination to ctx["log"] for audit and debugging purposes.

10. Extensible Filtering Functions
Allow passing arbitrary callables or limited lambda expressions (with careful serialization/sandbox).

Tips for Code and Documentation Compliance
Always include a full multiline docstring with usage, limitation, and dependency sections at the top of the scriptlet.

Ensure all added enhancements remain independent (do not break existing run(ctx, params) signature).

Log all changes or important filtering steps to ctx["log"], especially in debug mode.

Add integration and unit tests (tests/test_ctx_filter.py) for each common and edge case usage.

If extending with advanced matchers (regex/callables), document security considerations for untrusted patterns/callables.

Example Docstring for the Enhanced Version
python
"""
ctx_filter.py
-------------
Filters ctx keys by pattern, type, and (optionally) value or regex.

Usage:
    run(ctx, {"pattern": "foo", "type": list, "regex": "^foo.*$", "out": "foo_keys"})

Description:
    - Stores matching keys in ctx[out].
    - Supports substring, regex, type, and value filtering.

Limitations:
    - Advanced filters may require additional dependencies/validation.
"""
In summary:
ctx_filter.py is a light, composable utility for context key discovery. Expanding it carefully with regex, value, and deep filtering—while keeping it backwards compatible and traceable—will make it even more powerful in orchestrator workflows.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detailed Documentation for ctx_file_lock.py
Objective
To provide a safe and atomic file locking mechanism for scripts and orchestrator steps that need to read or write shared files (such as context snapshots, data, or logs) in a multi-process or multi-threaded environment.
This scriptlet helps prevent file corruption and race conditions during concurrent access by locking files exclusively for the duration of critical operations.

Description
ctx_file_lock.py implements a context manager using fcntl.flock (POSIX advisory file locks) for atomic access to files within the orchestrator automation framework.

How it works:
Atomic Locking:
When you want to read/write (or update) a file, use the context manager from ctx_file_lock.py.
This will automatically place an exclusive lock on the file so that only one process/thread can modify it at a time.

Safe With:
Any operation that involves shared files—often used for intermediate outputs, ctx snapshots, state pickles, logs, and concurrently updated metrics/data.

POSIX-Only:
Relies on UNIX-style file locks (not natively available on Windows)—intended for Linux/Mac environments.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+

Standard library

fcntl (file control & locking; POSIX-only)

contextlib.contextmanager (used to create context manager with with statement)

Limitations
UNIX Only:
Uses fcntl, so it won’t work on Windows or other non-POSIX OS without significant changes.

Advisory Locks:
File locking is advisory—other processes must also use fcntl/appropriate mechanisms to cooperate.
If another process ignores file locks (does not use ctx_file_lock.py or fcntl), conflicts can still occur.

Single-file Scope:
Locks only one file per invocation. No "multi-file" lock or atomic group operation.

No Timeout/Deadlock Handling:
If a process crashes while holding a lock, underlying OS will release on file closure.
No built-in timeout/retry for lost/stuck locks (could be added).

Blocking Only:
Current implementation will block until the lock is obtained (if another process is holding it). No non-blocking or timeout option by default.

Application & Integration
Where and how you should use ctx_file_lock.py:

Step Scripts (Python/CLI):

Before loading/dumping JSON/CSV files that are shared between steps.

When appending or updating logs/metrics from multiple threads or processes.

For saving checkpoints, snapshots, or state pickle files.

Integration Examples With Other Scriptlets:

Combine with context snapshot, audit log, or results data for file integrity.

Use when scheduling steps that could overlap (concurrent runners, manual runs, background jobs).

Design pattern:

python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_file_lock import file_lock

# Safely read/write a shared file
with file_lock("Data/shared.json"):
    # ...safe read or write...
    with open("Data/shared.json") as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    # [modify data, e.g., add row]
    with open("Data/shared.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f)
Example Usages
1. Safely Updating a Shared JSON File
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_file_lock import file_lock
import json

with file_lock("Data/counters.json"):
    with open("Data/counters.json") as f:
        counters = json.load(f)
    counters["task"] += 1
    with open("Data/counters.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(counters, f)
2. Saving a Context Snapshot With File Lock
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_file_lock import file_lock
import json

def save_ctx_snapshot(ctx):
    snapshot_path = "Data/ctx_snapshot.json"
    with file_lock(snapshot_path):
        with open(snapshot_path, "w") as f:
            json.dump(dict(ctx), f, indent=2)
3. Using in a Custom Workflow Step
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_file_lock import file_lock
import csv

def append_row_safe(path, row):
    with file_lock(path):
        with open(path, "a", newline="") as f:
            writer = csv.writer(f)
            writer.writerow(row)
4. Asynchronous/Parallel Steps
Background writer thread:

python
import threading

def writer():
    for i in range(100):
        with file_lock("Data/concurrent.txt"):
            with open("Data/concurrent.txt", "a") as f:
                f.write(str(i) + "\n")
t = threading.Thread(target=writer)
t.start()
5. With Error Handling
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_file_lock import file_lock

try:
    with file_lock("Data/protected.txt"):
        # work...
        pass
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Locking or file operation failed: {e}")
Recommendation Section – Future Expansions & Enhancements
1. Add Timeout Support for Locks
Currently, the lock blocks indefinitely.

Adding parameters for "timeout" or "max_wait" would allow a graceful fail if the lock is not acquired in a reasonable time.

2. Cross-Platform Support
On Windows, could use msvcrt.locking or a third-party cross-platform locking library such as portalocker.

3. Non-blocking Mode
Allow the API to optionally try-acquire the lock and exit/fail if not available.

Use-case: background monitoring steps, polling for file updates.

4. Logging and Debug Hooks
Integrate logging: log lock acquisition/release times for troubleshooting slow pipeline steps.

5. Lock Scope Expansion
Support atomic locking of multiple files (batched atomic updates), possibly via resource ordering to avoid deadlocks.

6. Lock Metadata for Auditing
Optionally record:

Who acquired the lock (process/thread/step ID)

How long each lock is held (timing stats)

Last modification reason (e.g., via CI step/job)

7. Decorator for Step Functions
Provide a decorator for step logic so that “file_lock(path)” wrapping is enforced automatically for file-modifying steps.

python
def filelock_step(path):
    def decorator(fn):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            with file_lock(path):
                return fn(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@filelock_step("Data/shared.json")
def safe_ctx_update(ctx):
    ...
8. Exception Enhancement
Raise custom exceptions for lock errors, such as FileLockAcquisitionError, and provide troubleshooting/hints if lock acquisition fails.

9. Enhanced Context Integration
When using with orchestrator’s Context, optionally record in ctx the time, location, and job that acquired the lock, aiding traceability.

10. Lint and Recipe Checks
Add linter/hook to recipe creation. Recipes that read/write shared files should be flagged if not using lock protection.

Summary
ctx_file_lock.py is vital for atomic, safe file operations in concurrent automation pipelines. By providing a simple context manager for file locks, it ensures data and state consistency—essential for reliability, especially with shared ctx/state files.
The foundational implementation is robust for UNIX but can be expanded for broader orchestration needs (timeouts, cross-platform, richer auditing, batched locks, etc.) as projects scale and as concurrency and performance demands increase. Adhering to the best practices outlined throughout your workspace, all enhancements should retain scriptlet modularity, testability, and backward compatibility.

ctx_excel.py – Documentation & Recommendations
Objective
Primary Goal:
To export data residing in the orchestrator’s shared context (ctx) into Excel files for reporting, analysis, or sharing with other systems.

Secondary Goals:
Enable multi-sheet output, include charts of various types, and be easily callable as a modular, reusable step inside orchestrator pipelines or as a standalone scriptlet.

Description
ctx_excel.py is a Python scriptlet found under scriptlets/python/core/ designed for the Orchestrator automation framework.
It writes one or more keys (from the shared ctx dictionary) as sheets in a single Excel .xlsx output file. It supports:

Multi-key (multi-sheet):
Map any ctx key to a distinctive Excel sheet.

Flexible data format:
Each key may be a list of lists (rows) or a list of dicts (table).

Basic Charting:
Optionally, line charts (and, by extension, bar charts) can be added to any sheet, displaying selected columns.

Design:

Leverages openpyxl for Excel writing and chart insertion.

Parameters specify which ctx keys to write, sheet names, output file location, and optional chart details.

Intended to be called by the orchestrator's runner (from recipe YAML/step) or run directly as a function.

Dependencies
Python ≥3.6 (annotations, dict ordering)

openpyxl for reading, writing, and charting Excel files

text
pip install openpyxl==3.1.5
Standard Library:

typing (for type hints)

Shared ctx structure:
Relies on data populated in the orchestrator context, as per framework requirements.

Applications & Integration
Where and How to Use:

Inside Recipes:
As a Python step in orchestrator recipes to automate the export of test results, metrics, logs, or AI-generated summaries to Excel after a process or test sequence.

Standalone Usage:
As a utility for any workflow that needs Excel export from a Python dictionary/list.

Live Dashboard Export:
Combine with a Dash dashboard for downloadable data visualization and reporting.

Example Integration (YAML step):

text
- idx: 7
  name: export_excel_report
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_excel
  function: run
  params:
    sheets:
      metrics: Results
      ai_summary: Summary
    out: Data/output.xlsx
    charts:
      - sheet: Results
        x: Time
        y: [Temperature, Power]
Limitations
Supported Data Types:
Only lists (of lists or dicts) are supported for export. Complex/nested structures may fail or flatten incorrectly.

No Formatting Customization:
Lacks fine-grained cell formatting (colors, font, conditional, etc.)

Chart Type Limited:
Only line and bar charts are supported via openpyxl's chart objects.

No Error Handling for Missing Data:
User must ensure requested keys and columns exist and are serializable.

Scalability:
For very large datasets, memory and performance may be affected due to in-memory writes.

No Excel File Read/Update:
Only writes new files; cannot append, update, or read/modify an existing Excel file.

No Cross-linking or Formulas:
Does not auto-generate links or formulas between sheets.

Usage
A. Minimal Example – Single Sheet
Write a context list of lists to a single Excel sheet:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_excel

ctx = {}
ctx["test_data"] = [
    ["Time", "Value1", "Value2"],
    ["2024-08-26T08:01", 42.3, 14.1],
    ["2024-08-26T08:02", 44.2, 15.3],
]

ctx_excel.run(ctx, {
    "sheets": {"test_data": "Sheet1"},
    "out": "Data/report.xlsx"
})
This produces Data/report.xlsx with one sheet "Sheet1" containing your table.

B. Multiple Sheets, List of Dicts
python
ctx["summary"] = [
    {"Phase": "Init", "Status": "OK"},
    {"Phase": "Test", "Status": "FAIL"}
]
ctx["numbers"] = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]

ctx_excel.run(ctx, {
    "sheets": {"summary": "Summary", "numbers": "Numbers"},
    "out": "Data/sample.xlsx"
})
C. Adding a Line Chart
Suppose metrics is a list of dicts (with "Time", "Temperature", "Power" as columns):

python
ctx["metrics"] = [
    {"Time": "2024-08-26T08:00", "Temperature": 25.2, "Power": 10.1},
    {"Time": "2024-08-26T08:01", "Temperature": 26.1, "Power": 10.4},
    # ...
]

ctx_excel.run(ctx, {
    "sheets": {"metrics": "Results"},
    "out": "Data/with_chart.xlsx",
    "charts": [
        {"sheet": "Results", "x": "Time", "y": ["Temperature", "Power"], "type": "line"}
    ]
})
This adds a line chart visualizing "Temperature" and "Power" vs "Time" in the "Results" sheet.

D. Add a Bar Chart (Explicitly)
python
ctx_excel.run(ctx, {
    "sheets": {"metrics": "Metrics"},
    "out": "Data/bar_chart.xlsx",
    "charts": [
        {"sheet": "Metrics", "x": "Time", "y": ["Power"], "type": "bar"}
    ]
})
E. Integration as a CLI Helper (Pseudo-code)
Scriptlet code allows its function to be called from any orchestrator workflow step definition:

text
- idx: 10
  name: write_metrics_excel
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_excel
  function: run
  params:
    sheets:
      test_results: ResultSheet
    out: Data/test_results.xlsx
Recommendations & Suggestions for Enhancement
1. Error Handling & User Feedback
Add explicit error catching for:

Nonexistent keys.

Data that isn’t a list of lists/dicts, or missing headers.

Out-of-range columns for chart axes.

Return detailed messages and write user-friendly logs on step failure.

2. Formatting Features
Allow passing options for:

Header/bold styling, conditional formatting, cell coloring, column width.

Support sheet-level and cell-level formatting parameters in _params.

3. Charting Improvements
Enable other chart types (scatter, pie, area) by allowing a type parameter beyond just "line"/"bar".

Support multiple chart objects per sheet and their layout location (cell address).

Allow selection of data by column index, not just by header.

4. File Save Flexibility
Support file overwrite confirmation, append mode, and loading existing Excel files to add/merge new sheets.

Option to remove default sheet without fail if not present.

5. Large Dataset Handling
Option to write very large rows as streaming (batch-wise) if supported by openpyxl or via CSV fallback.

6. File Read-Back
Add a companion utility for reading .xlsx files back into ctx (for feedback, audit, round-trip, or previous-step input).

7. Documentation & Discoverability
Add a CLI wrapper or --help entry to print usage from shell (perhaps via argparse).

Auto-document all available sheet/chart options for framework help menus.

8. Testing & Validation
Add pytest/unit tests for:

All supported export types (lists, dicts).

Error and edge cases.

Chart options generation.

9. Recipe Schema & Validation
Validate required sheets/out arguments at run time.

Optionally, provide a dry-run mode that only validates params/input structure.

10. Scripting & Modularization
Extract low-level helpers (row-to-sheet, dict-to-table, chart-builder) into reusable framework utilities under scriptlets/python/core/.

Tips for Expansion within Framework Compliance
Always require JSON-serializability of ctx content.

Keep sheet-writing code atomic and reusable.
E.g., one function per sheet, per chart type, etc.

Document new options and behavior at the top as a docstring, updating the help and README as functionality grows.

When adding features, always maintain backward compatibility.
Deprecate rather than replace parameter names whenever possible.

Provide examples for every new feature directly in docstring and in tests/recipes.

If introducing additional dependencies (pandas, xlsxwriter, etc.), update requirements.txt and add documentation.

Use standard orchestrator mechanisms for logging, exceptions, and result reporting for full traceability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File: scriptlets/python/core/ctx_excel_advanced.py
Objective
To export one or multiple ctx keys (datasets) into an Excel file with each key as a separate worksheet, with support for writing headers, arbitrary data shapes, and inserting charts (line, bar) with optional labels and formatting.

Designed for flexible, advanced reporting and sharing of any context data in the Orchestrator pipeline, especially when visual or tabular outputs are needed for reporting, QA, or audit.

Description
This scriptlet automates the process of writing context data (ctx keys) to an Excel file, each as a different sheet, optionally adding charts, with significant flexibility for structuring reports:

Multiple ctx keys can be written as sheets. Each key's content appears as a worksheet named as mapped in the sheets parameter.

Each worksheet supports:

Data as a list of lists (raw rows), or list of dicts (records with named columns).

If data is a list of dicts, headers are auto-written.

Charts (line or bar) may be added:

Chart specs can define which sheet, which columns (X and Y), and chart type.

Multiple Y columns supported, each as separate chart trace/series.

Created with OpenPyXL, so resulting files are standard .xlsx, usable in Excel/LibreOffice/etc.

Supports basic formatting via OpenPyXL (can be extended).

All parameters are JSON-serializable for compatibility with the orchestrator’s shared context standard.

Return value: Basic JSON indicating success and written file name.

Dependencies
Python ≥ 3.6

openpyxl (requirements.txt specifies version openpyxl==3.1.5)

Standard os and typing libraries (for advanced extension)

Must be imported and called with run(ctx, params) via orchestrator recipe or CLI for full feature set.

Applications and Integration
Export results or intermediate data for QA, sharing, user review, archival, or presentation.

Create multi-sheet reports from test pipelines—for example, raw data, processed data, and summary analytics in one file.

Add automated charting to Excel output for validation, reporting, or even live dashboards using other tools.

Automate result packaging: Insert output step in any recipe after data processing stages.

Can be called from other scriptlets to batch-report multiple datasets as deliverable, or after batch runs for reporting.

Usage
1. Basic Example: Write List of Lists to Excel
Suppose ctx["metrics"] and ctx["ai_summary"] are each [ [row1], [row2], ... ]:

python
ctx = {
    "metrics": [
        ["Temp", "Value"],
        [25, 99],
        [26, 101]
    ],
    "ai_summary": [
        ["Step", "Score"],
        ["prep", 0.92],
        ["test", 0.81]
    ]
}
params = {
    "sheets": {"metrics": "Metrics", "ai_summary": "Summary"},
    "out": "Data/all_results.xlsx"
}
run(ctx, params)
This creates Data/all_results.xlsx with two sheets: Metrics and Summary.

2. Auto-header Support for List of Dicts
Suppose ctx["data"] = [{"A": 1, "B": 2}, {"A": 3, "B": 4}]:

python
params = {
    "sheets": {"data": "Sheet1"},
    "out": "Data/auto_headers.xlsx"
}
run(ctx, params)
Sheet1 will have columns A and B as headers, and rows below.

3. Add a Chart to a Worksheet
Suppose you want to show "Value" versus "Temp" as a line chart on Metrics sheet:

python
params = {
    "sheets": {"metrics": "Metrics"},
    "out": "Data/metrics_report.xlsx",
    "charts": [
        {"sheet": "Metrics", "x": "Temp", "y": ["Value"], "type": "line"}
    ]
}
run(ctx, params)
Adds a line chart to Metrics showing Value vs Temp.

4. Multiple Charts, Multi-Sheet Write
python
params = {
    "sheets": {"metrics": "TestMetrics", "summary": "Analysis"},
    "out": "Data/multi_charts.xlsx",
    "charts": [
        {"sheet": "TestMetrics", "x": "Temp", "y": ["Value1", "Value2"], "type": "line"},
        {"sheet": "Analysis", "x": "Step", "y": ["Score"], "type": "bar"}
    ]
}
run(ctx, params)
5. With a Recipe Step (YAML)
text
- name: export_results
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_excel_advanced
  function: run
  params:
    sheets:
      metrics: "Results"
      meta: "Metadata"
    out: "Data/final_report.xlsx"
    charts:
      - sheet: "Results"
        x: "Temp"
        y: ["Value"]
        type: "line"
6. Command-line Test (CLI)
To enable this, wrap with an entry point:

bash
python scriptlets/python/core/ctx_excel_advanced.py --sheets metrics:Metrics ai_summary:Summary --out Data/all_results.xlsx
(You may add such a CLI wrapper for debugging.)

Limitations
Excel size limit—OpenPyXL and Excel have practical limits (~1M rows per sheet).

Charts: Only line and bar supported; more complex charts require extension.

Column auto-detection: List-of-dicts must have consistent keys; list-of-lists must be regular.

Formatting: Only minimal default formatting. For advanced styling (colors, cell format), extend manually.

No formula support—all data is static at export.

No direct reading/overwrite protection—existing files will be overwritten.

File path must exist/parent directory must be present.

All ctx keys must be JSON-serializable.

No validation on ‘sheets’ or ‘charts’ fields; user is responsible for correct mapping.

No built-in error on missing ctx key/sheet; file will omit empty/missing data.

Best Practices and Integration Tips
Always ensure all required data is present in ctx before running this scriptlet.

For new recipes, place before any archiving, notification, or report-distribution step.

Verify generated Excel output using openpyxl (Python) or by opening in Excel/LibreOffice.

Recommendations & Expansion Suggestions
To enhance ctx_excel_advanced.py and ensure compliance and utility for Orchestrator framework:

A. Feature Upgrades
Support for additional chart types: Pie, scatter, area, or combo charts.

Allow users to specify chart positions (cell locations: e.g., “F10”).

Advanced formatting options: Fonts, styles, conditional format, merged cells.

Formulas: Allow inserting Excel formulas for post-processing or derived columns.

Dynamic header mapping: User can override column headers or provide alias mapping.

Sheet protection/locking: Make certain sheets readonly or locked for editing.

Append mode: Optionally append sheets to an existing workbook rather than overwrite.

B. Robustness and Validation
Add schema validation for sheets and chart specifications with clear error reporting if keys/columns are missing.

Automatic directory/file creation if output folders do not exist.

Type-checking: Ensure data shape/keys are compatible before writing.

Provide richer summary/error messages in the return dict.

Develop accompanying unit tests for common use cases.

C. Framework-wide Integration
Logging: Log every successful file write and chart insert for traceability/audit.

Profiler hooks: Time performance for very large outputs.

Event emission: Signal "ExcelExportCompleted" event for dashboards or webhooks.

Cross-compatibility: Write compatible CSV sheets as a fallback for legacy systems.

D. Best Practice Compliance
Place detailed docstring at the top—with usage/limitations and YAML examples (see above).

Write CLI entry-point wrapper for debug/test runs outside orchestrator runner.

All enhancements should be backward compatible (no breaking changes for prior YAML or Python usage).

Only allow JSON-serializable data; throw descriptive errors otherwise.

Maintain per-sheet, per-chart documentation in inline comments for future contributors.

Summary Table
Capability	Supported	Recommended Upgrade
Multi-sheet support	Yes	✔
List-of-lists & dicts	Yes	✔
Line/Bar chart	Yes	More types (pie, scatter, combo)
Formatting	Minimal	Font/color/cell merging/conditional-format
Column mapping/alias	No	Add option to map headers or provide column aliases
Appending to file	No	Add append vs. overwrite switch
Error handling/logging	Minimal	Add logging and validation
CLI invocation	Not standard	Add CLI parser for debugging
This documentation embodies both the intent and extensibility of the Orchestrator framework. By expanding ctx_excel_advanced.py as above, you ensure powerful, future-proof, and maintainable Excel outputs for any pipeline!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_event_bus_advanced.py — Advanced Event Bus for Distributed Orchestration
Objective
To enable distributed, asynchronous, and decoupled event-driven workflows within the orchestrator automation framework.

To provide publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging across processes or machines using a robust external message broker (e.g., Redis).

To allow scriptlets, Dash apps, or external services to publish, subscribe, and react to orchestration events for scalable automation, real-time dashboards, and fault-tolerant control.

Description
ctx_event_bus_advanced.py serves as an advanced event bus facility, leveraging distributed message brokers (currently uses Redis via redis-py) to propagate events among orchestrator steps, dashboards, and other processes or machines.

Publishing events:
Any step or service can trigger an event, optionally with a JSON payload, that is broadcast to all subscribers.

Subscribing to events:
Listeners can block/wait for events, react immediately when an event fires, or poll for new events and respond in code.

Pattern of use:
Enables “fire & forget” triggers (for background tasks, notifications, state changes), centralized event logging/auditing, and coordination between independent workflow components—even distributed in different environments.

Supported Actions/Arguments:

action: publish — Immediately publishes an event+payload to the broker.

action: subscribe — Blocks/waits for the specified event, then writes received payload to ctx.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+

redis-py (i.e., pip install redis)

A running Redis server, or compatible broker supporting pub/sub semantics.

The orchestrator’s shared ctx structure (dict-like context object).

Applications & Integration
A. Pipeline-to-Pipeline Triggers

One recipe publishes an event (“data_ready”) after a step—another workflow, on the same or remote machine, subscribes and proceeds only when event is received.

B. Real-Time Dashboards

Dash or other apps can subscribe to “data_updated” events to automatically refresh visualizations or alert the user without polling.

C. Distributed Testing or Automation

Jobs launched across multiple nodes can signal status, errors, or results centrally for aggregation/monitoring.

D. Orchestrator Step Notifications

Automated notifications (via slack/email) on event fires (e.g., job errors, completion), trigger escalations, restart routines, or context rollbacks.

Limitations
Supports Redis only by default but could be adapted for other brokers.

Subscription is a blocking call—the subscribing step will not return until the event fires (non-blocking or polling subscription requires further adaptation).

Message payloads must be JSON-serializable—no raw python objects, open files, etc.

No security/authentication—it is expected that the Redis instance is secured or in a trusted network.

Not designed for persistent event storage—aimed at real-time or near-real-time event propagation.

Does not implement event queues or retries (use broker features for guaranteed delivery or retry policies).

Usage
Basic Publish Example
python
# Publish an event named "test_completed" with results
run(ctx, {
    "action": "publish",
    "event": "test_completed",
    "payload": {"test_id": "abc123", "status": "success", "summary": "All OK."},
    "broker_url": "redis://localhost:6379/0"
})
Result: All subscribers to 'test_completed' will immediately receive the payload.

Basic Subscribe Example
python
# Subscribe to a 'test_completed' event, capture data into ctx["event_test_completed"]
run(ctx, {
    "action": "subscribe",
    "event": "test_completed",
    "broker_url": "redis://localhost:6379/0"
})
# ctx["event_test_completed"] now contains {"test_id": "...", "status": "..."}
Advanced Orchestrator Integration Example
1. Step to notify Dash dashboard when new data is loaded:

text
- name: publish_data_ready
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_event_bus_advanced
  function: run
  params:
    action: publish
    event: data_ready
    payload:
      source: "pipeline1"
      details: "metrics generated"
    broker_url: "redis://localhost:6379/0"
2. Dash app step to subscribe for update triggers:

text
- name: wait_for_data_ready
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_event_bus_advanced
  function: run
  params:
    action: subscribe
    event: data_ready
    broker_url: "redis://localhost:6379/0"
Hybrid Pattern Example: Fan-Out
You can have multiple subscribers to a central event:

All test nodes subscribe to "run_now" event and start their flow when the control center publishes.

All dashboards subscribe to "metrics_available" and automatically refresh charts when notified.

Multiple Event Types and Payloads
The value of event is arbitrary, string-typed and can be any event name.

The payload can be any dict, but must serialize as JSON:

python
"payload": {
    "step": "analyze",
    "result": {"mean": 2.1, "stdev": 0.7},
    "timestamp": "2025-08-25T12:00:00"
}
Sample Code-only Invocation
python
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_event_bus_advanced as eventbus

# Publish an event
eventbus.run(ctx, {
    "action": "publish",
    "event": "step_done",
    "payload": {"foo": 1},
    "broker_url": "redis://localhost:6379/0"
})

# Wait for an event with a blocking subscribe
eventbus.run(ctx, {
    "action": "subscribe",
    "event": "step_done",
    "broker_url": "redis://localhost:6379/0"
})
result = ctx.get("event_step_done")   # Contains payload when event fires
Example YAML for a Recipe
text
- idx: 7
  name: notify_completion
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_event_bus_advanced
  function: run
  params:
    action: publish
    event: job_complete
    payload:
      job_id: "J42"
      status: "ok"
    broker_url: "redis://localhost:6379/0"
Enhancement Recommendations & Tips
A. General Tips for Use
Standardize event names and payload structure across your team (“data_ready”, “job_error”, etc.).

Document which step publishes and which subscribes in your recipes for traceability.

Use complex event payloads to carry as much metadata as needed for downstream consumption (step source, timestamp, error details...).

B. Feature Expansion Recommendations
1. Support for Multiple Brokers/Backends

Add modular support for other brokers (RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, cloud pubsub, etc.) via a plug-in backend system.

2. Non-Blocking and Async Subscriptions

Implement a polling or callback-based API so subscriptions step can continue instead of blocking indefinitely.

3. Event Persistence, Replay & Audit

Add optional event logging (write all events to Data/events.log) for replay/audit/debug purposes.

4. Channels and Patterns

Allow wildcard subscribe (i.e., listen to all “data_*” events) for flexible aggregation and dashboards.

5. Event Authentication/Security

Integrate Redis ACLs, or token-based auth, for broader distributed security.

6. Expiry, Delivery Guarantee & Retry Logic

Integrate broker’s message durability and expiry settings as parameter options; add retry or backoff for subscribers that may drop.

7. CLI Example Utility

Provide a shell scriptlet or Python CLI wrapper to publish/subscribe to events from the command line for rapid debug/testing.

8. Enhanced Error Handling

Add timeout and exception management (e.g., fail with clear ctx["error"] status if broker is unreachable, or subscription times out).

9. Richer Pub/Sub API

Allow subscription to multiple events at once, and publication of event batches in one call.

Example: Enhanced Usage Proposal
python
# Subscribe with a timeout and wildcard support (future version suggestion)
run(ctx, {
    "action": "subscribe",
    "event": "job_*",            # wildcard pattern
    "timeout_sec": 30,
    "broker_url": "redis://..."
})
# returns in 30 sec or when any matching event is fired
Limitations and Conformance Tips
Single responsibility: Keep logic for event encoding/decoding, error handling, etc. modular—do NOT mix orchestrator business logic with core event bus.

Testability: Make the event bus easily mockable for unit/integration testing (e.g., “dummy mode” for tests).

CLI Independence: Ensure the step is runnable and testable as a CLI scriptlet as per your workspace standards.

Extensible: Only extend core features using well-commented, single-responsibility helper modules—do not break backward compatibility of function signature or behavior.

Traceable: Always log all events and changes to ctx for auditability.

By adopting these practices and expansions, ctx_event_bus_advanced.py will stay robust, auditable, scalable, and fully compliant with your orchestrator framework's goals of composability and traceability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_event_alert.py Documentation
1. Objective
The primary goal of ctx_event_alert.py is to provide a general, reusable mechanism for raising alerts and notifications when specific events occur in the workflow context (ctx). It enables steps and Dash dashboards to respond to important state changes, errors, or external events by executing custom notification logic, such as sending emails, posting to Slack, or updating the dashboard UI.

2. Description
ctx_event_alert.py acts as a bridge between the orchestrator’s event-driven state changes (captured in ctx["events"]) and notification or alerting logic.

It is designed as a core, atomic step that can be used in both recipe workflows and dashboards, ensuring modular and reusable orchestration logic.

Pattern:
Steps (Python or Shell) and even external systems append events as dicts to ctx["events"].
Each event dict usually (see ctx_event_bus.py for pattern) has keys like:

event (str): Event name/type (“job_failed”, “data_ready”, etc.)

timestamp: when the event was logged

source: which step/caller created the event

payload: any additional data relevant to the event

ctx_event_alert.py scans for events of a specific type and runs a provided function (notification hook) with event info as payload.

3. Dependencies
Core runtime: Python 3.6+

Context: Requires access to a ctx object (standard context interface).

Integration: No third-party or framework dependencies for the basic version; relies on other scriptlets for advanced integration (e.g., notification, Slack, email).

4. Application & Integration
As part of pipeline recipe steps: Insert as a Python step to trigger notification on failure/success or important milestones.

Within Dash apps: Can be invoked when new data, errors, or specific conditions are detected in ctx, triggering UI alerts, popups, etc.

Extension: The notification logic (notify_fn) is provided by parameter, so any arbitrary integration/notification can be achieved.

Integration with ctx_event_bus.py: Use in combination for full publish/subscribe event handling.

5. Limitations
Event Model: Only checks for and acts on existing events in ctx["events"]. It is not stateful or event-driven itself; it must be invoked by an orchestrator step, callback, or poller.

Notification Function: Requires a callable (notify_fn) to be passed in params; does not define the notification channel or mechanism.

No Persistence: Does not persist alert state; events are detected and acted upon per invocation.

Single Event Handling: Default usage triggers notification on the first matched event and exits unless customized.

No Event Removal: The event, once triggered, is not automatically removed/marked-as-read—could cause duplicate alerts unless managed externally.

Scalability: For very high-frequency events or asynchronous pipelines, may require batching, deduplication, or queueing logic external to this scriptlet.

6. Detailed Usage
Basic Signature
python
def run(ctx, params):
    """
    params = {
        "event": "job_failed",
        "notify_fn": my_notify_fn,
        "payload": {...}  # optional
    }
    """
ctx: The current shared orchestrator context (Context instance).

params: Dict with configuration.

Suppose ctx["events"] looks like below (appended by previous pipeline steps or event bus):

python
ctx["events"] = [
    {"event": "job_failed", "timestamp": "2025-08-26 10:30:00", "source": "train_model", "payload": {"job_id": 123, "error": "MemoryError"}},
    {"event": "data_ready",  "timestamp": "2025-08-26 10:31:00", "source": "data_loader"},
]
Example 1: Email Notification on Failure
python
def send_email(payload):
    print(f"Email sent to team: {payload}")

# As a pipeline step:
params = {
    "event": "job_failed",
    "notify_fn": send_email,         # this could call a scriptlet or external library
    # optional "payload" to override
}
result = run(ctx, params)
Result:

If an event == "job_failed" exists in ctx["events"], calls send_email(...) with the payload of that event.

Example 2: Slack/HTTP Notification
python
import requests

def post_to_slack(payload):
    # Use your workspace's advanced notification scriptlets or just a sample function
    requests.post('https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXX', json={"text": str(payload)})

params = {
    "event": "job_failed",
    "notify_fn": post_to_slack
}
run(ctx, params)
Example 3: With Custom Payload
You can override the payload, but normally, it uses the event’s payload.

python
def simple_alert(payload):
    print("ALERT:", payload)

params = {
    "event": "data_ready",
    "notify_fn": simple_alert,
    "payload": {"custom": "manual override"}  # Will be passed instead of the event["payload"]
}
run(ctx, params)
Example 4: In Dash App Callback (pseudo-code):
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_event_alert

def dash_alert_callback():
    ctx_event_alert.run(ctx, {
        "event": "data_ready",
        "notify_fn": lambda payload: show_dash_alert(payload)   # custom Dash function
    })
7. Example Pipeline Integration
Integrate as a step in a YAML recipe:

text
- idx: 7
  name: job_failure_alert
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_event_alert
  function: run
  params:
    event: "job_failed"
    notify_fn: !!python/name:my_package.send_slack_alert  # Use a proper import if required
Or chain after a batch of upstream steps:

text
- idx: 6
  name: check_and_notify
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_event_alert
  function: run
  params:
    event: "validation_error"
    notify_fn: !!python/name:scriptlets.python.core.ctx_notify.run
    payload:
      type: "slack"
      webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX"
      message: "Validation failed. Check logs."
8. Recommendations & Enhancement Suggestions
Here are specific, framework-compliant suggestions for expanding and improving ctx_event_alert.py:

a. Batch Processing & Deduplication
Add support for iterating through all matching events, not just first match.

Option to remove events after notification to prevent duplicate alerts (with an opt-in flag).

Optionally tag/mark events as “seen/notified” in ctx.

b. Event Filtering
Allow advanced filters: support payload pattern-matching, source filtering, or time-range constraints (e.g., “only new events since last run”).

c. Notification Registry & Expanded Channels
Integrate with a notification registry (extensible set of notification scriptlets, e.g., Slack, email, SMS, dashboard toast).

Provide sample notification functions for common destinations; document how to plug in arbitrary ones.

d. Async/Background Notification
Add non-blocking/asynchronous option for notifications, to avoid blocking orchestrator step if notification latency is high.

e. Event Template/Formatting
Allow message templating (e.g. Jinja2 or str.format) for customizing alert/notification content based on event attributes.

f. Enhanced Logging & Traceability
Log every alert sent, including time, payload, and destination, into ctx["alerts"] or ctx["audit"] for trace/audit.

Support test/dry-run mode (no-op, just logs) for recipe debugging.

g. CLI & Independent Operation
Make script independently runnable with CLI for manual event checks and notification triggers:

text
python ctx_event_alert.py --event job_failed --notify slack --payload_oneline '{"job_id":123}'
h. Unit Test Coverage
Include comprehensive pytest tests for scenarios:

No matching event.

Multiple matching events.

Error in notify_fn.

Removal/marking of events after notification.

i. Documentation and Discoverability
Auto-generate per-scriptlet documentation for available events/channels if feasible (align with your auto-discovery goals).

9. Best Practices
Always document event schemas (what keys exist in the event dict).

Use unique, descriptive event names to avoid confusion or missed alerts.

Keep notification hooks small, robust, and idempotent.

Centralize notification configuration (webhooks, emails) for maintainability.

Integrate with test and audit pipelines to validate notification pathways.

10. Summary Table
Aspect	Details
Objective	Trigger notification for specific events in ctx (pipeline/Dash)
Principle	Publish/subscribe, event-driven notification, scriptlet composability

Limitations	Stateless; acts only on existing events; per-call polling; must manage duplicates externally
Best Use	Error/success alerting, data-flow notifications, Dash UI updates
Extend With	Batch event scan/removal, async notifications, channel registry, message templating, full ctx audit log
Sample Step	See above YAML and call signatures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_error_handler.py — Centralized Error Handling for Orchestrated Pipelines
1. Objective
Provide a reusable, standardized context manager for centralized error handling in orchestrator pipelines and scriptlets.

Ensure that all exceptions within a workflow step are captured, logged (with traceback), and consistently attached to the shared ctx object under a standard errors key for later inspection, auditing, and troubleshooting.

Support robust recovery, rollback, and audit by enabling every pipeline step to consistently capture errors, including what failed, when, and with full detail.

Facilitate clear orchestration logic and compliance with the best practices outlined in your workspace for traceable, auditable, and easy-to-debug pipelines.

2. Description
What It Does
Deploys a contextlib.contextmanager-based wrapper to any step or scriptlet.

When the managed code block (a pipeline step) raises an exception:

The exception is caught.

The error details are structured and appended to ctx["errors"] as a dict.
This includes:

Step/context name

Timestamp

Exception message

Full traceback (enabling in-depth post-mortem/debug)

Exception can be optionally re-raised (default: yes), allowing either fail-fast or error-logging mode.

Where It Fits
In any pipeline step, scriptlet, or custom utility—Python steps should use this instead of ad-hoc try/except.

Complements the workspace’s requirements for:

Traceability

Step-level auditing

Exception transparency

Debuggability

High-Level API
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_error_handler import error_handler

with error_handler(ctx, "step_name"):
    # code block
    ...
3. Dependencies and Requirements
Python Standard Library Only:

time — for timestamps

traceback — for detailed stack trace on errors

contextlib — for context manager logic

No third-party packages required.
This keeps the scriptlet highly portable and easily included in any orchestrator-compatible project.

4. Applications and Integration
A. Within a Python Scriptlet
Any atomic "step" or scriptlet should be wrapped using ctx_error_handler.py:

python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_error_handler import error_handler

def run(ctx, params):
    with error_handler(ctx, "data_ingestion"):
        # demo: raise an error if the file can't be found
        with open(params["input_path"]) as f:
            ctx["raw_data"] = f.read()  # will raise FileNotFoundError if missing
        # More step logic...
B. With the Orchestrator Runner
Use in orchestrator main loops or wrapper steps:

python
for step in steps:
    with error_handler(ctx, step["name"], re_raise=True):   # re_raise = True for fail-fast
        execute_step(ctx, step)
C. Nested Errors (Advanced Usage)
If you have a deep workflow and want to track both leaf-step and higher-level errors:

python
with error_handler(ctx, "batch_processing"):
    for i in range(10):
        with error_handler(ctx, f"item_{i}", re_raise=False):
            process_item(i)
This logs all leaf errors but continues the batch.

D. Error-Triggered Rollback
Integrate with rollback utilities:

python
with error_handler(ctx, "transform", re_raise=True):
    result = do_transform(ctx)
    ctx["result"] = result

# after context:
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_rollback import run as rollback
rollback(ctx, {"snapshot": "Data/last_good.json", "errors_key": "errors"})
If an error was raised, this will restore ctx from snapshot.

5. Limitations
Only works within Python steps/scriptlets; cannot be used directly in shell steps.

Does not, itself, roll back state — just logs and (optionally) re-raises. Combine with other tools for recovery.

Does not log non-exception error conditions—only uncaught exceptions.

Records errors at the point of failure, not at orchestration level (i.e., user code must use the context manager!).

No custom error types or filtering; all exceptions are treated equally.

Error log grows indefinitely — upstream workflow should clear or save ctx["errors"] if needed.

Re-raise default = True:

If not handled externally, pipeline will fail/exit on error, unless you specify re_raise=False.

Does not handle process-level terminations or system signals.

6. Usage Examples (Detailed)
1. Basic Usage: Fail on Error, Log to ctx
python
from scriptlets.python.core.ctx_error_handler import error_handler

def run(ctx, params):
    with error_handler(ctx, "simple_math"):
        ctx["result"] = 1 / params["denominator"]  # raises ZeroDivisionError if zero
If denominator is zero, ctx["errors"] gets an entry like:

json
[{
  "step": "simple_math",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-26 06:00:34",
  "error": "division by zero",
  "traceback": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n ..."
}]
2. Continue on Error: Re-Raise Disabled
python
with error_handler(ctx, "optional_fetch", re_raise=False):
    ctx["remote_status"] = fetch_status(ctx["api_url"])
# pipeline continues even if fetch_status throws
3. Batch Error Collection
python
for source in sources:
    with error_handler(ctx, f"fetch_{source}", re_raise=False):
        ctx[source] = fetch_data(source)
# After batch, check ctx["errors"] to see which fetches failed
4. Step Timing + Error Handling (Composed with Other Context Managers)
python
from scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_step_timer import step_timer

with step_timer(ctx, "computation"):
    with error_handler(ctx, "computation"):
        result = run_heavy_job()
        ctx["result"] = result
You can safely nest this with other orchestration context managers.

5. Error Handling In a CLI Scriptlet
Your scriptlet is also a CLI. You can use this in if __name__ == '__main__':

python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    with error_handler(ctx, "cli_entry"):
        main_cli_logic()
7. Recommendation & Expansion (Compliance, Best Practices, and Future-Proofing)
A. Recommended Usage Patterns
Always wrap the critical logic of each step or scriptlet.

Use a unique, descriptive step_name.

Enable re_raise=True for critical failure steps, and re_raise=False for steps where batch continuation or recovery is acceptable.

Immediately serialize ctx["errors"] to disk or logs at the end of major pipelines.

B. Suggestions for Feature Expansion
Add Error Levels, Error Types, and Custom Messages

Allow specifying custom error level (e.g., "CRITICAL", "WARNING", "INFO") or error type in the log.

Example:

python
with error_handler(ctx, "step", level="WARNING"):
    ...
Structure log with "level": ..., "type": ....

Structured Error Codes and Classification

Let workflow/step authors add error codes/tags for fast triage.

Example:

python
with error_handler(ctx, "step_xyz", code=401):
    ...
Automatic Integration with Orchestrator Step Audit

Log error summaries to ctx["audit"] in coordinated format, for unified reporting.

Error Count Threshold / Abandon Workflow After N Errors

Parameter for max_errors — after N logged errors, raise or abort pipeline.

Support for Exception Filtering/Selective Catch

Only handle certain types (e.g., except (IOError, ValueError) as e:).

Better Multi-thread/Async/Multiprocess Compatibility

Ensure the error log is safe and consistent for concurrent updates, or recommend patterns for concurrent steps.

Alerts/Notify on Certain Error Types

Call notification scriptlet (e.g., send Slack/email) on serious errors (integration with ctx_notify.py).

Add CLI Utility to Pretty-print and Search ctx["errors"]

Scriptlet to filter or summarize all errors for audit/report.

Contextual Variable Dump on Error

Optionally snapshot current ctx or relevant variables alongside error info for easier debugging.

Error Escalation Hooks

Allow passing a callback/hook, so that when an error is caught, a custom function can execute (e.g., slack alert, rollback).

C. Tips for Maintaining Compliance
Document usage examples and signature in the module docstring for discoverability by the orchestrator CLI help system.

Maintain backward compatibility: extend, don't break, the signature.

Prefer adding optional parameters, never removing or altering the semantics of required ones.

All new logic should serialize cleanly for auditing (no non-serializable objects in errors list).

Keep test coverage: add or extend unit tests (as in your /tests directory) whenever feature is added.

8. Sample Enhanced Version Signature (Future)
python
@contextmanager
def error_handler(ctx, step_name, re_raise=True, level="ERROR", code=None, notify_fn=None, max_errors=None):
    ...
This allows full diagnostic, control, and framework integration.

Conclusion
ctx_error_handler.py is a central pillar of robust, debuggable, and production-grade automation in your orchestrator framework.
Applying the above recommendations will make it even more powerful, transparent, and in compliance with your project's standards for maintainable and auditable workflow code.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_distributed_job.py — Distributed Job Submission and Tracking
Objective
Provides a reusable scriptlet to submit a computational job to an external distributed job server (e.g., Celery, RESTful microservice), poll for status, and record detailed job information—status, id, result, and errors—within the orchestrator workspace's shared ctx. Enables robust orchestration of compute- or time-intensive tasks not suitable to run directly within the orchestrator process or on a single node.

Description
This module is designed to:

Submit a job to a remote server via HTTP POST.

Store job metadata (status, server job id, errors) in ctx["jobs"][job_id].

Poll the remote server periodically for status and results.

Update the shared ctx so orchestration logic and dashboards can monitor distributed jobs in real time.

It is meant for tasks such as:

Offloading model training or data processing to external compute resources (e.g., multi-node clusters, container services).

Interfacing with RESTful job APIs (for ML inference, analytics, batch ETL, etc.).

Allowing background work while the orchestrator continues running or executing other steps.

Dependencies
Standard Python 3.6+ (consistent with core orchestrator recommendations).

requests: For HTTP client functionality (already often a dependency in similar environments).

time: For polling intervals and timestamping.

Must be executed in an environment with access to the required remote server (network access, API keys, etc.).

Expects that ctx structure and job server API formats are known and consistent.

Application & Integration
Plug-and-play as a "python" step in any recipe YAML in the orchestrator framework, or used as a utility in other scriptlets.

All job tracking is centralized under ctx["jobs"] for easy dashboard display and querying.

Fully composable: may be called multiple times to manage multiple remote jobs serially or in parallel.

Designed for easy inclusion in recipes and as a building block for higher-level orchestration constructs (e.g., job queues, batch launches, error recovery flows).

Limitations
Synchronous polling (the main scriptlet loop blocks until completion or error, tying up the current orchestrator step unless run as a background step).

Hardcoded HTTP schema: Expects POST to submit, GET to poll, and JSON server responses with at least id and status fields; not directly compatible with non-REST APIs or SOAP/RPC workflows without adaptation.

Error handling is basic: propagates server errors or timeouts, but does not handle network partitions, exponential backoff, or retries.

Not highly customizable for arbitrary job workflows (e.g., no callback URLs, no flexible polling interval, no multiple result fields).

Assumes remote job is short enough that polling is a feasible pattern.

No authentication support built in (for OAuth/Bearer tokens, etc.—must be extended as needed).

Does not auto-clean finished jobs from ctx (cleanup is manual/optional).

No timeouts or abort handling for stuck jobs—user is responsible for kill/timeout flows.

Usage
Basic REST Job Submission
Python scriptlet usage:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_distributed_job

# Application example, using run(ctx, params) contract
ctx = {}
params = {
    "job_id": "myjob1",
    "server_url": "http://localhost:5000/jobs",
    "payload": {
        "task": "process_data",
        "args": {"input_file": "data.csv", "output_file": "result.csv"}
    }
}
ctx_distributed_job.run(ctx, params)
# ctx["jobs"]["myjob1"] now contains status, server_id, etc.
Recipe YAML integration:

text
- idx: 10
  name: submit_my_job
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_distributed_job
  function: run
  params:
    job_id: myjob1
    server_url: http://localhost:5000/jobs
    payload:
      task: process_data
      args:
        input_file: data.csv
        output_file: result.csv
Behavior on Successful Job:
On submission, expects the server to return JSON with at least id field.

It then polls via GET on server_url/{id} until job status is either "done" or "error".

On completion, stores server and status info under ctx["jobs"][job_id]:

python
ctx["jobs"][job_id] = {
    "status": "done",
    "server_id": "<server-id>",
    "result": {...}  # whatever the server provides
}
If the job fails:

python
ctx["jobs"][job_id] = {
    "status": "error",
    "error": "<message>",
    "result": None
}
Batch/Parallel Job Submission
To run jobs in parallel, submit multiple jobs as orchestrator recipe steps with distinct job_id.

For true concurrency, wrap each in a background step or implement a queue with ctx references.

Dealing with Custom Server Schemas
If the remote API requires authentication headers, non-JSON serialization, or different response fields,
you must extend the scriptlet (see recommendations below).

For non-REST APIs, this scriptlet must be adapted or wrapped accordingly.

Detailed Examples
Minimal Example
python
ctx = {}
params = {
    "job_id": "job42",
    "server_url": "http://api.taask.io/submit",
    "payload": {
        "script": "run_sim",
        "params": {"case": 7}
    }
}
out = ctx_distributed_job.run(ctx, params)
print(ctx['jobs']['job42'])
# Output includes: status, server_id, error/result if available.
Polling for Results Later
If the orchestrator crashes or is restarted, since all state is in ctx, simply inspect or resume polling via a new step with the stored server_id.

Advanced: Integration with Notification
Combine in a flow:

text
- idx: 10
  name: launch_analysis_job
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_distributed_job
  function: run
  params:
    job_id: analysis1
    server_url: http://jobs/api/v1/jobs
    payload: {...}
- idx: 11
  name: notify_if_failure
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_notify
  function: run
  params:
    type: slack
    webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX
    message: |
      'Job analysis1 failed: {ctx[jobs][analysis1][error]}'
  depends_on: [launch_analysis_job]
  # (add a conditional step runner in orchestrator to check ctx, or wrap in a Python scriptlet)
Background Job Submission
To avoid blocking the orchestrator, designate the submission step as background: true in your recipe's step definition:

text
- idx: 20
  name: submit_job_background
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_distributed_job
  function: run
  background: true
  params: {...}
Then monitor/wait for completion via polling steps later in the flow.

Recommendation & Tips for Expansion / Enhancement
To better align with your orchestrator framework's philosophy—reusability, composability, safety, and full auditability—consider the following:

General Enhancements
Non-blocking Option / Async Mode:
Allow jobs to be optionally submitted in "fire-and-forget" mode (just start/persist meta, let user call a separate poll function).

Provide a new action such as {"action": "poll", "job_id": ...} to only check status.

Consider splitting into submit and poll steps, to enable robust batch handling and avoid runner locks.

Configurable Poll Interval & Timeout:
Allow users to specify polling interval (default: 2s) and total timeouts, as heavy jobs may run for a long time.

Authentication Support:
Allow passing extra headers (headers param) for API keys, tokens, or other HTTP auth schemes.

Flexible Result Handling:
Optionally parse/upload/download remote files as results, or allow user to provide a callback for custom result extraction.

Improved Error Handling and Re-try Logic:

Add exponential backoff, max retry count, network error handling.

Automatic Cleanup or Expiry:
Provide options to remove old jobs from ctx, or retain a rolling buffer for memory safety.

Batch/Array Job Support:
Extend to auto-submit/poll multiple jobs with list inputs, aggregate their results under e.g. ctx["jobs_batch"].

Event Notification Hook:
Add optional integration with notification scriptlets to trigger alerts on completion or failure.

Compliant Docstring and Examples:
Add docstring in file header per workspace standard, showing usage, requirements, and CLI-access patterns.

Code/Design Example for Some Enhancements
python
"""
ctx_distributed_job.py
----------------------
(see workspace documentation for framework integration)

- Supports job submission and polling with a single function/param.
- Accepts 'mode': 'submit', 'poll', or 'submit_and_poll'.
- Accepts 'headers' for HTTP auth.
- Accepts 'poll_interval' and 'timeout' params.
- Can output logs to ctx['jobs_log'] and trigger notification via ctx_notify if desired.
...
"""
Add these params in run, and switch on 'mode', allowing for greater flow flexibility.

Security Tip
Always validate all external input (job_server URLs, payloads).

Do not store or log sensitive material in ctx (unless encrypted or protected).

Summary Table
Field	Description
job_id	Unique ctx key for job tracking
server_url	Endpoint for the remote job API
payload	JSON-serializable dict with job description
poll_interval	Optional, seconds between status checks (default 2)
timeout	Optional, max seconds to poll (fail if not done/error in this time)
headers	Optional, dict of HTTP headers for API authentication
mode	Optional, one of submit, poll, submit_and_poll
result_key	Optional, ctx key to copy result to, for dashboard/reuse

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_diff.py — Documentation
Objective
The primary objective of ctx_diff.py is to provide a straightforward mechanism to compare two snapshots (dictionaries) of the shared context (ctx) in the orchestrator framework and highlight the differences between them. It reports which top-level keys were added, removed, or changed. This aids debugging, auditing, regression analysis, and step-by-step traceability.

Description
ctx_diff.py implements a function suitable for use as a scriptlet or as a callable inside Python workflows. It operates only on the top-level keys of dictionary-like objects (recommended: those of the orchestrator's Context class).

Functionality: Given the current ctx and a reference (older) ctx snapshot, the scriptlet:

Lists all keys that have been added (exist in current, missing in old)

Lists all keys that have been removed (exist in old, missing in current)

Lists all keys whose values have changed (exist in both, but value differs; comparison is shallow/equality-based)

Returns: A dictionary with lists under added, removed, and changed keys.

Dependencies
Standard library:

None beyond Python's built-in language features (uses only Python basics like lists, dictionaries, and native equality comparison).

Framework:

Designed to be used with the orchestrator's Context class (subclass of dict), but will work with any dictionary.

Python Version:

3.6+ recommended (minimum needed for f-strings and dictionary comprehensions).

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
Applications
Debugging: Quickly spot changes between consecutive pipeline steps or after restoring from failure.

Auditing: Provide repeatable, human/auditor-friendly change sets.

Regression Testing: Confirm output and side-effects of steps remain consistent by comparing two ctx snapshots.

Pipeline Resumptions: Detect what data or state has diverged after resuming from checkpoint.

Dashboards: Dynamically show changes in pipeline state.

Integration
Pipeline Scriptlet: Used as a step in YAML recipes by referencing as a python step.

Ad hoc Audit: Called programmatically (in Python) between pipeline steps or as part of test code.

Combined with Snapshot Tools: Use in tandem with snapshot utilities (e.g., ctx_snapshot.py) to write out or load checkpoints.

Example Usage
1. As a stand-alone scriptlet in a recipe:

text
- name: compare_ctx_before_after
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_diff
  function: run
  params:
    old: !!python/object:context.Context {...saved data...}
(Replace {...saved data...} with a deserialized ctx snapshot if calling in YAML. Usually, you would load a previous snapshot and pass it in.)

2. Programmatically as a function:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_diff

ctx_now = {'foo': 123, 'bar': [1,2], 'baz': 7}
ctx_prev = {'foo': 900, 'bar': [1,2], 'new': 8}

diff = ctx_diff.run(ctx_now, {'old': ctx_prev})
print(diff)
# Expected output:
# {
#   'added': ['baz'],
#   'removed': ['new'],
#   'changed': ['foo']
# }
3. With pipeline snapshot utilities:

python
# Take a snapshot at step N
import copy
snapshot = copy.deepcopy(ctx)
# After further processing...
changes = ctx_diff.run(ctx, {'old': snapshot})
print("What changed since last snapshot?", changes)
4. In dashboard callback or reporting:

python
recent_changes = ctx_diff.run(ctx, {"old": last_ctx})
# Use 'recent_changes' to highlight updates in your Dash app.
More Detailed Example
Suppose:

python
old_ctx = {
    "result": [1, 2, 3],
    "status": "ok",
    "metrics": {"score": 9}
}
new_ctx = {
    "result": [1, 2, 3],
    "metrics": {"score": 10},
    "summary": "complete"
}
diff_report = ctx_diff.run(new_ctx, {"old": old_ctx})
print(diff_report)
# Output:
# {
#   'added': ['summary'],
#   'removed': ['status'],
#   'changed': ['metrics']
# }
'summary' was added.

'status' was removed.

'metrics' was changed (different dictionary content).

Limitations
Top-level Only: Compares only top-level keys. If nested objects (e.g. dictionaries/lists) have internal differences but their outer value is equal, the difference will not be detected as "changed".

Shallow/Equality Comparison: Uses != for value comparison—deep differences are only noticed if the top-level item is not equal (e.g. a list's elements differ, or a dict has any difference). Does not provide a recursive diff or unified "patch view" for nested objects.

No Human-Readable Diff of Values: Does not produce a diff (unified or side-by-side) of the actual values, only lists the keys. Does not show what actually changed inside the key.

No Metadata: No time, author, or metadata on difference (but this could be enriched from Context if expanded).

No Serialization: Expects both dicts/contexts to be present in memory; does not load from or write to disk.

Recommendations for Expansion & Enhancement
1. Nested (Recursive) Diff Support
Expand the comparison so that for changed keys, you can return what inside the value has changed, not just the fact that it did.

Implement unified diff for nested dicts/lists, similar to Python’s difflib or tools like deepdiff.

2. Value Diff Output
For each changed key, add a "diff" entry showing the before/after values, and optionally a string diff (for text).

Example:

python
{'changed': [{'key': 'foo', 'old': 2, 'new': 5}]}
3. Pattern Matching and Filtering
Allow an optional param such as filter_keys (list of key patterns or regular expressions) to restrict which keys are inspected.

4. Change Type Reporting
Report for each key whether it was added, removed, or modified, and optionally the type of change (e.g., 'added', 'removed', 'value', 'type').

5. Integration with Audit Trail
Leverage Context's internal _history (if available) to trace not just differences, but who and when changes occurred.

6. Dash/CLI-Friendly Export
Optionally output the diff as a Markdown or HTML table for dashboards or reports, or even write a summary file.

7. Command Line Interface
Make the file executable as a stand-alone script:

Allow loading two JSON ctx files and produce a diff report to stdout or a file.

Example:

text
python ctx_diff.py old_ctx.json new_ctx.json --out diffs.md
8. Backward/Forward Compatibility
Provide options to ignore certain fields (for backward-compatible changes), or to allow fuzzy comparison (e.g., for float rounding).

9. Plugin Hook for Custom Differs
Expose an API for custom value comparison logic per key (e.g., to ignore small float differences).

Tips & Best Practices
Use After Major Steps: Insert this check after workflow milestones to catch unexpected ctx changes.

Store Diffs for Audit: When running pipelines, store diff reports as part of your logs or artifacts for retracing/rollback.

Combine with Rollback/Snapshotting: Use diffs to validate the effect of a rollback/restore operation.

Visualize Diffs: Plug the output into a Dash DataTable or other UI to aid human interpretation, especially if you're monitoring live pipeline states.

Test with Rich Data: Validate its outputs with both flat and nested context dictionaries to understand its behavior and plan enhancements.

Think About Performance: For very large ctx data, implement pagination or lazy diffing (or filter keys for diffing).

Summary Table
Section	Description
Objective	Compare two ctx objects and list which top-level keys were added, removed, or changed.
Dependencies	Python 3.6+, no non-standard libraries.
Application	Debugging, auditing, regression testing, pipeline resume catch-up, dashboarding.
Usage	Python API: run(ctx, {"old": old_ctx}); as a step in a recipe; integrated with snapshots.
Limitations	Shallow (not recursive), no value diffs, no time/author metadata, in-memory only.
Enhancement	Support nested/recursive diffs, value diff reporting, filtering, CLI, audit trail, UI export.
This scriptlet is a foundational utility for data change discovery between orchestrator steps. Augmenting it with nesting, UI output, and richer metadata would be highly beneficial for a robust, auditable, and transparent workflow framework.

ctx_debug_dump.py — Comprehensive Documentation
Objective
To provide a quick, consistent, and scriptable mechanism to dump the entire orchestrator shared in-memory context (ctx) to a human-readable, versioned JSON file for offline inspection, troubleshooting, auditing, and reproducibility. This tool ensures traceability and debuggability of all intermediate pipeline and workflow states.

Description
ctx_debug_dump.py is a utility scriptlet that exports the current contents of ctx into a JSON file, suitable for review after workflow steps, upon errors, or for compliance/auditing.

The exported file adopts pretty-printed formatting (indentation, sorted keys) for easy manual inspection.

The dump can be integrated within workflows, appended after important steps, error handlers, or background jobs for deep analysis.

This scriptlet does not alter ctx or affect any data in upstream or downstream steps: it is purely a side-effect for observability.

Requirements and Dependencies
Python Version: 3.6+

Standard Libraries:

json (for serialization)

No third-party packages required.

Applications & Integrations
Where and why to use:
Debugging: Pinpoint errors/failures by examining the precise state of ctx at any step.

Auditing/Traceability: Maintain an externally reviewable record of pipeline state for quality, compliance, and certification.

CI/CD Pipelines: Attach dumps as build/test artifacts when running recipes/tests non-interactively.

Live Support: Quickly show context to a remote support/engineering team in case of anomalies.

Step Output Review: Save states after critical transformations or before/after “dangerous” merges or cleans.

Integration Points:
End of major steps: Use as the last step in a recipe, before/after data transformation, after background jobs, before error-raising.

Error Handling: Call after any step raising an Exception.

Unit/Integration Testing: Use in test scripts for snapshot comparison or regression tracking.

Manual or Scheduled Debugging: As a scheduled/background job (using ctx_scheduler.py) to periodically snapshot state.

Limitations
Only JSON-serializable ctx keys will be dumped (compliant with Context design best practices).

Sensitive information in ctx will be dumped as well: beware of secrets/API keys unless ctx is scrubbed prior.

Does not restore or load ctx: This is a one-way export; for restoration, see ctx_restore.py.

Performance on very large ctx objects may degrade, especially if ctx contains large arrays or deeply nested objects.

Not atomic: In highly concurrent situations, a “half-written” dump could appear if the script is interrupted part way.

No built-in file rotation or pruning: Old dumps need to be managed/deleted manually or by a clean-up tool.

Detailed Usage
Python API
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_debug_dump
ctx = {"foo": [1, 2, 3], "bar": {"x": 1}}
ctx_debug_dump.run(ctx, {"out": "Logs/ctx_dump.json"})
# => "Logs/ctx_dump.json" now contains a pretty-printed JSON of ctx
Shell/CLI (if enabled as a main entry):
text
python scriptlets/python/core/ctx_debug_dump.py --out Logs/latest_ctx.json
Note: Actual script may require you to add a CLI parser if it does not exist.

Example: End-of-step in a Recipe
text
- name: dump_ctx_after_data_clean
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_debug_dump
  function: run
  params:
    out: Logs/data_clean_ctx.json
Example: Automated Periodic Dumps Using Scheduler
text
- name: start_periodic_ctx_dump
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_scheduler
  function: run
  params:
    jobs:
      - job_id: periodic_ctx_snapshot
        fn: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_debug_dump.run
        args:
          out: Logs/periodic_ctx_{timestamp}.json
        interval: 600  # every 10 minutes
You would need to write a timestamp-generating wrapper for true timestamped dumps.

Example: As Part of Error Handling
python
try:
    # critical step
    run_my_step(ctx, ...)
except Exception as e:
    from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_debug_dump
    ctx_debug_dump.run(ctx, {"out": "Logs/error_ctx.json"})
    raise
Recommendations for Expansion and Enhancement
In keeping with the modular, auditable, and devops-friendly design ethos of your framework:

1. Timestamped Output & Automatic Naming
Support smart output filenames—e.g., "Logs/ctx_dump_{datetime}.json"—if out is omitted or set to "auto".

Allow placeholder substitution (e.g., {step}, {runid}) in output filenames for traceability in pipelines.

2. Configurable Key Filtering/Redaction
Add keys or exclude_keys params to only dump/select a specific subset of ctx keys (e.g., omit "secrets" or "temp_data").

Support a simple masking mechanism (mask passwords, API keys).

3. Compression Option
Support writing as gzip (ctx_dump.json.gz) for very large dumps.

4. Hooks for Step Metadata
Support embedding step metadata (current step name, timestamp, possibly CLI args) in the dump for context.

5. Comparison Utility
Add an optional “compare” mode, leveraging diffs to compare the current ctx dump with a previous one, highlighting changes.

Cross-link with ctx_diff.py and ctx_diff_report.py tools for historical or regression analysis.

6. Support for Asynchronous/Periodic Snapshots
Integrate with ctx_scheduler.py to enable automatic periodic snapshots, as in automated monitoring workflows.

7. CLI Integration
Add an optional command-line parser to directly run from CLI for ad-hoc debugging outside the orchestrator runner.

8. Atomic/Thread-safe Dumping
Use file locks or atomic-write utilities to avoid overwrite issues in high-concurrency situations.

9. Metadata-Enhanced Output
Allow inclusion of orchestrator state info, run ID, step name, and resource usage statistics in the JSON payload.

10. Pruning/Rotation
Recommend a helper tool for pruning dumps older than X days (can be a shell script or another Python tool for workspace hygiene).

Tips for Effective Use
Always use after error-prone or major mutation steps for best traceability.

Rotate or archive old dumps to save disk space if running in long-term/automated settings.

Automate dumps at regular pipeline intervals for pipeline forensics, especially when using background/threaded jobs.

If storing in Logs/, regularly clean up using tools/clean_pristine.sh or custom scripts.

Whenever possible, document the reason for a manual dump in the filename or in a metadata section inside the JSON.

Summary:
ctx_debug_dump.py is a foundational scriptlet for debugging, reproducibility, and auditability of your orchestrator pipeline. By expanding it per the above recommendations—timestamped, filterable, CLI-friendly, and more—it can further serve as a robust backbone for compliant, scalable, and observable workflow management.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_checkpoint.py — Detailed Scriptlet Documentation
Objective
ctx_checkpoint.py is designed to provide safe, versioned in-memory checkpoints for the shared orchestrator context (ctx) used in your automation pipelines. It allows the workflow to save and restore the complete ctx at named points, enabling rapid recovery, rollbacks, and reproducibility of any test or automation state.

Description
Checkpointing lets you freeze the exact state of all ctx data at key pipeline moments ("checkpointing") and revert to any checkpoint later ("restoring").

This scriptlet works entirely in RAM by deep-copying ctx, so it is fast and does not involve disk I/O (unless you persist _checkpoints externally).

Checkpoints are stored under the ctx key: ctx["_checkpoints"][name] = snapshot, where snapshot is a deep copy of the full ctx at that moment.

Supports two main operations via param "action":

"save": Save the current ctx under a checkpoint name.

"restore": Replace the current ctx with a named checkpoint.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+

Standard library: copy for deep copy operations.

No third-party dependencies.

Application and Integration
Typical Use Cases:

Save starting or intermediary context before long-running or risky steps.

Implement safe rollback in multi-step tests or ETL pipelines.

Support "resume from checkpoint" workflows, debugging, or development.

Integrate with error handlers to recover ctx after error/fault conditions.

For audit/compliance, checkpoints help reproduce tests from any historic state.

How To Integrate in Your Recipe YAML:

text
- name: save_checkpoint_midway
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_checkpoint
  function: run
  params:
    action: save
    name: midway
  # Save a checkpoint called 'midway'—ctx["_checkpoints"]["midway"]
Restore in a later step:

text
- name: rollback_to_midway
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_checkpoint
  function: run
  params:
    action: restore
    name: midway
  # Overwrites ctx with 'midway' checkpoint (if it exists)
Usage Examples
1. Save a named checkpoint (in a recipe step):

text
- name: save_checkpoint1
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_checkpoint
  function: run
  params:
    action: save
    name: before_stage2
Result:

Deep copy of ctx saved in ctx["_checkpoints"]["before_stage2"]

2. Restore a checkpoint (revert ctx):

text
- name: restore_before_stage2
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_checkpoint
  function: run
  params:
    action: restore
    name: before_stage2
If before_stage2 exists, the full ctx is replaced by that version.
Returns: {"checkpoint_restored": "before_stage2"}

3. CLI and Python integration:

python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_checkpoint
ctx = {'foo': 123, 'bar': [1,2,3]}
params = {"action": "save", "name": "init"}
ctx_checkpoint.run(ctx, params)   # Saves checkpoint
# Modify ctx...
ctx['foo'] = 888
ctx_checkpoint.run(ctx, {"action": "restore", "name": "init"})
assert ctx['foo'] == 123
4. Inspect available checkpoints:

python
# All checkpoint names:
list(ctx.get("_checkpoints", {}))   # e.g., ['init', 'before_stage2', ...]
5. Error Handling Example:
Place a save checkpoint step before risky/experimental computation.
On error, insert a restore step (or automate with orchestrator’s error traps).

Limitations
Volatile: Checkpoints exist only in RAM unless explicitly serialized (e.g., use ctx_snapshot or ctx_to_file to persist _checkpoints).

Size: Deep-copy of full ctx—large contexts increase memory usage per checkpoint.

Overwrite: Saving a checkpoint with an existing name replaces it.

No partial merge: Only supports full ctx snapshot/restore, not partial/multi-key merge.

Manual prune: Script does not expire or prune old checkpoints automatically.

No file-based native support: Use ctx_snapshot.py or custom code to write/read checkpoints to files for disk-based recovery.

Recommendations & Future Enhancement Suggestions
Here’s how to expand or enhance ctx_checkpoint.py to better fit the advanced, robust orchestrator style your documentation promotes:

1. File Persistence Integration
Enhance: Add optional (param) ability to write named checkpoint to a file (action: "save_file") and restore from file.

Benefit: Survives orchestrator crashes, enables archiving, or sharing context between runs/sessions.

Sample enhancement:

python
import json
if action == "save_file":
    with open(f"Data/checkpoint_{name}.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(ctx, f)
if action == "restore_file":
    with open(f"Data/checkpoint_{name}.json") as f:
        snap = json.load(f)
    ctx.clear()
    ctx.update(snap)
2. Timestamp/versioning
Enhance: When saving, store timestamp and optionally a user message/comment per checkpoint.

Benefit: Supports audit trace, UI listing, and debugging.

Sample:

python
ctx["_checkpoints"][name] = {
    "snapshot": copy.deepcopy(dict(ctx)),
    "timestamp": time.time(),
    "comment": params.get("comment", "")
}
3. Prune Policy
Enhance: Add parameters or a scheduled process to auto-expire old checkpoints (by count or age).

Benefit: Prevent runaway RAM use in long automation runs.

4. Partial/Selective Checkpoint
Enhance: Option to checkpoint/restore only selected ctx keys (e.g., params: {keys: ['foo', 'bar']})

Benefit: More efficient for large ctx; enables partial rollback without touching all context.

5. Integration with Error Handler/Logger
Enhance: Automatic checkpoint on every orchestrator error, optionally log the checkpoint id with the error.

Benefit: Makes post-mortem analysis/rollbacks seamless.

6. Command Line Utility
Enhance: Standalone CLI interface for listing, saving, and restoring checkpoints for debugging or offline manipulation.

7. Status & Audit Reporting
Enhance: Add a function to list all current checkpoints with labels, times, and comments, optionally writing an audit/log file.

Tips for Usage and Compliance
Always document why a checkpoint is saved ("before risky job", "ready for reporting" etc.) to ensure traceability.

Restore with caution: Restoring a checkpoint forcibly replaces ctx and all current state.

Combine with ctx_snapshot.py for persistent on-disk recovery.

Leverage in test/debug/dev: Use frequent checkpoints to quickly revert bad states when developing new workflows or scriptlets.

Avoid saving excessively: Deep copies can stress memory if overused.

Example — Full Save/Restore Workflow in a Recipe
text
steps:
  - idx: 10
    name: checkpoint_start
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_checkpoint
    function: run
    params: {action: save, name: step10_start}

  - idx: 11
    name: do_work
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.steps.expensive_step
    function: run
    params: {input_key: "foo", out_key: "bar"}
    depends_on: [checkpoint_start]

  - idx: 12
    name: maybe_rollback
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_checkpoint
    function: run
    params: {action: restore, name: step10_start}
    # Only if a problem occurs in step 11
In summary:
ctx_checkpoint.py is a core building block for safe, reproducible, and resilient orchestrator pipelines, enabling precise mid-execution "save point" and "rewind" for the shared context. Expanding its auditability, flexibility, and security (persistence, partial/filtered, auto-prune, better metadata) would further strengthen the framework’s robustness and scaling.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_cache.py — Documentation
Objective
Provide a lightweight, convenient mechanism for caching expensive computations or aggregated views in the shared in-memory context (ctx) of the orchestrator pipeline. The main goals are to:

Avoid recomputing results for repeated operations (“don’t repeat yourself” principle).

Accelerate steps driven by Dash, reporting, or AI analysis by caching intermediate results.

Simplify code where pipelines or Dash callbacks need reusable, memoized results across steps or chart widgets.

Description
ctx_cache.py defines a single run(ctx, params) function. When invoked from a step, it examines ctx for the presence of the target cache key:

If the cache (key) exists:
The value is returned without computation.

If the cache doesn't exist:
The code invokes the user-supplied function (compute_fn) with arguments (args), stores the result in ctx[key], and returns it.

This is an essential building-block for performance and DRYness in pipelines or dashboards that frequently repeat data transformation or aggregation.

Requirements / Dependencies
Python version: 3.6+ (consistent with workspace policy).

No external dependencies.

No side effects: Cache “sits” only in provided in-memory ctx, making it safe for process/thread cloning.

Expects compute_fn to be a Python callable and args to be a dict of arguments.

Applications, Integrations, Usage
Recommended Use Cases
Dash Callbacks:
Precompute or memoize heavy data transformations or filtering for visuals.
Example: “Show latest filtered metrics dashboard—compute once and reuse for multiple graphs.”

Pipeline Steps:
Expensive file loading, statistics, or AI calculations—store as ctx key and skip on rerun.

Multi-step Recipes:
When a value is computed in one step and used many times downstream (e.g., normalized data, model inference results).

Integration in a Recipe YAML
text
- name: cache_metrics
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_cache
  function: run
  params:
    key: "filtered_metrics"
    compute_fn: !python/name:my_mod.compute_filtered_metrics
    args:
      raw_data_key: "raw_metrics"
      threshold: 80
Note: compute_fn must be accessible in orchestrator context (import/path consideration—see enhancement suggestions below).

Direct Step/Scriptlet Example
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_cache

# Example expensive computation function
def compute_sum(a, b):
    print("Actually computing..")
    return a + b

ctx = {}

# First call: Not cached
result = ctx_cache.run(ctx, {"key": "sum42", "compute_fn": compute_sum, "args": {"a": 40, "b": 2}})
print(result)  # -> {'cached': False, 'value': 42}

# Second call: Uses cache
result = ctx_cache.run(ctx, {"key": "sum42", "compute_fn": compute_sum, "args": {"a": 40, "b": 2}})
print(result)  # -> {'cached': True, 'value': 42}
Within a Dash callback:
python
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_cache as ctx_cache

def expensive_df_filter(df, query):
    # ... computations ...
    return filtered_df

def run_dash_callback(ctx):
    filter_query = "foo > 10"
    cache_key = f"dash_filter_{hash(filter_query)}"
    result = ctx_cache.run(ctx, {
        "key": cache_key,
        "compute_fn": expensive_df_filter,
        "args": {"df": ctx["full_df"], "query": filter_query}
    })
    filtered_df = result["value"]
    # ... use filtered_df ...
Limitations
Callable Reference:
compute_fn must be a direct Python callable (not serializable via YAML!)—this restricts YAML/CLI-based recipe authoring somewhat, as Python callables aren’t natively encoded in YAML or CLI params.

In-memory Only:
Cached values are lost if ctx is not persisted or if the orchestrator is restarted.

No Expiration/Eviction:
Once set, a cached value persists until explicitly deleted or ctx is cleared.

No Recompute Trigger:
There is no automatic cache invalidation on changes to arguments, underlying data, or time. The cache key must explicitly account for data version, parameters, or other cache-busting criteria.

No support for async/process-based result computation (unless compute_fn handles its own concurrency).

No audit/history of cache misses/hits beyond the returned dict.

Examples: Practical Patterns
Simple numeric cache

python
def expensive_count_rows(data):
    return len(data)

ctx = {"my_data": [1,2,3,4]}
# Computation and cache
ctx_cache.run(ctx, {
    "key": "row_count",
    "compute_fn": expensive_count_rows,
    "args": {"data": ctx["my_data"]}
})
# Later: fast hit
ctx_cache.run(ctx, {
    "key": "row_count",
    "compute_fn": expensive_count_rows,
    "args": {"data": ctx["my_data"]}
})
Cache with parameterized results

python
def filter_above(lst, threshold):
    return [x for x in lst if x > threshold]

for threshold in [5, 10, 20]:
    key = f"filtered_{threshold}"
    ctx_cache.run(ctx, {
        "key": key,
        "compute_fn": filter_above,
        "args": {"lst": ctx["values"], "threshold": threshold}
    })
Recommendations for Enhancement
1. YAML/Recipe-Friendly Function References

Allow functions to be referenced by dotted string path (e.g. "my.module.fun") and resolve with importlib or similar logic within run. That way, recipes could declaratively specify a compute function by name.

2. Cache Expiry/Eviction

Support optional parameters such as TTL (expire_sec) or size limits. On cache miss, if the value has expired or cache exceeds limit, recompute and store a fresh value.

Possibly maintain ctx["_cache_metadata"] with times and hits per key.

3. Argument-Sensitive Cache Keys

Automate cache key generation based on function args (e.g., key = f"cache_{func.__name__}_{hash(frozenset(args.items()))}" ) for less manual error.

Or, accept an extra salt/version/hash parameter to assist with cache busting.

4. Persistent Cache

Optionally write cache contents (or select keys) to disk (e.g., as JSON or pickle), and reload across pipeline restarts.

5. Cache Hit/Miss Tracing and Logging

Add logging to ctx["log"] and record hit/miss statistics for dashboard reporting or performance analysis.

6. Async/Process-based Computation

Allow compute_fn to be dispatched using built-in threading or multiprocessing for scalable cache fills (especially for Dash).

7. Multi-value and Bulk Caching

Support batch cache insertions or "map" style caching for sets of arguments.

8. Smart Invalidation Hooks

Permit explicit cache invalidation via signal (e.g. on downstream data change) or via API.

9. Unit Tests and Recipe Examples

Provide a complete suite of tests under tests/ demonstrating all patterns above.

Add example to demo recipes for using caching with realistic computation steps.

Best Practices and Tips
Always document what is being cached and why. Use descriptive cache keys that encode relevant parameters or data versions.

Use for expensive, deterministic pure functions only. Don’t cache nondeterministic or stateful results unless necessary.

Manually invalidate cache if underlying data changes.

Avoid unbounded growth: Periodically clear or rotate ctx for long-running pipelines.

Combine with logging: Trace cache hits/misses to debug performance and behavior.

Conclusion
ctx_cache.py is a key ingredient for high-performance, DRY, and scalable orchestration in both pipelines and dashboards, but it should be expanded (with the suggestions above) to fully empower declarative recipe authoring, production ops, and monitoring as your orchestrator framework grows.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_bg_trace.py — Documentation
Objective
To provide a reusable, composable scriptlet for tracing, logging, and managing background (and parallel) process execution in orchestrator workflows. It automates the monitoring of start time, end time, duration, and success/error status of asynchronous or concurrent tasks, logging these events in the shared ctx. This is invaluable for debugging, dashboarding, automated audit, and diagnosing performance bottlenecks in automated pipelines.

Description
This scriptlet launches a background (threading.Thread) task that runs a provided function (fn) with optional parameters.

It tracks and logs:

Task start time

Task end time

Total duration

Success/failure status

Exception/error message (if any)

All trace logs are appended to a list under a specified key in the global shared context (ctx), defaulting to ctx["bg_trace"].

If you’re orchestrating several background jobs (e.g., parallel data loading, concurrent computations within Dash dashboard, remote async requests), ctx_bg_trace.py provides full lifecycle visibility of each run.

Trace/logs in ctx can be consumed by dashboards, audits, or reporting tools.

Does not block the main orchestrator pipeline — steps proceed without waiting for background jobs, but you can join threads later if desired.

Dependencies
Python >= 3.6

Standard library:

threading

time

Integration compatibility:

Expects orchestrator workflow and step convention (receives ctx, params)

No external dependencies required

Applications & Integrations
Live Data Preparation: Run background data generation, polling, or streaming for dashboards/Dash apps while pipeline continues.

Async ETL Steps: Start time-consuming fetch, preprocess, or notify actions in the background (e.g., upload large files while pipeline continues).

Concurrent Step Diagnostics: Add resource, duration, and error traceability for heavy or flaky tasks to help with robust retries or alerting.

Pipeline Observability: Incorporate step-level trace data into dashboards or audit reports for historical tracking and performance review.

Unit/Integration Test Harness: Simulate, trace, and record background operation lifecycle in test or debug environments.

Batch Parallelism: Use multiple invocations to track stages in batch jobs (e.g., forking parallel tasks in a loop, each with separate keys).

Limitations
Only supports background threading via Python’s threading.Thread (not multiprocessing or true OS-level process pools).

No built-in result retrieval or join: It traces status, but you must check or join threads externally if you require synchronous retrieval.

Not suited for heavy CPU-bound tasks (Python’s GIL limits concurrency). For such, use multiprocessing or process pool approaches.

Not automatically recoverable: If the main process dies or is interrupted, background thread results are lost.

No built-in resource (CPU/mem) monitoring — only tracks times and error.

Trace scope is per-process: Tracing is not distributed; no cross-host job status is provided.

ctx_bg_trace.run(ctx, {"key": "fetched", "fn": simulate_data_fetch, "args": {"delay": 2}})
# In your Dash callback, reference ctx["fetched"] when available.
Recommendation & Enhancement Suggestions
1. Result/Exception Propagation and Callback
Allow the user to provide a callback or continuation function that is called with the result or exception after the background work finishes.
Add "on_complete"/"on_error" parameter.

2. Thread/Object Handle Registration
Store and optionally return thread handles and status so that orchestrator or downstream scriptlets can join or cancel threads gracefully.

3. Multiprocessing/ProcessPool Support
Expand for heavy computation or safe isolation by supporting Python’s multiprocessing or even external job server integration.

4. Resource Monitoring
Integrate psutil to log per-task CPU and memory statistics in the trace log (see framework’s resource gathering utilities).

5. Trace expiry and Cleanup
Add expiry/GC for old trace entries to prevent unbounded ctx growth in long-lived apps.

6. User Tagging for Audit/Traceability
Allow passing a "who" or "step_name" to store the logical initiator alongside the trace (useful for audit or collaborative environments).

7. Progress Reporting
Enable reporting intermediate progress with optional periodic updates from the background task (by yielding or periodic ctx update).

8. Retry, Backoff, and Robust Failure Logic
Permit built-in retries or backoff with user settings, optionally logging each attempt and the final outcome to the trace.

9. Dash/Dashboard Widget Utilities
Create helper visualization in Dash that display, filter, and alert on active/incomplete/failed bg-trace jobs in real time.

10. Distributed/Remote Tracing
For multi-node/job server/cluster contexts, permit trace logs to be sent to a central endpoint, database, or event bus (extensible with minimal changes).

Best Practice & Compliance Tips
Always use JSON-serializable objects in ctx (“data compliance”).

Document all uses and parameters, especially function signatures expected at fn for traceability and error prevention.

Use clear, descriptive keys and trace_key values for each task or domain.

When packing functions for background tasks, ensure no closure or reference leaks to avoid orphaned jobs.

Integrate with ctx[’trace’], ctx[’audit’], and orchestrator’s built-in logs for unified reporting.

Use together with error decorators and audit/context managers for robust, traceable recipes.

In summary:
ctx_bg_trace.py offers foundational trace and log support for any orchestrator workflow seeking robust, auditable, and reusable background or concurrent job management—embeddable in recipes, scriptlets, dashboards, and unit/integration testing. It is an ideal starting point for expanding toward full-featured async and process monitoring in production-quality automation pipelines.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_bg_job.py — Documentation and Analysis
Objective
Automate the management of background jobs in the orchestrator workflow by running Python functions in a separate thread, asynchronously.

Track job status, results, output, and errors directly within the shared ctx in-memory state to support real-time dashboards, job monitoring, and robust orchestration.

Support multiple concurrent or queued jobs, enabling efficient multi-step or long-running workflows without blocking the main process.

Description
The scriptlet defines a run(ctx, params) function which:

Accepts a unique job_id, a function fn, and optional arguments args.

Launches the specified function in a background thread.

Tracks job status, start/end time, result, and any exceptions under ctx["jobs"][job_id].

Can be extended for process pools, non-blocking pools, or distributed task execution.

Workflow:

The job begins in "running" state, logging start time.

If the function returns successfully:

Status is set to "done", results and end time are recorded.

On error:

Status is set to "error", exception info and end time are logged.

Technologies Used:

Python threading (for asynchronous execution)

Python time (for timestamping and duration)

Dependencies
Standard Library:

threading (for starting a background thread)

time (for capturing start/end timestamps)

Framework Integration:

Relies on orchestrator’s ctx (shared context, must be a dict-like object)

Requires the function to run be callable (e.g., regular or lambda function) and arguments JSON-serializable if returned to ctx.

Applications & Integrations
Applications:

Offloading long-running or blocking tasks from the main orchestrator control flow.

Scheduling and executing concurrent analytics, reporting, or file I/O steps.

Integrating with Dash or CLI tools for real-time job progress updates / status displays.

Supporting job monitoring, job queuing, and resilience in complex test or ETL pipelines.

Integrations:

Can be composed with other orchestrator steps for dynamic workflows.

Pairs with ctx_job_status.py to query background job status/results.

Can be used in recipes via:

text
- name: start_bg_calc
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_bg_job
  function: run
  params:
    job_id: "fast_sum"
    fn: my_sum_func
    args:
        a: 1
        b: 2
Limitations
In-memory only: All state is present only in ctx and will not persist upon orchestrator or machine failure unless explicitly saved.

Thread-based: Not suitable for jobs requiring heavy CPU-bound work in Python due to GIL (suggestion: extend to use multiprocessing for such cases).

Simple queue: No built-in queueing, dependency, or retry logic (unlike distributed frameworks).

Result serialization: Only JSON-serializable results should be saved to ctx.

Scriptlet independence: Only jobs defined as Python functions callable from within the orchestrator’s process can be run; no support for running arbitrary system or shell commands.

No status callbacks: The orchestrator must poll ctx["jobs"] to detect job completion or errors—no notification/event bus.

Error handling: Only sets status and error string; does not raise errors to main orchestrator flow.

Usage Examples
1. Minimal / Direct Example
Launch a job in the background which returns an integer.

python
def my_func(x, y):
    return x + y

params = {
    "job_id": "add_task",
    "fn": my_func,
    "args": {"x": 2, "y": 3}
}
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_bg_job as bgjob
ctx = {}
bgjob.run(ctx, params)
# ctx["jobs"]["add_task"] will eventually have status/result fields
2. Recipe Step in YAML

text
- idx: 3
  name: long_background_task
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_bg_job
  function: run
  params:
    job_id: "my_task"
    fn: my_python_func           # Must be available in current orchestrator’s Python path
    args:
      a: 1
      b: 10
Check status in another step:

text
- idx: 4
  name: check_bg_job_status
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_job_status
  function: run
  params:
    job_id: "my_task"
3. Multiple Parallel Jobs

python
def foo(x): return x * x
def bar(y): return y - 2

# Start two jobs
ctx = {}
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_bg_job as bgjob
bgjob.run(ctx, {"job_id": "sq", "fn": foo, "args": {"x": 9}})
bgjob.run(ctx, {"job_id": "decr", "fn": bar, "args": {"y": 5}})
# Later: ctx["jobs"]["sq"] and ctx["jobs"]["decr"] will have results
4. CLI and Manual Testing
This scriptlet is callable only as a module, not as a CLI. However, you could write:

bash
python -c "import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_bg_job as cbj; \
    ctx={}; cbj.run(ctx, {'job_id': 'demo','fn': lambda : 42,'args':{}}); print(ctx)"
(But note: you generally provide normal, importable function, not a lambda when using with YAML recipes.)

5. Checking Status in Dash
Show running/completed jobs in Dash by looping over ctx["jobs"] (with polling / callback refresh).

Recommendations for Enhancement
Based on the workspace standards, best practices, and extensibility criteria:

1. Add Job Queueing, Retries, and Dependency Management
Implement a job queue within ctx["jobs"], enabling job dependencies, priorities, or batch submission.

Provide retry logic (optional delay, exponential or fixed) for robust automation.

2. Extend for CPU-Bound Work
Add a flag to choose between thread and process-based (multiprocessing) jobs.

For heavy computation, offload to a process pool managed via concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.

3. Enable Progress and Heartbeats
Allow background task to report progress to ctx["jobs"][job_id]["progress"] and/or last activity timestamp for advanced status monitoring/dashboards.

4. CLI Wrapper or Standalone Mode
Add if __name__ == "__main__": CLI for direct, testable use, such as:

text
python ctx_bg_job.py --job_id test_job --fn myfunc --args '{"a":1}'
Allow running arbitrary importable function via argument, or at least sensible demo/test mode.

5. Job Output Logging and Auditing
Log stdout/stderr and errors for each job, and optionally save logs to disk (as with other orchestrator per-step logs).

Append audit entries into ctx["audit"] for each job’s execution (job_id, params, start, end, duration, status).

6. Unified Event Notification
Push completed/failed job events to ctx["events"] for use in dashboards, notifications, or webhook integration.

7. Support Run-time Cancellation and Pause
Expose an API to set a cancellation flag in ctx["jobs"][job_id]["cancel"] and have jobs check/poll and terminate cleanly.

8. Add Strict Schema/Type-Checking Option
Use the workspace pattern for ctx_validate.py to ensure returned results and job status objects are always JSON-serializable.

Optionally, define allowed structure for job description in ctx/audit.

9. Finer-Grained Job Abstraction
Add a Job class/registry for advanced scheduling, progress, and extended life-cycle events (submitted, queued, running, success, error, cancelled, etc.).

10. Documentation and Discoverability
Use dynamic or static docstring/usage block at the top with explicit examples/caveats (already present in your codebase for most scriptlets).

Integrate with framework’s CLI listing/documentation system so job schemes/types are easily discoverable.

Tips for Using/Extending ctx_bg_job.py
Always provide unique job_id for each task.

Prefer stateless, idempotent functions, as jobs could be retried if needed.

For cross-session jobs, manually persist ctx using existing serializing utilities.

Use in combination with event bus or notification scriptlets for automation feedback loops.

To avoid blocking, ensure jobs and context mutations are thread-safe if sharing context between many background jobs.

Combine with audit log scriptlets for robust traceability and compliance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_audit_report.py — Documentation & Best Practices
Objective
ctx_audit_report.py is a core utility scriptlet for generating a human-readable audit trail summarizing the execution of orchestrator steps. It transforms ctx["audit"] (a list tracking step execution metadata) into a clean Markdown report file, suitable for traceability, compliance, review, and debugging within automation pipelines.

Description
This scriptlet is designed to run either as a CLI or as part of an orchestrator pipeline (runner.py), and performs the following:

Aggregates and formats all step audit entries from the shared context (typically stored in ctx["audit"]).

Outputs a Markdown report summarizing each pipeline step (step name, timings, status, error reasons, duration, etc).

Produces this report for archiving, sharing with stakeholders, or integrating into automated documentation workflows.

Enables easy auditability: who did what, when, and how long did each step take, with visible error information if something failed.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library: No third-party packages are required.

File I/O (open)

List/dictionary comprehensions

String formatting

Context: Relies on well-structured ctx, specifically on presence and content of ctx["audit"].

Orchestrator Compatibility: Follows all workspace requirements:

Accepts/requires a dict-like ctx and a params dict with at least out (output filename).

Returns structured results for the orchestrator runner.

Application, Integration, and Usage
Application Scenarios
End-of-pipeline reporting: Called as the final step in a recipe to produce an audit artifact for the test run.

CI/CD and compliance: Used to create execution summaries for audits, debugging, or regulatory reporting.

Debugging: Makes it simple to see when/where a pipeline failed, and why, without trawling raw logs.

Example Integration
As a pipeline step in a YAML recipe:

text
- idx: 100
  name: generate_audit_report
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_audit_report
  function: run
  params:
    out: Data/audit_report.md
  depends_on: [all_previous_steps]
As a standalone function call in custom orchestrator code:

python
import scriptlets.python.core.ctx_audit_report as ctx_audit_report

ctx = {
  "audit": [
    {
      "step": "normalize_data",
      "start": 1663000000,
      "end": 1663000003,
      "duration": 3.0,
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "step": "compute_stats",
      "start": 1663000050,
      "end": 1663000060,
      "duration": 10.0,
      "status": "error",
      "error": "division by zero"
    }
  ]
}
ctx_audit_report.run(ctx, {"out": "Data/audit_report.md"})
Detailed Usage Examples
Minimal Case: All Steps Successful

python
ctx = {
  "audit": [
    {"step": "download_data", "start": 1663000000, "end": 1663000002, "duration": 2.0, "status": "success"},
    {"step": "analyze", "start": 1663000003, "end": 1663000005, "duration": 2.0, "status": "success"}
  ]
}

# Generates a markdown report at Data/audit_report.md with each step's timing and status.
ctx_audit_report.run(ctx, {"out": "Data/audit_report.md"})
Sample output in Data/audit_report.md:

text
# Audit Report

## Step: download_data
- Start: 1663000000
- End: 1663000002
- Duration: 2.00 sec
- Status: success

## Step: analyze
- Start: 1663000003
- End: 1663000005
- Duration: 2.00 sec
- Status: success
With Errors:

If a step fails, it will be included and labeled:

python
ctx = {
  "audit": [
    {"step": "db_insert", "start": 1663000000, "end": 1663000099, "duration": 99.0, "status": "error", "error": "connection timed out"}
  ]
}
ctx_audit_report.run(ctx, {"out": "Data/audit_report.md"})
Sample output:

text
# Audit Report

## Step: db_insert
- Start: 1663000000
- End: 1663000099
- Duration: 99.00 sec
- Status: error
- Error: connection timed out
As Last Step in a Recipe:

text
# ... previous steps ...
- idx: 99
  name: finalize_audit
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_audit_report
  function: run
  params:
    out: Data/audit_report.md
  depends_on: [all_other_steps]
CLI-Like Usage (Though Not Explicitly a CLI Script):

shell
# Suppose you use python -c to invoke:
python -c "
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_audit_report
ctx = {'audit': [{'step': 'A', 'status': 'success', 'start': 1, 'end': 2, 'duration': 1.0}]}
ctx_audit_report.run(ctx, {'out': 'audit.md'})"
# 'audit.md' will have a Markdown audit report.
Empty or Missing Audit Data:
If ctx["audit"] is empty or missing, the report will simply have a header with no steps.

Limitations & Requirements
Assumes ctx["audit"] is a list of dicts: Each dict should minimally have keys: "step", "start", "end", "duration", "status", and optionally "error".

No schema validation: Does not check for missing fields. If fields are missing, fields will simply be omitted or shown as blanks.

Only outputs Markdown (.md): No direct support for HTML or other formats (recommendation below).

No data sorting: The report is generated in the order of entries in ctx["audit"].

No aggregation or statistics: Purely a per-step dump, not summary statistics or visualizations.

No CLI help or argument parsing: Only callable as a Python function through the orchestrator.

Enhancement & Recommendation Section
General Best Practices
Call as the last step of a recipe to produce an end-of-run audit log.

Ensure that all pipeline steps (possibly via a decorator/context manager pattern) append detailed entries to ctx["audit"], including errors, timings, and meaningful status messages.

Use clear, descriptive step names for traceability.

Recommended Enhancements
1. Add Output Format Flexibility (Support HTML, CSV, or JSON)

Add a format parameter (default "md"). Enable output as "md", "csv", or "json".

For "csv", each step becomes a row.

For "json", output the whole list as JSON, for integration with dashboards or downstream systems.

2. Add Optional Aggregates & Summary Section

Compute and include:

Total steps, total duration

Steps succeeded/failed

Average duration per step

Earliest start and latest end time

3. Schema Validation/Safety

Add validation: check each audit entry for required fields and fill with N/A if missing.

4. Sort Steps by Start Time or Name (Configurable)

Add a sort_by param for the report — helpful if steps may be appended in parallel or out-of-order.

5. Enhanced Formatting (Markdown Table or Collapsible Blocks)

For large pipelines, format as markdown tables or collapsible sections for readability.

6. Integrate with Notification or Logging

Extend the scriptlet to send the audit report (or a link) via email, Slack, etc., using other available scriptlets (see ctx_notify.py).

7. Customizable Human-Readable Dates

Convert Unix epoch seconds into human-readable formatted dates/times, if provided as such.

8. Include Step Parameters in the Report (if available)

If entries in ctx["audit"] have "params", optionally list parameters for full trace.

9. Add CLI Wrapper (if direct CLI needed)

(Optional) Add a wrapper so python ctx_audit_report.py --infile ctx_audit.json --out report.md can be used during debugging.

10. Integrated Visualization

Optionally, export a Graphviz or chart showing step timings, durations, and dependencies (using the graphviz package already available).

Example (Markdown Table Section):
text
| Step Name      | Status   | Start        | End          | Duration (s) | Error Reason        |
|----------------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| load_data      | success  | 2025-08-26   | 2025-08-26   | 0.20         |                     |
| normalize_data | error    | 2025-08-26   | 2025-08-26   | 2.30         | division by zero    |
Example Enhanced Function Signature
python
def run(ctx, params):
    out = params["out"]
    fmt = params.get("format", "md")
    sort_by = params.get("sort_by", "start")
    summary = params.get("summary", True)
    # Implementation for multi-format goes here...
Conclusion
ctx_audit_report.py is a critical component for run transparency, root-cause analysis, and compliance in your orchestrator framework. As pipelines and requirements scale, making this step more robust, richer in reporting, and easily extendable (formats, summaries, validation, integration with notifications) will maximize both automation and audit utility, all while honoring your strict workspace criteria for modular, transparent, and maintainable scriptlets.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
File: scriptlets/python/core/ctx_async.py
Objective
Enable execution of time-consuming or blocking Python functions in the background (as a thread), so that main orchestration and dashboard UIs (such as Dash) remain responsive. This helps offload lengthy operations (data processing, loading, etc.) to a separate thread and asynchronously update the shared in-memory context (ctx) when finished.

Description
Implements a utility function to run any fn(**args) in a separate thread, assigning its result to a given ctx[key] once finished.

Returns immediately after starting the thread (does not block the main process), allowing the orchestrator, test sequence, or dashboard to continue running.

Example: While a large file is loading or a computation runs in the background, Dash remains interactive and can show a spinner or pending status.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library Only

threading

Workspace Requirements

The workspace must ensure only JSON-serializable objects are stored to ctx.

The orchestrator must maintain thread-safe access to ctx if extended to real concurrency-sensitive use cases.

Applications and Integrations
Dash Application: Run background data processing jobs while keeping UI responsive (e.g., live charting/data polling).

Recipe Step: As a core utility, can be invoked from pipeline steps where long-running work should not block other steps.

Scriptlet Integration: Meant to be imported and called anywhere another scriptlet wants non-blocking, responsive operation.

Limitations
Threading Model

No return value is immediately available (result written to ctx[key] upon thread completion).

Not suitable for CPU-bound tasks requiring full multi-core parallelism (use multiprocessing techniques for those).

No Error Handling

Exceptions in the background thread are not captured or logged in ctx unless you add try/except logic in fn.

No Completion Notification

Caller must poll or watch ctx[key] to detect when the operation is done.

Single-Task Simplicity

One fn per call. For job queues or ID-based job management, see ctx_bg_job.py or ctx_job_queue.py.

Non-Blocking

Main orchestrator is not notified directly when the thread finishes unless you add further notification logic (e.g., events or callbacks).

Thread Safety

If your ctx contains non-thread-safe data structures or you use complex patterns, you must take additional measures.

Usage
Basic Example: Run Heavy Computation in Background
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_async

def long_running_sum(a, b):
    import time
    time.sleep(5)  # simulate a long computation
    return a + b

ctx = {}
ctx_async.run(ctx, {"key": "result", "fn": long_running_sum, "args": {"a": 10, "b": 20}})
print("Computation started in background...")

# Later, poll or check ctx["result"]
# (after ~5 seconds, ctx["result"] == 30)
Example: Use in a Dash Callback for Async Data Loading
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_async

def load_large_data(filepath):
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.read_csv(filepath).to_dict(orient="records")

ctx = {}
ctx_async.run(ctx, {"key": "data", "fn": load_large_data, "args": {"filepath": "big.csv"}})

# In Dash callback, periodically check ctx["data"] for completion.
Example: Launch Several Background Tasks
python
# Not directly supported by ctx_async.py, but could call multiple times
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_async

for i in range(5):
    ctx_async.run(ctx, {
        "key": f"task_result_{i}",
        "fn": lambda x: x**2,
        "args": {"x": i}
    })
Example: Error Handling (Manual)
python
def may_fail(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("No zero division!")
    return a / b

def safe_may_fail(a, b):
    try:
        return may_fail(a, b)
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}

ctx_async.run(ctx, {"key": "safe_result", "fn": safe_may_fail, "args": {"a": 1, "b": 0}})
# ctx["safe_result"] will contain {"error": "..."}
Example: Triggering Notification When Done
python
def finished_loader():
    # ... load stuff
    ctx["loading_status"] = "done"  # UI or other scriptlets can watch this flag

ctx_async.run(ctx, {"key": "background_result", "fn": finished_loader, "args": {}})
Recommendations & Suggestions for Future Expansion
1. Status and Error Tracking

Store progress and error state in ctx, e.g.:

ctx["background_jobs"]["job_id"] = {"status": "running"/"done"/"error", "result": ...}

Add job id/name to params, track per-job.

2. Completion Notification

Add optional callback for completion or set an event in ctx (e.g., append {"event": "job_done"} to ctx["events"]).

Automatically log activity via ctx_logger.py or ctx_trace.py.

3. Allow Chaining and Awaiting Results

Support for callback chaining (run next step when finished).

Optionally provide a simple polling or event mechanism for waiting on background task completion.

4. Improved API

Add support for returning thread object/handle for advanced management.

Allow passing a "job_id" and store thread references and statuses in ctx for easier tracking/cancellation.

5. Resource Limiting

Add optional limits on number of concurrent threads (thread pool).

6. Error Propagation

Automatically catch and write uncaught exceptions to ctx["errors"].

7. Progress Reporting

Support reporting progress (e.g. ctx["progress"] = percent) from within the target function via function hooks or shared object.

8. Thread Safety and Concurrency

Wrap ctx updates in locks if multiple threads may write complex objects.

Consider using process-based parallelism (concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor) for CPU-bound or truly isolated work.

9. CLI Entry Point

Make ctx_async.py runnable as a CLI for demo/debug, reporting when background execution is started and polling for status.

10. Documentation and Testing

Add detailed docstring (see below for suggested template).

Supply corresponding unit/integration test (see your tests/ examples).

Example Docstring for ctx_async.py
python
"""
ctx_async.py
------------
Runs a function in a background thread and updates ctx when done.

Objective:
    Offload heavy ctx operations to background threads to keep main processes and UIs responsive.

Usage:
    run(ctx, {"key": "result", "fn": my_fn, "args": {...}})

Arguments:
    ctx: dict - shared in-memory context
    params:
      key: str - where result is stored in ctx
      fn: callable - function to run in background
      args: dict (optional) - arguments supplied to fn

Returns:
    {"started": True}

Limitations:
    - Result is only available through ctx[key] after function completes.
    - No built-in error/state tracking or job ID.
    - No result returned directly.

Examples:
    >>> def load_big(): ...
    >>> ctx_async.run(ctx, {"key": "data", "fn": load_big, "args": {}})
    # ctx["data"] will contain result later

    # For error capture:
    >>> def fn(): try: ...; except Exception as e: return {"err": str(e)}
    >>> ctx_async.run(ctx, {"key": "...", "fn": fn, ...})

Recommended Enhancements:
    - Add status tracking, job IDs, error reporting, event notification, and progress.

"""
Summary
ctx_async.py is a lightweight utility for non-blocking, background function execution, writing results to the orchestrator context.

Use it when you need main compute/data pipelines or Dash dashboards to remain interactive during expensive tasks.

For richer workflow scenarios, consider augmenting it with error/status tracking (ctx_bg_job.py), resource control, or result/event chaining, always ensuring JSON-serializability and thread-safety for ctx.

Maintain compliance with the orchestrator’s rules on logging, traceability, and independence for easy unit testing and debugging.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ctx_assert.py — Documentation
Objective
Purpose:
Provide a reusable, atomic utility to programmatically verify conditions on the shared in-memory context (ctx) at any pipeline step, supporting robust validation, debugging, and gating logic within recipes and scriptlets.

Goal:
Facilitate error detection, quality assurance, and logging by asserting ctx keys’ values against expected results; integrate tightly with logging for step-level and global traceability.

Description
ctx_assert.py is a Python step utility enabling inline assertions in Orchestrator workflows.

It checks if a particular ctx key matches an expected value. On failure, it raises an AssertionError and attaches a detailed log entry to ctx["log"].

Compliance with framework:

Only JSON-serializable objects are checked/logged.

Atomic and reusable: can be called as a single step in recipes, or from other scriptlets.

No side effects beyond logging and exception on failed assertion.

Traceable: automatically logs both successful and failed assertions.

Dependencies/Requirements
Python version: 3.6+

Standard Library Only

No external dependencies required.

Designed for maximum portability and testability.

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
Direct usage in recipes (atomic step):
Insert as a step to verify pipeline invariants and data integrity (e.g., after data transforms, before reporting/export).

Programmatic usage from other scriptlets:

For defensive programming inside custom logic (to halt early on invalid states).

In unit and integration tests for ctx validation.

Logging:
All results (OK/failure) appear in ctx["log"] with timestamp and level.

Limitations
Scope:

Only checks for equality; no support for inequality, type-only, or compound assertions by default.

Key Existence:

Will return None for missing keys; may result in failed assertion if expected is not also None.

Serializability:

Only JSON-serializable values should be stored/compared.

Failure Mechanism:

Scriptlet halts execution with AssertionError on failure unless caught in a controller or try/except block; no fallback or warning-only mode.

Single Key:

Only asserts a single key per call (batch/multiple-keys not supported out-of-the-box).

Usage
1. As a Recipe Step (YAML)
text
- name: assert_normalization
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_assert
  function: run
  params:
    key: "data_normalized"
    expected: true
  # Fails the pipeline if normalization has not succeeded
2. Basic Example (Python Scriptlet/CLI)
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_assert

ctx = {"stage_status": "done"}
result = ctx_assert.run(ctx, {"key": "stage_status", "expected": "done"})
# Returns: {"asserted": True}
3. Failing Case (Python Scriptlet/CLI)
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_assert

ctx = {"value": 7}
try:
    ctx_assert.run(ctx, {"key": "value", "expected": 42})
except AssertionError as e:
    print("Assertion raised:", e)
# Result: raises AssertionError, logs to ctx["log"]
4. In a Unit Test
python
import pytest
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_assert

def test_ctx_assert_valid():
    ctx = {"x": 1}
    result = ctx_assert.run(ctx, {"key": "x", "expected": 1})
    assert result["asserted"] is True

def test_ctx_assert_invalid():
    ctx = {"y": 99}
    with pytest.raises(AssertionError):
        ctx_assert.run(ctx, {"key": "y", "expected": 42})
5. With Logging Inspection
python
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_assert

ctx = {"item_count": 20, "log": []}
try:
    ctx_assert.run(ctx, {"key": "item_count", "expected": 10})
except AssertionError:
    print(ctx["log"][-1])
# Outputs: entry in ctx["log"] describing failed assertion
Recommendation: Tips and Suggestions for Expansion
1. Support Additional Assert Types and Operators
Enhance to allow optional parameter "op": "eq"|"ne"|"gt"|"lt"|"ge"|"le"|"in"|"not_in":

Example usage:

python
ctx_assert.run(ctx, {"key": "val", "expected": 100, "op": "gt"})
# Asserts ctx["val"] > 100
Add an optional "message" field for custom error/logging output.

2. Batch and Compound Assertions
Allow passing a list of {key, expected, op} dictionaries:

Example usage:

python
run(ctx, {"checks": [
  {"key": "x", "expected": 1},
  {"key": "status", "expected": "done", "op": "eq"}
]})
# Fail on first failed assertion, or allow checking all and collecting errors
3. Warning-Only Mode
Add "strict": False parameter, so assertion logs at WARNING and does not raise, optionally used for non-blocking checks.

4. Type Checking and Validation
Allow optional "type": int|float|dict|list|str|..." for not just value equivalence but also type enforcement.

5. Integration with Recipe Validation Logic
Create a companion scriptlet for pre/post-conditions to be checked before/after recipe steps (“assert all these keys/types/values after this step”).

6. Detailed Traceability
Include step name, function, and user-supplied tags in assertion logs for auditability.

Incorporate ctx.get_history(key) if available, to report previous changes on failed assertion.

7. CLI/Standalone Mode
Accept CLI arguments (--key, --expected, --op, etc.) for command-line integration/testing, printing pass/fail output to stdout/stderr and exporting logs.

8. Auto-Documentation
Add auto-generated usage/help string that can be listed from a CLI or API endpoint (aligning with framework discoverability goals).

9. Extensibility Pattern
Use a registry or plugin system to allow user-defined assertion functions (for checks like regex match, etc.) to be plugged in without modifying the core logic.

Add decorators to allow ctx_assert to wrap any user-provided function with assertion before/after (for composable test-driven scripting).

Summary of Key Benefits
Testability: Standardizes robust validation in every workflow and scriptlet.

Traceability: All assertion results are logged for full audit/history.

Composability & Compliance: Modular as a scriptlet/MW step, extensible and framework-aligned.

Easy Debugging: Immediate, clear feedback on logic/data errors at runtime.

Adopting and extending ctx_assert.py as described above will make it a central, reusable, and extensible building block for data and run-time integrity across all orchestrator workflows!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation: ctx_ai_llm.py
Objective
Integrate a Language Model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT models, into the orchestrator workflow.

Produce summarized text, code, or AI-generated insight from context (ctx) data as an atomic, reusable step.

Store LLM output within ctx for subsequent recipe steps, reporting, or dashboard display.

Provide a template for AI-powered scriptlets to enable general-purpose data analysis and AI processing within automated pipelines.

Description
ctx_ai_llm.py is a Python scriptlet for the orchestrator automation framework that connects shared context (ctx) data to a large language model (LLM), such as OpenAI’s GPT series. It sends the value of a specified key from ctx to the model as input, along with a prompt/instruction, and saves the LLM's response under another specified key in ctx.

This enables recipes to:

Summarize analysis results.

Generate insights in natural language.

Transform structured data into plain language reports.

Use AI to describe, critique, or extend any ctx content inline within workflows.

Key features:

Modular, single-responsibility, JSON-serializable context management.

LLM and model selection via function arguments.

Output always tracked in ctx, enabling downstream use by dashboards, reporters, or further scriptlets.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+

openai (pip install openai)

Requires a valid OpenAI API key available as the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable (or configured globally).

Standard library: typing for type declarations (optional, for clarity).

Applications & Integrations
Automated Report Generation: Automatically produce narrative summaries from data pipeline outputs, making them suitable for business reports, dashboards, or communications.

Pipeline QA and Review: Use LLMs to perform sanity checks, error explanations, or QA summaries on intermediate data.

Automated Data Description: Generate "executive summary," "key points," or "trend explanations" for analytics or scientific workflows.

Enriching Dashboards: Combine with Dash or other visualization apps for inline AI-generated overviews or tooltips.

Recipe Integration: Insert as a single step anywhere in a YAML recipe, referencing any data present in ctx.

Sample usage within a recipe:

text
- name: ai_summarize_metrics
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_ai_llm
  function: run
  params:
    key: "metrics"
    out: "metrics_summary"
    prompt: "Summarize the following metrics for a project update."
Limitations
LLM output is unvalidated: The scriptlet stores the LLM's reply as-is; always validate sensitive or critical content.

Internet and API key required: Fails if the OpenAI service or key is unavailable.

Cost & API rate limits: Each call consumes tokens and may be rate-limited by OpenAI based on plan.

Input Size Constraints: Large data in ctx[key] will be serialized with str(data) (could be truncated by model context limits, >4K tokens).

Prompt engineering may be needed: The quality of the result depends on the prompt used.

No native multi-language or non-OpenAI support as written (can be expanded).

Output is plain text: Downstream processing is responsible for further parsing or transformations.

Usage
Function signature
python
def run(ctx, params):
    key = params["key"]           # ctx key: data to summarize or describe
    out = params["out"]           # ctx key: where to store LLM output
    prompt = params["prompt"]     # Instruction for the LLM
    # Optionally, params["model"] (defaults to "gpt-3.5-turbo")

    params:
      key: "metrics"
      out: "metrics_ai_summary"
      prompt: "Rewrite these test metrics as a brief QA update. List outliers."
Recommendations & Tips for Enhancement
Support for More Models and Services

Add function parameter for model (already partially supported) and API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, local models) by abstracting the completion logic.

Make the provider selectable, e.g., provider: openai|anthropic|local, and adapt API calls accordingly.

Structured Output

Add support to parse/return not only text but also JSON. Encourage prompts like:
"Respond with a JSON object containing { 'summary': ..., 'risk': ..., 'recommendation': ... }"

Optionally, add a parameter for output_format: json|text.

Streaming or Chunked Calls for Large Data

If input is large, batch or window the data, aggregate responses, and summarize for the final output.

Validation and Post-Processing

Add an optional validation or post-processing function to check/clean the LLM output (e.g., regex for numbers, code safety check).

Allow passing in a "post_fn" param or hook for further processing.

Error Handling Improvements

Catch and wrap OpenAI API exceptions.

Return errors in a standard way in ctx, e.g., ctx["llm_errors"].

Prompt Library and Modular Prompt Engineering

Allow the use of pre-defined named prompts (e.g., "summarize_data", "explain_error") to promote consistency and versioning.

Multi-Step or Chain of Prompts

Chain multiple LLM calls, storing each result in ctx for recipes needing progressive summarization or Q&A.

Integration with Audit/Trace

Auto-log every LLM call and response in ctx["audit"] or ctx["trace"] with timestamp and params, to ensure full traceability.

Recipe Template/Generator

Provide CLI helpers or a Python utility to generate recipe stubs for common LLM use cases (summarization, code suggestion, translation, etc.).

Security

If used for code generation, never execute LLM-supplied code automatically without review/validation.

Best Practices and Tips
Keep prompts short and explicit. The quality of the AI response heavily depends on prompt clarity and constraints.

Log all LLM input/output in debug mode for traceability and audit (already a workspace standard).

Validate and review outputs. Use a human-in-the-loop for critical decisions.

Guard against leaking sensitive data via prompts, especially when using cloud models.

Store LLM costs and stats in ctx for budgeting and monitoring.

By adhering to this structure, you ensure that your orchestrator framework remains robust, extensible, and friendly to both non-programmers and advanced users.
Expanding ctx_ai_llm.py with the above recommendations will future-proof your pipeline's AI/LLM integration, enable transparency, and tightly integrate it with proven orchestration standards for traceability, reusability, and performance.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
scriptlets/python/core/chain_recipes.py – Documentation
Objective
The objective of chain_recipes.py is to chain (concatenate/merge) steps from two separate orchestrator recipe YAML files into a new, combined recipe. This utility enables modular workflow composition and easy reuse and integration of pre-existing recipes, supporting scalable pipeline design and maintainability.

Description
Functionality:
The chain_recipes.py scriptlet provides a function to merge the steps from two orchestrator recipe files into one. It reads the steps lists from both input YAML files, concatenates them, and writes the resulting set of steps into a new output recipe YAML.

Design:

Reads both input YAML recipes: recipe1 and recipe2.

Extracts their steps (lists of orchestrator step dictionaries).

Merges these step lists together, respecting their order: all steps from the first recipe are listed before those from the second recipe.

Outputs a new YAML recipe containing all steps under a new file.

Dependencies
Python Standard Library:

yaml (from PyYAML - required, as specified in requirements.txt)

Filesystem:

Read permission to input recipe YAMLs and write permission for target output YAML.

Orchestrator Context:

Can operate within orchestrator as a scriptlet or be ported for CLI use with minimal wrapping.

Application and Integration
Applications:

Modularization: Build reusable and composable recipes for automated pipelines.

Maintenance: Keep atomic sub-workflows as separate files, and combine them on the fly for end-to-end runs.

Experimentation: Quickly mix and match parts of workflows without duplicating recipe definitions.

Integration:

Can be called as a step within a larger orchestrator recipe, allowing dynamic recipe assembly during a workflow.

Usable directly via run(ctx, params) by any orchestrator Python-based step.

Output recipes can be further edited/validated or run as-is by the main orchestrator runner.

Limitations
Basic concatenation:

Only concatenates the steps lists. It does not automatically resolve step name conflicts, idx uniqueness, or dependency (depends_on) re-mapping.

Other sections:

Preserves only the steps blocks; test metadata (test_meta) or other top-level fields (e.g., description) are not merged, potentially losing useful context or documentation.

No deduplication or conflict detection:

Duplicate step names, indices, or parameter overlaps between recipes are not automatically resolved.

Not CLI-oriented:

No direct command-line wrapper; expects execution via Python/in-orchestrator context.

Static merge:

Does not allow selective step extraction—only merges all steps from both inputs (though this could be adapted).

No validation:

Does not validate the merged recipe for orchestration correctness or dependency cycles.

Usage Examples
Python Scriptlet Usage
python
from scriptlets.python.core import chain_recipes

ctx = {}
params = {
    "recipe1": "recipes/preproc.yaml",
    "recipe2": "recipes/analysis.yaml",
    "out": "recipes/combined_pipeline.yaml"
}
result = chain_recipes.run(ctx, params)
print(result)
Orchestrator Recipe Step
text
- name: merge_my_recipes
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.chain_recipes
  function: run
  params:
    recipe1: recipes/data_ingest.yaml
    recipe2: recipes/postproc.yaml
    out: recipes/my_combined_pipeline.yaml
Quick Example on the Filesystem
Given:

recipes/a.yaml:

text
steps:
  - idx: 1
    name: load_data
    type: shell
    cmd: scriptlets/shell/load.sh
    args: [...]
recipes/b.yaml:

text
steps:
  - idx: 2
    name: compute_stats
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.core.stats
    function: run
    params: {...}
Running with:

python
run(ctx, {'recipe1': 'recipes/a.yaml', 'recipe2': 'recipes/b.yaml', 'out': 'recipes/ab.yaml'})
Produces:

text
steps:
  - idx: 1
    name: load_data
    type: shell
    cmd: scriptlets/shell/load.sh
    args: [...]
  - idx: 2
    name: compute_stats
    type: python
    module: scriptlets.python.core.stats
    function: run
    params: {...}
Dynamic Pipelines in Recipes
You can even generate new recipe files as part of a meta-workflow, then execute them using the runner in a downstream step.

Recommendations & Tips for Expansion
Best Practices
Enforce Unique Step Names & Indices:
Add logic to the scriptlet to:

Detect duplicate step names or idx conflicts.

Optionally, auto-increment or remap indices to ensure uniqueness.

Merge Metadata
Extend chaining to include test_meta and other top-level fields. Allow param to select merge strategy: prefer first, prefer second, or merge as dict.

Selective Step Inclusion
Allow the user to specify only a subset of steps from each input via new parameters:

python
run(ctx, {
    "recipe1": ..., "recipe2": ...,
    "steps1": ["load", "sanity_check"],
    "steps2": ["metrics"],
    "out": ...
})
Dependency Rewiring
If step names/indices are remapped, also rewrite all depends_on fields accordingly to preserve workflow logic.

Conflict/Validation Reporting
After merging, report on any conflicts and validate the invariants (acyclic dependencies, unique names/indices).

CLI Wrapper
Provide a standalone command-line entrypoint, e.g.:

bash
python scriptlets/python/core/chain_recipes.py --recipe1 a.yaml --recipe2 b.yaml --out ab.yaml
Step Annotation/Labeling
Optionally allow annotating steps with new tags or trace markers indicating original source recipe (for auditability).

Integrated Testing
Provide test cases (see tests/test_x.py patterns) verifying correct merging for a range of scenario (conflicts, empty recipes, etc).

Sample Enhanced Function Signature
python
def run(
    ctx, params
):
    '''
    params = {
        "recipe1": ...,
        "recipe2": ...,
        "out": ...,
        "steps1": [...],    # optional, subset by name or idx
        "steps2": [...],    # optional
        "merge_meta": "first" | "second" | "merge",  # how to combine test_meta etc.
        "auto_reindex": True, # auto-fix idx
        "conflict_strategy": "error" | "rename" | "skip"
    }
    '''
    ...
Summary of Suggested Expansion Features
Auto-detect and resolve step name/index conflicts

Merge or combine top-level (non-steps) fields (like test_meta)

Select only subsets of steps from each recipe

Rewrite dependencies post-merge to maintain DAG correctness

Validate full output against orchestrator’s expectations before writing

Provide command-line invocable version with similar arguments

Annotate, trace, or record the provenance of each step in merged outputs

Include integrated tests and usage demos with the code

By following these tips, you can turn chain_recipes.py from a basic utility into a robust composition tool that fits the orchestrator framework’s emphasis on reusability, traceability, and robust automation workflows.
------------------------------------------------------------------
__init__.py Documentation for Orchestrator Workspace
Objective
Core Purpose:
Enable Python package structure and explicit module discovery within the orchestrator automation framework.
Serve as the initialization point for package-level configuration, utility exposure, scriptlet auto-discovery, and dependency management.

Context in Framework:
Ensures Python treats directories (e.g., orchestrator/, scriptlets/python/core/) as importable packages.
Allows for controlled exports, auto-registration, versioning, and global setup for each package/subpackage.

Description
__init__.py files serve multiple foundational roles throughout the orchestrator workspace:

Package Declaration:
Any directory containing an __init__.py is considered a Python package, enabling import statements for modules and submodules within it.

Module Path Resolution:
Facilitates relative imports and maintains namespace hierarchy, vital for scriptlet reuse and modular expansion (from orchestrator.context import Context).

Package-level Initialization:
Can include code that runs on package import: registration, environment checks, global constants, extended logging setup, or plugin/entry-point discovery.

Selective Export / API Exposure:
Can define __all__ to restrict or document public API surface for the package, aiding discoverability and maintainability.

Dependencies & Requirements
Python:
Python ≥3.6 (typical for orchestrator compatibility and type annotations).

Standard Library:

os, sys (optional, for dynamic imports or compatibility)

importlib (for plugin or scriptlet discovery)

Any framework-wide constants or utility modules

Third-party Packages:

None required for empty/init-only files; optional for extended features (see Recommendations).

Applications, Integrations, and Usage
Package Recognition:
Without __init__.py, neither the orchestrator nor packages like scriptlets/ are importable; interactive scripts and runner.py steps cannot reference modules by their qualified name.

python
# Correct with __init__.py in place:
from orchestrator.context import Context
from scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_row_updater import run as updater_run
Exposing Common Utilities:
A non-empty __init__.py at scriptlets/python/core/ might provide convenience imports for all core step helpers:

python
# scriptlets/python/core/__init__.py
from .ctx_cache import run as ctx_cache_run
from .ctx_logger import run as ctx_logger_run
# Client code:
from scriptlets.python.core import ctx_logger_run
Dynamic Scriptlet Listing (Auto-discovery):
Advanced: Support commands to list all available scriptlets for dynamic CLI or documentation generation.

python
# Inside __init__.py:
import pkgutil
__all__ = [name for _, name, _ in pkgutil.iter_modules(__path__)]
Usage (auto-list all steps via API or CLI):

python
from scriptlets.python.steps import __all__ as all_steps
for step in all_steps:
    print(step)
Versioning and Metadata Exposure:
Central location for workspace-wide version or author info.

python
# orchestrator/__init__.py
__version__ = "1.0.0"
__author__ = "Your Name"
Accessible from any part of the package.

Side Effects/Global Setup (Cautious Use):
Set up loggers, config objects, or execution hooks affecting all package modules.

python
# Cautiously! Only if global state/setup is required:
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
Limitations
No Functional Content by Default:
An empty __init__.py solely enables package import.
Any logic should be intentionally minimal and explicit.

Scope Creep:
Avoid placing business logic or step definitions in __init__.py (except for controlled factory/registry exposure).

Circular Import Risk:
Imports in __init__.py must avoid cyclical dependencies, especially in large or nested packages.

Performance Overhead:
Heavy computation or imports inside __init__.py may incur unnecessary overhead every time the package is imported.

Examples
1. Minimal (empty, default):
python
# __init__.py
# (empty file—declares a package)
2. Explicitly Exporting API:
python
# __init__.py for scriptlets/python/core
from .ctx_logger import run as ctx_logger_run
from .ctx_cache import run as ctx_cache_run

__all__ = ["ctx_logger_run", "ctx_cache_run"]
3. Metadata and Auto-discovery:
python
# __init__.py at orchestrator level
__version__ = "1.2.3"
__author__ = "Project Maintainer"
__description__ = "Automation Orchestrator Framework: shared context for test and analysis recipes."

# List all top-level submodules dynamically
import pkgutil
__all__ = [name for _, name, _ in pkgutil.iter_modules(__path__)]
4. Registering All Scriptlets for CLI or Docs:
python
# For 'scriptlets.python.steps'
import importlib
import pkgutil

# Registry to auto-discover all run() functions
step_registry = {}
for loader, module_name, is_pkg in pkgutil.iter_modules(__path__):
    if not is_pkg:
        mod = importlib.import_module(f"{__name__}.{module_name}")
        if hasattr(mod, "run"):
            step_registry[module_name] = mod.run
Now, from code or CLI:

python
from scriptlets.python.steps import step_registry
print("All available atomic step functions:", list(step_registry.keys()))
Recommendations & Tips for Expansion
1. Auto-Discovery of Scriptlets
Implement a registry or discovery system (see above) in __init__.py for step, app, and core utility modules.

Use this for:

CLI listing (python -m scriptlets list)

Doc generation

Step verification during recipe parsing.

2. Expose Version, Author, and Metadata
Maintain __version__, __author__, and __description__ at all major package layers for traceability.

3. Scoped Logging/Configuration
If global logging or settings are needed for debugging, initialize them here—document in comments to preserve clarity.

4. API Surface Control
Define __all__ to provide "what's public," easing maintenance of backward compatibility and discoverability.

5. Test and Doc Integration
Enable test harnesses or documentation tools to enumerate all modules/steps for coverage and doc auto-generation.

6. Help/Reflection Utilities
Provide methods for reflective help: automatic docstring extraction, step parameter listing, etc.

python
def list_scriptlets():
    return [name for name in __all__]
7. Plugin/Entry Point Framework
For extensibility, allow registering new scriptlets by detection or explicit API (e.g., via setuptools entry points or plugin folders).

8. Dependency Validation
Optionally, have __init__.py validate package or executable dependencies (like Dash, psutil, etc.) at import and warn the user.

Conclusion
__init__.py is essential for:

Enabling modular, reusable, and auto-discoverable scriptlet-based automation.

Enforcing package structure best practices and importability.

Providing a place for lightweight global setup, API curation, and future extensibility—while keeping business logic elsewhere.

For the orchestrator workspace, keep __init__.py minimal unless explicitly enhancing discoverability, registration, or metadata as recommended above.

Documentation: demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml
(Located at orchestrator/recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml)

Objective
The demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml recipe orchestrates a demo pipeline illustrating the integration and automation power of the orchestrator framework.
Primary Goal:

Demonstrate how to launch a live Dash dashboard app inside a background GNU screen session, while dynamically sharing and updating live time-series data via in-memory shared context (ctx) across Python and shell scriptlets.

Description
This recipe automates an end-to-end workflow comprising:

Setting up a managed background terminal (screen) session for long-running and loggable dashboard tasks.

Launching a Dash app in the screen session.

Initializing an in-memory timeseries for data collection (ctx["new_row"]).

Continuously updating this shared context (ctx) from a background thread.

Monitoring the context via an interactive web dashboard, live-updating as the data changes.

Key demonstration points:

Orchestrator’s capability to chain shell and Python scriptlets.

JSON-serializable, in-memory ctx sharing for reliable data exchange between orchestrator steps.

Background/parallel data generation and live visualization.

Step dependencies, structured logging, and debug mode for robust development.

Step-by-Step Applications & Integrations
The steps as authored:

1. create_screen_with_log
Type: shell

Script: scriptlets/shell/screen_script.sh

Args: -r test_screen

Description: Sets up (creates) a persistent GNU screen session named "test_screen" with logging enabled, which will later be used to run the Dash app.

Integration: Logs for the screen session are stored under Logs/.

2. check_and_attach_screen
Type: shell

Script: scriptlets/shell/screen_script.sh

Args: -l

Description: Lists all running screen sessions to ensure "test_screen" exists and can be attached to. This stdout can be parsed in downstream steps.

3. launch_dash_in_screen
Type: shell

Script: scriptlets/shell/screen_script.sh

Args: -s test_screen "python scriptlets/python/apps/hello_dash.py --port 8050 --ctx_key new_row"

Description: Sends a command to the running GNU screen to start the Dash server within that session, using the specified port and context key.

4. start_shared_ctx
Type: python

Module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_init

Function: run

Params: {"keys": ["new_row"]}

Description: Initializes a key new_row in the orchestrator's shared in-memory ctx. This context is used by both the data generator and the Dash app for inter-process communication.

5. update_ctx_background
Type: python

Module: scriptlets.python.steps.ctx_row_updater

Function: run

Params: {"key": "new_row", "n": 3, "interval_sec": 1}

Description: Spawns a Python background thread to continuously append new time-stamped rows (with three random float columns) to ctx["new_row"] every second; simulates streaming sensor data.

Integration: Updating occurs in-memory and is instantly available for any other concurrent Python or Dash process as well as for export by further scriptlets.

6. monitor_and_plot
Type: python

Module: scriptlets.python.apps.hello_dash

Function: run

Params: {"port": 8050, "ctx_key": "new_row"}

Description: Launches (or re-attaches to) the Dash dashboard that live-plots any data placed in ctx["new_row"]. The app detects new data as ctx is appended and updates the UI.

Dependencies
Python: 3.8+ (required for orchestrator runner, Dash, scriptlets, etc.)

Dash Stack:

dash (web server and UI)

plotly

dash-bootstrap-components (if theming/extending the dashboard)

Shell Tools:

bash

GNU screen (must be installed in PATH)

Python Packages:

pyyaml, psutil, shutil, argparse, threading, datetime, random, etc. (all listed in requirements.txt)

Orchestrator Core:

Files and modules: context.py, runner.py

All scriptlets referenced are designed to be independently runnable CLI programs as well as orchestrator steps.

Limitations
Screen Session: GNU screen must be available, and user must have permissions to create/manage sessions.

Dash App: Single port and ctx_key are hardcoded here; simultaneous runs with same port may cause a conflict.

Data Size: The in-memory ctx is best for moderate/typical dashboard demo data, not large-scale production streams.

Parallel Background Steps: While background threads are supported, only JSON-serializable types should be placed in ctx to avoid serialization issues.

Recipe Portability: This is a demo; production pipelines should further modularize error handling and custom success criteria.

Session Lifecycle: The Dash server is launched in background via the screen, so orchestrator will not terminate it after step 6; user must manually manage screen session lifecycle if required.

Usage
CLI (Runner):
text
# From orchestrator root (ensure all requirements are installed)
python runner.py --recipe recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml

# Optional: Debug mode (track ctx and verbose logs)
touch runner.debug
python runner.py --recipe recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml

# Run only a subset of steps
python runner.py --recipe recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml --only start_shared_ctx update_ctx_background

# Skip a step
python runner.py --recipe recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml --skip monitor_and_plot
Inspecting Outputs:
Logs: orchestrator/Logs/ will contain logs for each step, plus session logs and error logs.

Assets: A directed graph (if digraph update implemented in runner.py) will be at orchestrator/Assets/graph.png.

Live Dashboard:

Open browser at http://localhost:8050 to see the real-time dashboard generated by Dash.

Screen Sessions:

Attach via screen -r test_screen in terminal, or list via screen -ls.

Terminate session using scriptlets/shell/screen_script.sh -k test_screen.

Example: Step-by-Step Run
text
# Minimal custom step to print hello
- idx: 0
  name: print_hello
  type: shell
  cmd: echo
  args: ["Hello, Automation!"]

# Full recipe run
python runner.py --recipe recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml

# Debug mode for full ctx trace
touch orchestrator/runner.debug
python runner.py --recipe recipes/demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml
cat orchestrator/Logs/ctx_debug.log
Expansion Recommendations & Enhancement Suggestions
To further extend and enhance demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml (framework-compliant):

Add Export/Import Steps

Use scriptlets such as ctx_to_csv.py or file_to_ctx.py to persist generated data for post-run audits or resume.

Example step:

text
- idx: 7
  name: export_new_row_to_csv
  type: python
  module: scriptlets.python.core.ctx_to_csv
  function: run
  params:
    key: "new_row"
    out: "Data/new_row.csv"
  depends_on: [monitor_and_plot]
Integrate Notification Steps

Use core notification scriptlets (ctx_notify.py or ctx_notify_advanced.py) to trigger Slack/email/SMS on pipeline completion or failure.

Live Data Processing/Validation

Add steps to analyze recent values in new_row, summarize stats (ctx_stats.py), or validate columns (ctx_validate.py).

Dash App Extension

Evolve your dashboard with additional callbacks, DataTable views, Bootstrap styling, or support for multiple ctx keys/series.

Parallel Data Sources

Add steps with background: true to simultaneously generate multiple live ctx data streams, merge them (ctx_merge.py), or visualize in separate tabs or graphs.

Step Auditing/Profiling

Add core scriptlets like ctx_step_audit.py, ctx_profiler.py, or custom logger steps to the recipe for rich timing/resource diagnostics.

Automated Cleanup

Add a terminal step using tools/clean_pristine.sh to reset all outputs before or after your demo pipeline runs.

Error Handling and Rollback

Use ctx_rollback.py, ctx_step_rollback_point.py, or checkpointing utilities to enable robust error recovery.

Unit Test Recipes

For every new step or major recipe extension, add tests under tests/ as seen in tests/test_ctx_row_updater.py and tests/test_ctx_init.py.

Documentation and Discoverability

Comment every step, describe intended results, reference the scriptlet CLI equivalent, and continually update versioned schema for discoverability and reusability.

Best Practices & Tips
Scriptlet Independence:
Each scriptlet invoked (in both Python and Shell) must be independently runnable from CLI for debug and development.

Thorough Docstrings:
Scriptlets and recipes should always provide top-of-file docstrings covering usage, limitation, and argument schema.

Traceability:
Always ensure all ctx changes are loggable and traceable through orchestrator debug mode for reproducibility.

Small and Composable Steps:
Break large operations into reusable scriptlets or small recipe steps; never make monolithic pipeline code.

Serializable Data:
Only store JSON-serializable objects/values in shared ctx.

Avoid Surprises:
Honor step order with explicit depends_on lists. Avoid race conditions by expressing all background or parallel needs declaratively in the recipe.

For more complex integrations (longer pipelines, multiple dashboards, real-time ML/AI, streaming, notifications), gradually expand demo_screen_dash_ctx.yaml using the above suggestions in modular, tightly-commented steps—never violating backward compatibility or ctx serialization constraints.
