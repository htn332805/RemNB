Investing
AFTER READING THIS CHAPTER YOU
WILL BE ABLE TO:
• Calculate important risk and return
measures for financial assets, using
the formulation appropriate for the
task.

return, including geometric mean,
cumulative wealth index, inflation-
adjusted return, and currency-
adjusted return.
• Understand clearly historical secu-
rity performance, an important step
in estimating future risk and return.
142 Chapter 6 The Risk and Return from Investing
For convenience, TR is conventionally labeled simply as return (R). We follow
this convention throughout the rest of this text. Therefore, when you see return
(R), just remember that it incorporates both components of return. Furthermore,
returns are almost always reported as annual values and are reported in percent.
When you are calculating returns, you may use the decimal form; however, when
reporting the final number, make sure to convert it to a percent. What would you
think of the wisdom of a person that told you they just obtained a mortgage at 0.004
per month? Clearly, the language of the financial markets dictates we talk in terms
of annual percent returns, the above annual rate is 4.8 percent. Any deviation from
this convention should be clearly highlighted and explained.
The periodic cash flows from a bond consist of the interest payments received,
and for a stock, the dividends received. For some assets, such as a T-bill or a
nondividend-paying stock, there is only a price change. Exhibit 6.1 illustrates the
calculation of TR, or from now on R, for a bond and a common stock. Although one
year is often used for convenience, the return calculation can be applied to periods
of any length.

Calculating returns for the S&P 500 index Table 6.1 shows the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) for the years 1926 through 2018 (a total of 93 years
because the data start on January 1, 1926). Included in the table are end-of-year val-
ues for the index, from which capital gains and losses can be computed, and divi-
dends, which constitute the income component.
Conclusions about total return In summary, the total return concept, identified
as return (R), is valuable as a measure of return because it is all-inclusive.
• Return (R) is the basic measure of the income earned by investors on any
financial asset for any specified period of time. It is generally stated on a per-
centage basis.

The returns shown in Table 6.1 are calculated as shown

and Marc Simpson, “What Difference Do Dividends Make,” Financial Analysts Journal, 72, (November/
December 2016): 28–40.
Concepts in Action
What Difference Do Dividends Make?
There are some investors that target dividend
paying stocks, whereas others target firms that
pay no dividend. The preference for a specific
dividend policy is often attributed to an investor’s
tax situation, appetite for risk, or desire for periodic
cash inflows. The effect that an investor’s dividend
strategy has on overall portfolio performance is
often debated Is overall portfolio performance
better if the investor obtains a large portion of
portfolio return from dividends or is it better to rely
on capital gains for portfolio return?
An article by Conover, Jensen, and Simpson
addressed this issue directly.4 The following table
is adapted from their Table 2 Annual Portfolio
Performance Across Dividend Level: July 1963–
December 2014,
Dividend Yield Portfolio
Investment Performance No Dividend Low Dividend High Dividend Extreme Dividend
Mean Return 9.58% 9.99% 11.31% 10.69%
Standard Deviation of Return 24.37% 16.44% 13.90% 17.15%
The “Extreme Dividend“ portfolio includes the
5% of dividend paying firms with the highest
dividend yield. These firms are separated from the
other dividend payers as recognition that firms
with very high dividend yields are often finan-
cially distressed. An extreme dividend yield for
a firm typically results from the firm’s stock price
declining considerably, whereas the dividend
continues to be paid. Generally, investors expect
that the dividend for these firms will be slashed or
omitted in the next few quarters.
The other dividend paying firms are sepa-
rated roughly equally into the “Low Dividend”
and “High Dividend” portfolio. These portfo-
lios include the firms that have established a
dividend payment policy at a relatively low or
high level.
Interestingly, the evidence in the table indi-
cates that the portfolio of firms paying no
dividend earned the lowest total return, yet
subjected investors to the greatest risk. Clearly,
this portfolio provided investors with a suboptimal
investment result over the period. In contrast, the
“High Dividend” portfolio reported the highest
return and subjected investors to the least risk. The
“High Dividend” portfolio was superior to the other
portfolios and was especially dominant over the
“No Dividend” portfolio’s performance.
The authors went on to evaluate the benefits of
dividend policy across investment strategy. They
found that investors targeting relatively small firms
with strong growth prospects gained the greatest
benefit by shifting their strategy to include firms
paying relatively high dividends. In contrast, for

Cumulative Wealth Index
The rate of change in an asset’s price and percentage rates of return have multiple
uses. Nevertheless, we all understand dollar amounts! Therefore, it is often desir-
able to measure how one’s wealth changes over time. In other words, we measure
the cumulative effect of returns compounding over time given some stated initial
investment, which is frequently shown as $1 for convenience. Note that having calcu-
lated ending wealth (cumulative wealth) over some time period on the basis of a $1
initial investment, it is simple enough to multiply by an investor’s actual beginning
amount invested, such as $10,000.
The cumulative wealth index, CWIn, is computed as
CWI WIn nR R R0 1 21 1 1 (6-3)
CWI the cumulative wealth index as of the end of periodn n
WI the beginning index value; typically $ is used but0 1 any amount can be used

Cumulative wealth is always stated in dollars and represents the effects of com-
pounding returns over some period of time, given any initial investment.

over time, given an initial
wealth and a series of
returns on some asset
investors targeting relatively large companies with
limited growth prospects, the dividend choice did
not significantly affect portfolio performance; how-
ever, it still significantly reduced risk.
Overall, the authors conclude that adding
dividend paying stocks to one’s portfolio has
offered substantial benefits no matter what the
investor’s strategy. In all cases, the addition of
dividends significantly reduced portfolio risk.
Furthermore, for investors targeting firms of below
average size with strong growth prospects, target-
ing dividend payers provided a double benefit as
it increased portfolio return significantly while also
significantly cutting risk.
Let’s calculate cumulative wealth per $1 invested for the
1990s, one of the greatest decades in the 20th century
to own common stocks. This will provide you with a perspective on common
stock returns at their best. Using the S&P returns in Table 6.1 and converting
them to return relatives, the cumulative wealth index for the decade of the
1990s (the 10-year period 1990–1999) would be
CWI90 99 1 00 0 9686 1 30 1 0743 1 0994 1 0129 1 3711. . . . . . . 1 2268 1 331

Thus, $1 invested at the beginning of 1990 would have been worth $5.23
by the end of 1999. Obviously, any beginning wealth value can be used to
calculate cumulative wealth. For example, $10,000 invested under the same
conditions would have been worth $52,300 at the end of 1999, and $37,500
invested under the same conditions would have been worth $196,125

percent for an investor transacting only in euros. However, the value of the dollar fell
during this period, and when the shares of Air France were sold, the euro proceeds
bought back more dollars. The dollar value of one share had risen to $1.14(9.282)
= $10.581. During the two-year period, Air France stock paid no dividend. The total
return for the two-year period (in dollar terms) was: (10.581/5.433) − 1 = 94.75 per-
cent. The annual return, in dollar terms, was: (10.581/5.433)0.5 −1 = 39.55 percent.
To calculate directly the return to a U.S. investor from an investment in a foreign
country, we can use Equation 6-4. The return earned on the foreign asset in terms
of foreign currency ( )RFA is compounded by the change in the foreign currency
value. The foreign currency is stated in domestic terms—that is, the amount of
domestic currency necessary to purchase one unit of the foreign currency:

The dollar and investors How much difference can currency adjustments make
to investors? They can make a substantial difference for selected periods of time.
In a year of phenomenal returns, the Brazilian market
was up about 150 percent, but the currency adjustment
for U.S. investors was negative 83 percent, leaving a U.S. dollar return for the
year of approximately 67 percent instead of 150 percent. On the other hand,
the Japanese market enjoyed a 47 percent return, and the currency adjustment
was positive, 15 percent, resulting in a U.S. dollar return of approximately 62
percent for the year.

Checking Your Understanding
1. The Cumulative Wealth Index can be calculated for nominal stock returns,
but it cannot show the impact of inflation. Agree or disagree, and explain
your reasoning.
2. What does it mean to say that when you buy a foreign asset, you are selling
the dollar?
3. Is it correct to say that in recent years antidollar bets by U.S. investors paid off?
Summary Statistics for Returns
Return and cumulative wealth index are useful measures of performance for a spec-
ified time period. Also needed for investment analysis are statistics to describe a
series of returns. For example, investing in a particular stock for 10 years or a differ-
ent stock in each of 10 years could result in 10 returns, which need to be described by
summary statistics. Two such measures used with returns data are described below.
Arithmetic Mean
The best known statistic to most people is the arithmetic mean. Therefore, when
someone refers to the mean or average return, they usually are referring to the arith-
metic mean unless otherwise specified. The arithmetic mean, customarily desig-
nated by the symbol X , of a set of values is calculated as:
X X
n
(6-5)
or the sum of the values being considered divided by the total number of values n.
Geometric Mean
The arithmetic mean return is an appropriate measure of the central tendency of a
return distribution for a particular time period, such as 10 years. However, when an
ending value is the result of compounding over time, the geometric mean is needed
to describe accurately the “true” average return over multiple periods.
The geometric mean is defined as the nth root of the product resulting from
multiplying a series of return relatives together, as in Equation 6-6:
RG 1 1 1 11 2
1
R R Rn
n/
(6-6)
where R is a series of returns in decimal form and RG is the geometric mean return.
Note that adding 1.0 to each return produces a return relative. Return relatives are
used in calculating geometric mean returns.5
The geometric mean return measures compound growth over time. It is important
to note that the geometric mean assumes that all cash flows are reinvested in the asset

time
5 An alternative method of calculating the geometric mean is to find the log of each return relative, sum
them, divide by n, and take the antilog.

and that those reinvested funds earn the subsequent return earned on that asset. It
reflects the steady growth rate of invested funds over some past period—that is, the
uniform rate at which money actually grew per period, taking into account all gains
and losses.
• Think of the annual geometric mean as the equal annual return that
makes a beginning amount of money grow to a particular ending amount
of money.
For example, we saw in Example 6.4 that $1 invested in the S&P 500 on January 1,
1990, would have grown to $5.23 by December 31, 1999 (10 years). This is a result
of the money compounding at the annual rate of 18 percent. At the end of year 1,
the $1 would grow to $1.18; at the end of year 2, the $1.18 would grow to $1.39; at
the end of year 3, the $1.39 would grow to $1.64, and so on, until at the end of year

10 the original $1 is worth $5.23. Notice that this geometric average return is lower
than the arithmetic average return of 18.76 percent.
• The geometric mean is always less than the arithmetic mean unless the values
being considered are identical, which is an unlikely event. The spread between
the two depends on the dispersion of the distribution: the greater the dispersion
(higher the standard deviation), the greater the spread between the two means.
Arithmetic Mean Versus Geometric Mean
When should we use the arithmetic mean and when should we use the geometric
mean to describe the returns from financial assets? The answer depends on the
investor’s objective:
• The arithmetic mean is a better measure of average (typical) performance
over single periods. It is the better measure for investors that rebalance their
portfolios to begin each period with a fixed size investment.
• The geometric mean is a better measure of the change in wealth over the past
(multiple periods). It is typically used by investors to measure the realized
compound rate of return at which money grew over a specified period of time.
It is the better measure for investors that follow a buy-and-hold strategy.
Over multiple periods, the geometric mean shows the true average compound
rate of growth that actually occurred—that is, the annual average rate at which an
invested dollar grew, taking into account the gains and losses over time.
Consider the return data for the S&P Index for the years 1990–1999 as described
earlier. Our best representation of any one year’s performance would be the arith-
metic mean of 18.76 percent. It was necessary to average this rate of return, given the
variability in the yearly numbers, in order to realize an annual compound growth
rate of 18 percent after the fact.
Concepts in Action
Using the Geometric Mean to Measure
Market Performance
The geometric mean for the S&P 500 for the 20th
century was 10.35 percent. Thus, $1 invested in this
index compounded at an average rate of 10.35
percent every year during the period 1900–1999.
What about the first decade of the 21st century
(defined as 2000–2009)? The S&P 500 suffered losses
for the first three years of the decade, followed by
positive returns during 2003–2007. The year 2008 was
a disaster, but 2009 showed a very large return. The
geometric mean for this decade is calculated as
Return Relatives for the S&P 500 Index:
2000 0.910 2004 1.107 2008 0.635
2001 0.881 2005 1.048 2009 1.259
2002 0.780 2006 1.156
2003 1.284 2007 1.055
[(0.910)(0.881)(0.780)(1.284)(1.107)(1.048)(1.156)
(1.055)(0.635)(1.259)] 1/10 −1.0
= [0.9086] 1/10 − 1.0
= 0.9905 − 1.0
= −0.0095 or −0.95%
This indicates that $1 invested in the S&P 500
at the beginning of 2000 grew at an average
annual rate of approximately −1 percent a year
for the first 10 years of the 21st century. The market,
as measured by the S&P 500 got a very bad start
for the first three years of the decade, and it is
quite difficult to overcome such a bad start. The
severely negative performance in 2008 sealed the
fate for this decade. This poor performance has
led some to name this period the “Lost Decade”
for common stocks. In fact, this decade was the
worst-performing decade for stocks in the history
of reliable stock market data.
Summary Statistics for Returns 153
Inflation-Adjusted Returns
All returns discussed above are nominal returns, based on dollar amounts that do
not take inflation into account. Typically, the returns we see daily on the news, being
paid by financial institutions, or quoted to us by lenders, are nominal rates of return.
To assess our actual gain, we need to consider the purchasing power of the dol-
lars involved in investing. To capture this dimension, we analyze real returns, or
inflation-adjusted returns. When nominal returns are adjusted for inflation, the
result is in constant purchasing power terms.
Why is this important to you? What really matters is the purchasing power that
your dollars have. It is not simply a case of how many dollars you have but what those
dollars will buy. 6
Since 1871, the starting point for reliable data on stocks, the United States has
had a few periods of deflation, but on average the United States has experienced
mild inflation over a long period of time. Therefore, on average, the purchasing
power of the dollar has declined over the long run. We typically define the rate of
inflation as the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).7
Nominal Return Return

no adjustment to remove

As an illustration of how the arithmetic mean can be
misleading, consider the data in Table 6.4, which show
the movements in price for two stocks over two successive holding periods.
Both stocks have a beginning price of $10. Stock A rises to $20 in period 1
and then declines to $10 in period 2. Stock B falls to $8 in period 1 and then
rises 50 percent to $12 in period 2. For stock A, the indicated annual average
arithmetic rate of change in price is 25 percent [(100% − 50%)/2]. This is
clearly not sensible because the price of stock A at the end of period 2 is
$10, the same as the beginning price. The geometric mean calculation gives
the correct annual average rate of change in price of 0 percent per year. For
stock B, the arithmetic average of the annual percentage changes in price is
15 percent. However, if the price actually increased 15 percent each period,
the ending price in period 2 would be $10(1.15)(1.15) = $13.23. We know that
this is not correct because the price at the end of period 2 is $12. The annual
geometric rate of return, 9.54 percent, produces the correct price at the end
of period 2: $10(1.0954)(1.0954) = $12.
154 Chapter 6 The Risk and Return from Investing
The consumer price index Based on the CPI, the compound annual rate of
inflation over the period 1926–2018 was approximately 2.92 percent. This means
that a basket of consumer goods purchased at the beginning of 1926 for $1 would
cost approximately $14.54 at year-end 2018. This is calculated as (1.0292) 93 because
there are 93 years from the beginning of 1926 through the end of 2018.
Relation between nominal return and real return The nominal return (R)
is related to the real return (Rr) and the expected inflation rate (Ir) as shown in
Equation 6-7:
R R I1 1 1r r (6-7)
This equation can be applied to both individual years and average returns.
Checking Your Understanding
4. Assume that you invest $1,000 in a stock. Your rate of return is 15 percent for
year 1, followed by a loss of 15 percent for year two. Did you break even by the
end of year 2? Would it matter if the sequence of returns was reversed?
5. The inflation rate has been very low in recent years. Why, then, should inves-
tors be concerned with inflation-adjusted returns?
Risk
It is not sensible to talk about investment returns without talking about risk because
investment decisions involve a trade-off between the two. Investors must constantly be
aware of the risk they are assuming and be prepared for the consequences of this risk.
• Return and risk are opposite sides of the same coin.
Suppose your father earned a salary of $35,000 in 1975,
and by 2019, his salary had increased to $135,000. How
much better off is he in terms of purchasing power? We can convert the
$35,000 in 1975 dollars into 2019 dollars. When we do this, we find that the
1975 salary is worth $163,753 in 2019 dollars. So in terms of purchasing power,
your father has suffered a significant loss over this long time period.
EXAMPLE 6.9
The return for the S&P 500 in 2018 was about −4.2
percent. The rate of inflation was about 2.4 percent.
Therefore, the real (inflation-adjusted) return for large U.S. common stocks
in 2018 was (0.958/1.024) − 1 = −0.064 or −6.4 percent.
EXAMPLE 6.10
Consider the period 1926–2018. The geometric mean for
the S&P 500 for the entire period was approximately 10
percent and for the CPI, 3.0 percent. Therefore, the real (inflation-adjusted)
geometric mean return for large common stocks for the period 1926–2018
was (1.10/1.03) − 1 = 0.068 or 6.8%.
EXAMPLE 6.11
158 Chapter 6 The Risk and Return from Investing
The standard deviation and variance are measures of the total risk or dispersion of
an asset or a portfolio. They capture total variability in the asset’s or portfolio’s return,
whatever the source of that variability. The two measures tend to be referenced inter-
changeably when discussing the concept of variability or risk; however, since standard
deviation is measured in the same units as the mean, standard deviation is used more
commonly than variance when performing investment analysis and calculations.
For a variable (X), the variance and standard deviation are calculated as:

In summary, the standard deviation of return measures the total risk of one secu-
rity or the total risk of a portfolio of securities. This ex post value is useful in evaluat-
ing the total risk for a particular historical period and in estimating the total risk
that is expected to prevail over some future period. The calculation of standard
deviation for the 10 annual returns from 2005 through 2014 for the S&P 500 is

variability of the return series. The linkage between the geometric mean and the
arithmetic mean is approximated by Equation 6-9:
1 1
2 2 2
R RG A (6-9)
where
R the geometric mean of a series of asset returns
R the ari
G
A tthmetic mean of a series of asset returns
the variance of2 the series of returns
• If we know the arithmetic mean and variance of a series of asset returns, we
can approximate the geometric mean for this series. As the variance of a series
increases, the superiority of the arithmetic mean relative to the geometric
mean also increases.
As indicated by Equation 6-9, the greater difference between the geometric and
arithmetic mean for the small-cap index can be attributed to the small-cap indexes’
greater volatility. Note that the volatility of the small-cap index is the largest of all
the return series and is substantially greater than even that of the large-cap index.
Table 6.6 shows that over this 93-year period, small-cap stocks earned a return that
was somewhat higher than that of large-cap stocks. In addition, both of the equity
indexes recorded minimum and maximum values that were much larger when com-
pared to the other indexes. Interestingly, for the equity indexes, the smallest and
largest values both occurred in the 1930s, which is consistent with the phenomenon
that extreme swings in stock returns tend to appear in close proximity. For example,
the extreme negative returns for the S&P 500 for 2002 (−21.97 percent) and 2008
(−36.55 percent) were followed the next year with returns of 28.36 percent and
25.94 percent, respectively.
Corporate and Treasury bonds have geometric mean returns that are roughly
50 to 60 percent of the returns reported for the equity indexes. The bond indexes,
however, have standard deviations that are much lower than those reported for
the equity indexes. These observations support the well-recognized positive rela-
tion that exists between risk and long-term security returns. Interestingly, relative
to long-term corporate bonds, long-term government bonds have greater risk (9.8
percent versus 8.4 percent), but lower returns (5.5 percent versus 5.9 percent).
This would seem to contradict the positive long-term risk-return trade-off rule. This
observation, however, is not a violation of the rule as it can be attributed to govern-
ment bonds offering a unique advantage relative to corporate bonds, exemption
from state and local income taxes.10
Finally, as expected, T-bills have the smallest returns of any of the major assets
shown in Table 6.6, 3.3 percent, as well as by far the smallest standard deviation (3.1
percent).
T-bill investors never experienced a significant negative return over the entire
93-year period as their lowest return was only −0.02 percent.
10 The reason for the variability in the returns for T-bonds and T-bills, which have no practical risk of
default, is that the data is represented by a series of annual returns, where negative numbers are possible.
Thus, a new 10-year T-bond purchased at $1,000 on January 1 could decline to, say, $900 by December
31, resulting in a negative return for that year. For the full 10-year period, its return will, of course, be
positive since it will be redeemed for $1,000.

Cumulative Wealth Indexes
Table 6.7 shows cumulative wealth values for the major asset classes based on a $100
investment at the beginning of 1926. Many people find the value differences across
the asset classes to be astounding. For example, $100 placed in a bond fund would
have cumulated to somewhere between $10,000 and $21,000 depending on bond
type, which seems like a great result. It is a great result, until we consider the alterna-
tives. The same $100 invested in large-cap stocks would have cumulated to $707,163.
Over the 93 years, large-cap stocks returned about twice what bonds returned;
however, the cumulative wealth difference is much larger than twice the difference;
it is about 35 times greater. Why? Remember that time value of money is an expo-
nential process. Compounding produces an exponential growth in money, not a
linear growth. How about that relatively small difference of 1.8 percent between
the return to small-cap and large-cap stocks? It produced a value difference of
$2,492,378 ($3,199,541 − $707,163). Now you can see why fund managers fight for
even a few extra basis points. A small return premium earned over an extended time
makes for a large difference in the final wealth accumulated and is the basis for a lot
better marketing material.11

EXAMPLE 6.12
11 When plotting cumulative wealth values across time, a logarithmic scale is typically used. A logarithmic
scale greatly facilitates comparisons of different series across time because the same vertical distance rep-
resents the same percentage change in a particular series return. The logarithmic scale allows the user to
concentrate on rates of return and ignore the dollar amounts involved.

The cumulative wealth values reported in Table 6.7 are derived by raising
(1 + geometric mean return from Table 6.6) to the 93rd power; there are 93 years in
the period. The geometric mean reflects the return from following a buy-and-hold
strategy, whereas the arithmetic mean reflects the return from a rebalancing strat-
egy, i.e., keeping the amount invested at the beginning of each period constant.12
We all appreciate dollar totals, and the larger the final wealth accumulated over
some period of time, the better. If we understand how cumulative wealth is gener-
ated, we have a better chance of enhancing that wealth. For stocks, the cumulative
wealth index can be decomposed into the two components of return—the dividend
component and the price change component.
For S&P 500 stocks, about 40 percent of the total return over time can be attrib-
uted to dividends. When dividend yields are low, as they have been recently, inves-
tors have to earn more from the price change component of cumulative wealth or
their cumulative wealth will grow at a slower pace going forward.
Financial Asset Return Superiority
Table 6.7 reports data regarding the return superiority of each of the financial assets
over alternative holding periods. As expected, small-cap stocks, which have the greatest
risk, produced superior returns in the most cases. Of the total of 93 years, small-cap
stocks were superior in 41 years, large-cap stocks in 17 years, bonds of various types in 22
years, T-bills in 6 years, and inflation was the highest in 7 years. As the holding period is
extended, the dominance of equities and especially small-cap equities expands. There
has only been one 20-year period in the history of the organized U.S. financial markets
when bonds have produced superior returns to equities. That period ended with the
2008 financial crisis and included two major market meltdowns, 2000–2002 and 2008.
If you seek guidance from a financial advisor regarding saving for your retire-
ment in 30 years, would it surprise you when the advisor recommends the majority
of your portfolio be allocated to equities? I hope not. There is no 30-year period in
the history of the U.S financial markets where equity returns were less than bond
returns.

Compounding and Discounting
Of course, the single most striking feature of Table 6.7 is the tremendous differ-
ence in ending wealth between stocks and bonds. This difference reflects the impact
of compounding different mean returns over long periods, which produces almost
unbelievable results. The use of compounding points out the importance of this
concept and of its complement, discounting. Both are important in investment
analysis and are used often. Compounding involves deriving future values that result
from compound interest—earning interest on interest. As we saw, the calculation
of wealth indexes involves compounding at the geometric mean return over some
historical period.
Present value (discounting) is the value today of a dollar to be received in the
future. Future dollars are not comparable to present dollars, because of the time
value of money. In order to be comparable, they must be discounted back to the
present. Present value concepts are used extensively in Chapters 10 and 17, and in
other chapters as needed.
Summary
• Risk and return go together in investments; indeed, these two parameters are
the underlying basis of investments. Everything an investor does, or is con-
cerned with, is tied directly or indirectly to risk and return.
• The term return can be used in different ways. It is important to distinguish
between realized (ex post, or historical) return and expected (ex ante, or
anticipated) return.
• The two components of return are yield and price change (capital gain or loss).
• The total return is a percentage return concept that can be used to correctly
measure the return for any security.
• The return relative, which adds 1.0 to the return, is used when calculating the
geometric mean of a series of returns.
• The cumulative wealth index is used to measure cumulative wealth over time
given some initial starting wealth—typically, $1—and a series of returns.
• The beginning and ending values of the foreign currency can be used to con-
vert the return on a foreign investment into a domestic return.
• The geometric mean measures the compound rate of return over time,
whereas the arithmetic mean is simply the average return for a series and is
used to measure the typical performance for a single period.
• Inflation-adjusted returns can be calculated by dividing (1 + the nominal
return) by (1 + the inflation rate), where inflation is commonly derived as the
percent change in the CPI.
• Risk and expected return should always be considered together. An investor
cannot reasonably expect to earn larger returns without assuming greater risks.
• The primary components of risk have traditionally been categorized into
interest rate, market, inflation, business, financial, and liquidity risks. Inves-
tors must also consider exchange rate risk and country risk.
• Historical returns can be described in terms of a frequency distribution and
their variability as measured by standard deviation or variance.
Questions 165
• The standard deviation provides useful information about the distribution
of returns and aids investors in assessing the possible outcomes of an invest-
ment.
• Common stocks over the period 1926–2018 had an annualized geometric
mean return of 10.0 percent, compared to 5.5 percent for long-term Treasury
bonds.
• Over the period 1926–2018, common stock returns had a standard deviation
of approximately 19.8 percent, about twice that of long-term government
bonds and about six times that of Treasury bills.
