Explain why ethics is an important topic in the study of corporate finance.
In July of 2020, Uber Technologies, Inc. (Uber) entered into an agreement for a $2.65 billion deal to acquire the delivery service Postmates. Why did Uber’s management decide to purchase Postmates, and how did the Uber and Postmates management teams agree on the $2.65 billion price tag?

In a press release related to the deal, Postmates co-founder and CEO Bastian Lehmann stated that “Over the past eight years we have been focused on a single mission: enable anyone to have anything delivered to them on-demand. Joining forces with Uber will continue that mission as we continue to build Postmates while creating an even stronger platform that brings this mission to life for our customers.” In the same press release, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi noted that “Uber and Postmates have long shared a belief that platforms like ours can power much more than just food delivery—they can be a hugely important part of local commerce and communities, all the more important during crises like COVID-19.”

Analysts noted the potential for the combination to create value for the shareholders of Uber. Postmates services are complementary to those of Uber Eats, with differentiated geographic coverage and customer demographics. More notably, Postmates is a pioneer of “delivery-as-a-service,” which would complement Uber’s growing efforts in the delivery of groceries, essentials, and other goods. Of course, none of the potential benefits are sure to be realized in the future. For example, Uber Eats faces stiff competition in its food delivery services from a number of competitors, including Grubhub, which itself was acquired in April of 2020 for $7.3 billion by the European service Just Eat Takeaway.

The managers of companies like Uber and Postmates use many of the concepts covered in this chapter and throughout this book to create the most value possible for their investors. Managers can create value by buying companies only when the expected benefit of doing so exceeds the cost of the acquisition. This involves managing the assets of the company as efficiently as possible, and financing companies with the least expensive combination of debt and equity. This chapter introduces you to the key decisions facing financial managers, and the remainder of the book fills in many of the details of how these decisions are made.

Chapter Preview
This book provides an introduction to corporate finance. In it we focus on the responsibilities of the financial manager, who oversees the accounting and treasury functions and sets the overall financial strategy for the firm. We pay special attention to the financial manager’s role as a decision maker. To that end, we emphasize the mastery of fundamental financial concepts and tools that are used to make sound financial decisions that create value for stockholders. These financial concepts and tools apply not only to business organizations but also to other venues, such as government entities, not-for-profit organizations, and sometimes even our own personal finances.

We begin this chapter by discussing the three major types of decisions that a financial manager makes. We then describe common forms of business organization. After next discussing the major responsibilities of the financial manager, we explain why maximizing the value of the firm’s stock is an appropriate goal for a financial manager. We go on to describe the conflicts of interest that can arise between stockholders and managers and the mechanisms that help align the interests of these two groups. Finally, we discuss the importance of ethical conduct in business.

1.1 The Role of the Financial Manager
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Identify the key financial decisions facing the financial manager of any business.
The financial manager is responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of the firm’s owners, whether the firm is a start-up business with a single owner or a billion-dollar corporation owned by thousands of stockholders. The decisions made by the financial manager or owner should be one and the same. In most situations this means that the financial manager should make decisions that maximize the value of the owners’ stock. This helps maximize the owners’ wealth, which is the economic value of the assets the owner possesses. Our underlying assumption in this book is that most people who invest in businesses do so because they want to increase their wealth. In the following discussion, we describe the responsibilities of the financial manager in a new business in order to illustrate the types of decisions that such a manager makes.

wealth the economic value of the assets someone possesses

Stakeholders
Before we discuss the new business, you may want to look at Exhibit 1.1, which shows the cash flows between a firm and its owners (in a corporation, the stockholders) and various stakeholders. A stakeholder is someone other than an owner who has a claim on the cash flows of the firm. Stakeholders include managers, who want to be paid salaries and performance bonuses; other employees, who want to be paid wages; suppliers, who want to be paid for goods or services they provide; creditors, who want to be paid interest and principal; and the government, which wants the firm to pay taxes. Stakeholders may have interests that differ from those of the owners. When this is the case, they may exert pressure on management to make decisions that benefit them. We will return to these types of conflicts of interest later in the book. For now, though, we are primarily concerned with the overall flow of cash between the firm and its stockholders and stakeholders.

stakeholder anyone other than an owner (stockholder) with a claim on the cash flows of a firm, including employees, suppliers, creditors, and the government

EXHIBIT 1.1 Cash Flows Between the Firm and Its Stakeholders and Owners (Stockholders) A. Making business decisions is all about cash flows, because only cash can be used to pay bills and buy new assets. Cash initially flows into the firm as a result of the sale of goods or services. These cash inflows are used in a number of ways: to pay wages and salaries, to buy supplies, to repay creditors, and to pay taxes.
B. Any cash that is left over (residual cash flows) can be reinvested in the business or paid as dividends to stockholders or used to repurchase shares.


It’s All About Cash Flows
To produce its products or services, a firm needs to acquire a variety of assets. Most will be long-term assets, which are also known as productive assets. Productive assets can be tangible assets, such as equipment, machinery, or a manufacturing facility, or intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks, technical expertise, or other types of intellectual capital. Regardless of the type of asset, the firm tries to select assets that will generate the greatest cash flows for the firm’s owners. The decision-making process through which the firm purchases productive assets is called capital budgeting, and it is one of the most important decision processes in a firm.

productive assets the long-term tangible and intangible assets a firm uses to generate cash flows

Once the managers of a firm have selected the firm’s productive assets, they must raise money to pay for them. Financing decisions determine the ways in which firms obtain and manage long-term financing to acquire and support their productive assets. There are two basic sources of funds: debt and equity. Every firm has some equity because equity represents ownership in the firm. It consists of capital contributions by the owners plus cash flows that have been reinvested in the firm. In addition, most firms borrow from a bank or issue some type of long-term debt to finance productive assets.

After the productive assets have been purchased and the business is operating, the managers of the firm will try to produce products at the lowest possible cost while maintaining quality. This means buying raw materials at the lowest possible cost, holding production and labor costs down, keeping management and administrative costs to a minimum, and seeing that shipping and delivery costs are competitive. In addition, day-to-day finances must be managed so that the firm will have sufficient cash on hand to pay salaries, purchase supplies, maintain inventories, pay taxes, and cover the myriad of other expenses necessary to run a business. The management of current assets, such as money owed by customers who purchase on credit, inventory, and current liabilities, such as money owed to suppliers, is called working capital management.1

A firm generates cash flows by selling the goods and services it produces. A firm is successful when these cash inflows exceed the cash outflows needed to pay operating expenses, creditors, and taxes. After meeting these obligations, managers of the firm can distribute the remaining cash, called residual cash flows, to the owners as a cash dividend or by repurchasing some shares, or reinvest the cash in the business. The reinvestment of residual cash flows in the business to buy more productive assets is a very important concept. If these funds are invested wisely, they provide the foundation for the firm to grow and provide larger residual cash flows in the future for the owners. The reinvestment of cash flows (earnings) is the most fundamental way that businesses grow in size. Exhibit 1.1 illustrates how the revenue generated by productive assets ultimately becomes residual cash flows.

residual cash flows the cash remaining after a firm has paid operating expenses and what it owes creditors and in taxes; can be distributed to the owners as a cash dividend or by repurchasing some shares, or reinvested in the business

Building Intuition
Cash Flows Matter Most to Investors

Cash is what investors ultimately care about when making an investment. The value of any asset—a share of stock, a bond, or a business—is determined by the cash flows it is expected to generate in the future. To understand this concept, just consider how much you would pay for an asset from which you could never expect to obtain any cash flows. Buying such an asset would be like giving your money away. It would have a value of exactly zero. Conversely, as the expected cash flows from an investment increase, you would be willing to pay more and more for it.

A firm is unprofitable when it fails to generate sufficient cash inflows to pay operating expenses, creditors, and taxes. Firms that are unprofitable over time will be forced into bankruptcy by their creditors if the owners do not shut them down first. In bankruptcy the company will be reorganized or the company’s assets will be liquidated, whichever is more valuable. If the company is liquidated, creditors are paid in a priority order according to the structure of the firm’s financial contracts and prevailing bankruptcy law. If anything is left after all creditor and tax claims have been satisfied, which usually does not happen, the remaining cash, or residual value, is distributed to the owners.

bankruptcy legally declared inability of an individual or a company to pay its creditors

Three Fundamental Decisions in Financial Management
Based on our discussion so far, we can see that financial managers are concerned with three fundamental decisions when running a business:

Capital budgeting decisions: Identifying the productive assets the firm should buy.
Financing decisions: Determining how the firm should finance or pay for assets.
Working capital management decisions: Determining how day-to-day financial matters should be managed so that the firm can pay its bills, and how surplus cash should be invested.
Exhibit 1.2 shows the impact of each decision on the firm’s balance sheet. We briefly introduce each decision here and discuss them in greater detail in later chapters.

Capital Budgeting Decisions

A firm’s capital budget is simply a list of the productive (capital) assets that management wants to purchase over a budget cycle, typically one year. The capital budgeting decision process addresses which productive assets the firm should purchase and how much money the firm can afford to spend. As shown in Exhibit 1.2, capital budgeting decisions affect the asset side of the balance sheet and are concerned with a firm’s long-term investments. Capital budgeting decisions, as we mentioned earlier, are among management’s most important decisions. Over the long run, they have a large impact on the firm’s success or failure. The reason is twofold. First, capital (productive) assets generate most of the cash flows for the firm. Second, capital assets are long term in nature. Once they are purchased, the firm owns them for a long time, and they may be hard to sell without taking a financial loss.

EXHIBIT 1.2 How the Financial Manager’s Decisions Affect the Balance Sheet Financial managers are concerned with three fundamental types of decisions: capital budgeting decisions, financing decisions, and working capital management decisions. Each type of decision has a direct and important effect on the firm’s balance sheet and, ultimately, the success or failure of the firm.


The fundamental question in capital budgeting is this: Which productive assets should the firm purchase? A capital budgeting decision may be as simple as a movie theater’s decision to buy a popcorn machine or as complicated as Boeing’s decision to invest more than $6 billion to design and build the 787 Dreamliner passenger jet. Capital investments may also involve the purchase of an entire business, such as Fintech giant Intuit’s acquisition of the consumer technology company Credit Karma for approximately $7.1 billion.

Regardless of the project, a good investment is one in which the benefits are worth more to the firm than the costs of the asset. For example, in February 2020 Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $13 billion to acquire E*TRADE. The acquisition of E*TRADE would give Morgan Stanley access to E*TRADE’s more than 5.2 million retail client accounts with over $360 billion in assets invested, complementing its existing wealth management business. Presumably, Morgan Stanley expects that the investment will produce a stream of future cash flows worth more than the $13 billion it agreed to pay. Suppose that Morgan Stanley estimates that in terms of the current market value, the future cash flows it can generate from E*TRADE’s client accounts are worth about $17 billion. Is the purchase a good deal for Morgan Stanley? The answer is yes because the value of the expected cash flow benefits from the purchase exceeds the cost by $4 billion ($17 billion − $13 billion = $4 billion). If the purchase of E*TRADE works out as planned, the value of Morgan Stanley will increase by $4 billion!

Building Intuition
Sound Investments Are Those Where the Value of the Benefits Exceeds Their Cost

Financial managers should invest in a capital project only if the value of its future cash flows exceeds the cost of the project (benefits > cost). Such investments increase the value of the firm and thus increase stockholders’ (owners’) wealth. This rule holds whether you’re making the decision to purchase new machinery, build a new plant, or buy an entire business.

Not all investment decisions are successful. Just open the business section of any newspaper on any day, and you will find stories of bad decisions. For example, Universal Pictures’ 2019 CGI movie Cats reportedly cost over $100 million in production and advertising expenses, but made only $10.9 million in worldwide box office receipts. Even with sales of future streaming rights, the overall cash flows for the movie will not come close to covering its up-front costs.

Financing Decisions

Financing decisions determine how firms raise cash to pay for their investments, as shown in Exhibit 1.2. Productive assets, which are long term in nature, are financed by long-term borrowing, equity investment, or both. Financing decisions involve trade-offs between the advantages and disadvantages of these financing alternatives for the firm.

A major advantage of debt financing is that interest payments are tax deductible for many corporations. However, debt financing increases a firm’s risk because it creates a contractual obligation to make periodic interest payments and, at maturity, to repay the amount that is borrowed. These obligations must be paid regardless of the firm’s operating cash flow, even if the firm suffers a financial loss. If the firm fails to make payments as promised, it defaults on its debt obligation and could be forced into bankruptcy.

In contrast, equity has no maturity, and there are no guaranteed payments to equity investors. In a corporation, the board of directors has the right to decide whether dividends should be paid to stockholders. This means that if a dividend payment is reduced or omitted altogether, the firm will not be in default. Unlike interest payments, however, dividend payments to stockholders are not tax deductible.

Building Intuition
Financing Decisions Affect the Value of the Firm

How a firm is financed with debt and equity affects the value of the firm. The reason is that the mix between debt and equity affects the taxes the firm pays and the probability that the firm will go bankrupt. The financial manager’s goal is to determine the combination of debt and equity that minimizes the cost of financing the firm.

The mix of debt and equity on the balance sheet is known as a firm’s capital structure. The term capital structure is used because long-term funds are considered capital, and these funds are raised in capital markets—financial markets where equity and debt instruments with maturities greater than one year are traded.

capital markets financial markets where equity and debt instruments with maturities greater than one year are traded

Working Capital Management Decisions

Management must also decide how to manage the firm’s current assets, such as cash, inventory, and accounts receivable, as well as its current liabilities, such as trade credit and accounts payable. The dollar difference between a firm’s total current assets and its total current liabilities is called its net working capital, as shown in Exhibit 1.2. As mentioned earlier, working capital management is the day-to-day management of the firm’s short-term assets and liabilities. The goals of managing working capital are to ensure that the firm has enough cash to pay its bills and invest any spare cash to earn interest.

net working capital the dollar difference between total current assets and total current liabilities

The mismanagement of working capital can cause a firm to default on its debt and go into bankruptcy, even though, over the long term, the firm may be profitable. For example, a firm that makes sales to customers on credit but is not diligent about collecting the accounts receivable can quickly find itself without enough cash to pay its bills. If this condition becomes chronic, and the firm is unable to obtain alternative financing, creditors can force the firm into bankruptcy.

A firm’s profitability can also be affected by its inventory level. If the firm has more inventory than it needs to meet customer demands, it has too much capital tied up in assets that are not earning cash. Conversely, if the firm holds too little inventory, it can lose sales because it does not have products to sell when customers want them. Management must therefore determine the optimal inventory level.

1.2 Forms of Business Organization
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Identify common forms of business organization in the United States and their respective strengths and weaknesses.
Firms are organized in a number of different ways in the United States. In this section we discuss some of the more common forms of organization and the factors that business owners consider when they choose which to use. Exhibit 1.3 summarizes key characteristics of common forms of business organization.

Sole Proprietorships
A sole proprietorship is a business that is owned by a single person. Its life is limited to the period that the owner (proprietor) is associated with the business because there is no ownership interest that can be transferred to someone else—there is no stock or other such interest that can be sold. A sole proprietorship ceases to exist when the proprietor stops being involved with the business. Many small businesses in the United States are organized this way.

sole proprietorship a business owned by a single person

EXHIBIT 1.3 Characteristics of Different Forms of Business Organization

Choosing the appropriate form of business organization is an important step in starting a business. This exhibit compares key characteristics of the most popular forms of business organization in the United States.

 	Sole Proprietorship	Partnership	Corporation	Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or Company (LLC)
General	Limited	S-Corp.	C-Corp.

Tax treatment of income	Flow-through	Flow-through	Flow-through	Flow-through	Double tax	As elected
Tax deductibility of owner benefits	Limited	Limited	Limited	Limited	Less limited	Limited
A sole proprietorship is the simplest and least expensive form of business to set up and is the least regulated. To start a sole proprietorship, all you have to do is obtain the business licenses required by your local and state governments.

The ownership structure of a sole proprietorship has both advantages and disadvantages. Among the advantages is the fact that the proprietor does not have to share decision making with anyone and can run the business as he or she chooses.

There are several disadvantages related to the fact that there is no stock or other ownership interest to sell to others. First, the amount of equity capital that can be raised to finance the business is limited to the owner’s personal wealth. This can restrict growth for the business unless the proprietor is very wealthy. Second, it can be more costly to transfer ownership. The proprietor must sell the assets of the business directly, rather than indirectly through the sale of an ownership interest in an operating business. The business must essentially be re-established every time it is sold. Third, because the proprietor provides all of the equity capital and manages the business, there is no separation of the management and investment roles. This limits the ability of good managers to form a business if they do not also have capital to invest. Fourth, it is not possible to provide employees with compensation in the form of ownership interests, such as stock or stock options, which can motivate them to work harder.

Another disadvantage of a sole proprietorship is that proprietor faces unlimited liability. If someone is harmed by the business, the proprietor’s liability extends beyond the money invested in the business. The proprietor can lose some or all of his or her personal wealth, too.

Finally, profits from a sole proprietorship flow through to the proprietor’s personal tax return, meaning that the business does not pay taxes before profits are distributed to the owner. Because the business is not subject to income taxes, profits are not subject to double taxation as in a C-corporation (described later). There are limitations on tax deductions for personal expenses, such as those associated with health insurance, but the costs of these limitations are often outweighed by the benefits from the flow-through of profits in a sole proprietorship.

Partnerships
A partnership consists of two or more owners who have joined together legally to manage a business. To form a partnership, the owners (partners) enter into an agreement that details how much capital each partner will invest in the partnership, what their management roles will be, how key management decisions will be made, how the profits will be divided, and how ownership will be transferred in case of specified events, such as the retirement or death of a partner. A general partnership is a partnership in which all of the partners are owners of (investors in) the business and active in managing it. In contrast, a limited partnership has both general partners, who are owners and managers, and limited partners, who are owners but not managers.

partnership two or more owners who have joined together legally to manage a business and share its profits

Partnerships are more costly to form than sole proprietorships because the partners must hire an attorney to draw up and maintain the partnership agreement, which specifies the nature of the relationships between or among the partners. On the other hand, partnership agreements can be amended to allow for the business to continue when a partner leaves. The ability to make the life of a business independent of that of the partners makes it easier to raise capital and less costly for the partners to sell their interests at an attractive price.

Many of the other advantages and disadvantages of a general partnership are similar to those of a sole proprietorship. A key disadvantage of a general partnership is that, like the proprietor in a sole proprietorship, all partners have unlimited liability. This liability can be even worse than in a sole proprietorship because a general partner can be held liable for all of the partnership’s debts and other obligations, regardless of what proportion of the business he or she owns or how the debt or other obligations were incurred.

The problem of unlimited liability is avoided for some partners in a limited partnership because limited partners can generally only lose the amount of money that they have invested in the business. In a limited partnership, the general partners have unlimited liability and actively manage the business, while each limited partner is liable for business obligations only up to the amount of capital he or she invested in the partnership. In other words, the limited partners have limited liability.

limited liability a structure in which the legal liability of an investor is limited to the amount of capital invested in the business

Corporations
Most large businesses are organized as corporations. A corporation is a legal entity authorized under a state charter. In a legal sense, it is a “person” distinct from its owners. For example, corporations can sue and be sued, enter into contracts, borrow money, and own assets. They can also be general or limited partners in partnerships, and they can own stock in certain types of other corporations. Because a corporation is an entity that is distinct from its owners, it can have an indefinite life. Corporations hold the majority of all business assets and generate the majority of business revenues and profits in the United States. The owners of a corporation are its stockholders.

corporation a legal entity formed and authorized under a state charter; in a legal sense, a corporation is a “person” distinct from its owners

Starting a corporation is more costly than starting a sole proprietorship. For example, it requires writing articles of incorporation and by-laws that conform to the laws of the state of incorporation. These documents spell out the name of the corporation, its business purpose, its intended life span (unless explicitly stated otherwise, the life is indefinite), the amount of stock to be issued, and the number of directors and their responsibilities. Over the life of a successful business, these costs are not very important. However, to a cash-strapped entrepreneur, they can seem substantial.

On the other hand, the corporate form of organization has several advantages. For example, shares in a corporation can be sold to raise capital from investors who are not involved in the business. This can greatly increase the amount of capital that can be raised to fund the business.

Another major advantage of a corporation is that stockholders have limited liability for debts and other obligations. Owners of corporations have limited liability because corporations are legal persons that take actions in their own names, not in the names of individual owners.

An S-corporation is a form of corporation that can be used by private businesses that meet certain requirements. An S-corporation can have only one class of stock and cannot have more than one hundred stockholders or any stockholders that are corporations or nonresident alien investors. In contrast, a C-corporation, which is the form used by public corporations, does not face such limits.

While there are more restrictions on S-corporations, there are also advantages. Specifically, all profits earned by an S-corporation pass directly to the stockholders, just as they pass to a sole proprietor or the partners in a partnership. This means that no taxes are paid at the corporate level.

In contrast, a major disadvantage of a C-corporation is that it must pay taxes on the income it earns. If the corporation pays a cash dividend, the stockholders must also pay taxes on the dividends they receive. Thus, the owners of C-corporations are subject to double taxation—first at the corporate level and then at the personal level when they receive dividends.

Corporations can be classified as public or private. Most large companies prefer to operate as public corporations because large amounts of capital can be raised in public markets at a relatively low cost. Public markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ, are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).2

public markets markets regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission in which securities such as stocks and bonds are publicly traded

In contrast, privately held, or closely held, corporations are owned by a small number of investors, and their shares are not traded publicly. When a corporation is first formed, the common stock is often held by a few investors, typically the founder, a small number of key managers, and financial backers. Over time, as the company grows in size and needs larger amounts of capital, management may decide that the company should “go public” in order to gain access to the public markets.

privately held, or closely held, corporations corporations whose stock is not traded in the public markets

Limited Liability Partnerships and Companies

Historically, law firms, accounting firms, investment banks, and other professional groups were organized as sole proprietorships or partnerships. For partners in these firms, all income was taxed as personal income, and general partners had unlimited liability for all debts and other obligations of the firm. It was widely believed that in professional partnerships, such as those of attorneys, accountants, or physicians, the partners should be liable individually and collectively for the professional conduct of each partner. This structure gave the partners an incentive to monitor each other’s professional conduct and discipline poorly performing partners, resulting in a higher quality of service and greater professional integrity. Financially, however, misconduct by one partner could result in disaster for the entire firm. For example, a physician found guilty of malpractice exposes every partner in the medical practice to financial liability, even if the others never treated the patient in question.

In the 1980s, because of sharp increases in the number of professional malpractice cases and large damages awards in the courts, professional groups began lobbying state legislators to create hybrid forms of business organization. One such hybrid is known as a limited liability partnership (LLP). An LLP combines some of the limited liability characteristics of a corporation with the tax advantage of a partnership. While liability varies from state to state, LLP partners in general have more limited liability than general partners in regular partnerships. Typically, they are not personally liable for any other partner’s malpractice or professional misconduct. As in regular partnerships, income to the partners of an LLP is taxed as personal income.

limited liability partnership (LLP) and limited liability company (LLC) hybrid business organizations that combine some of the advantages of corporations and partnerships; in general, income to the partners is taxed only as personal income, but the partners have limited liability

A limited liability company (LLC) is another hybrid form of organization that is becoming increasingly common. Like LLPs, LLCs have benefited founders of many businesses that would otherwise have been organized as limited partnerships. They also provide limited liability to the people who make the business decisions in the firm while enabling all investors to retain the flow-through tax advantages of a limited partnership.

You will notice that Exhibit 1.3 indicates that the lives of partnerships, LLPs, and LLCs are flexible. This is because, while partnership, LLP, and LLC agreements can be written so that their lives are indefinite, they can also be written with a fixed life in mind. For example, private equity and venture capital limited partnerships and LLCs are typically structured so that they last only 10 years.

1.3 Managing the Financial Function
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the typical organization of the financial function in a large corporation.
As we discussed earlier, financial managers are concerned with a firm’s investment, financing, and working capital management decisions. The senior financial manager holds one of the top executive positions in the firm. In a large corporation, the senior financial manager usually has the rank of vice president or senior vice president and goes by the title of chief financial officer or CFO. In smaller firms, the job tends to focus more on the accounting function, and the top financial officer may be called the controller or chief accountant. In this section we focus on the financial function in a large corporation.

chief financial officer or CFO the most senior financial manager in a company

Organizational Structure
Exhibit 1.4 shows a typical organizational structure for a large corporation, with special attention to the financial function. As shown, the top management position in the firm is the chief executive officer (CEO), who has the final decision-making authority among all the firm’s executives. The CEO’s most important responsibilities are to set the strategic direction of the firm and see that the management team executes the strategic plan. The CEO reports directly to the board of directors, which is accountable to the company’s stockholders. The board’s responsibility is to see that the top management makes decisions that are in the best interest of the stockholders.

The CFO reports directly to the CEO and focuses on managing all aspects of the firm’s finances, as well as working closely with the CEO on strategic issues. A number of positions report directly to the CFO. In addition, the CFO often interacts with people in other functional areas on a regular basis because all senior executives are involved in financial decisions that affect the firm and their areas of responsibility.

Positions Reporting to the CFO
Exhibit 1.4 also shows the positions that typically report to the CFO in a large corporation and the activities managed in each area.

EXHIBIT 1.4 Simplified Corporate Organization Chart The firm’s top finance and accounting executive is the CFO, who reports directly to the CEO. Positions that report directly to the CFO include the treasurer, risk manager, and controller. The internal auditor reports both to the CFO and to the audit committee of the board of directors. The external auditor and the compliance and ethics director also are ultimately responsible to the audit committee.


The treasurer looks after the collection and disbursement of cash, investing excess cash so that it earns interest, raising new capital, handling foreign exchange transactions, and overseeing the firm’s pension fund managers. The treasurer also assists the CFO in handling important Wall Street relationships, such as those with investment bankers and credit rating agencies.
The risk manager monitors and manages the firm’s risk exposure in financial and commodity markets and the firm’s relationships with insurance providers.
The controller is really the firm’s chief accounting officer. The controller’s staff prepares the financial statements, maintains the firm’s financial and cost accounting systems, prepares the taxes, and works closely with the firm’s external auditors.
The internal auditor is responsible for identifying and assessing major risks facing the firm and performing audits in areas where the firm might incur substantial losses. The internal auditor reports to the board of directors as well as the CFO.
External Auditor
Virtually every large corporation hires a licensed certified public accounting (CPA) firm to provide an independent annual audit of the firm’s financial statements. Through this audit the CPA comes to a conclusion as to whether the firm’s financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the firm and results of its activities, or in other words, whether the financial numbers are reasonably accurate, accounting principles have been consistently applied year to year and do not significantly distort the firm’s performance, and the accounting principles used conform to those generally accepted by the accounting profession. Creditors and investors require independent audits, and the SEC requires publicly traded firms to supply audited financial statements.

The Audit Committee
The audit committee, a powerful subcommittee of the board of directors, has the responsibility of overseeing the accounting function and the preparation of the firm’s financial statements. In addition, the audit committee oversees or, if necessary, conducts investigations of significant fraud, theft, or malfeasance in the firm, especially if it is suspected that senior managers in the firm may be involved.

The external auditor reports directly to the audit committee to help ensure his or her independence from management. On a day-to-day basis, however, the external auditor works closely with the CFO’s staff. The internal auditor also reports to the audit committee to help ensure his or her independence from management. On a day-to-day basis, however, the internal auditor, like the external auditor, works closely with the CFO staff.

The Compliance and Ethics Director
Many publicly traded companies have a compliance and ethics director who oversees three mandated programs: (1) a compliance program that ensures that the firm complies with federal and state laws and regulations, (2) an ethics program that promotes ethical conduct among executives and other employees, and (3) a compliance hotline, which must include a whistleblower program. Like the internal auditor, the compliance director reports to the audit committee to ensure independence from management, though on a day-to-day basis the director typically reports to the firm’s legal counsel.

1.4 The Goal of the Firm
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain why maximizing the value of the firm’s stock is the appropriate goal for management.
For business owners, it is important to determine the appropriate goal for management decisions. Should the goal be to try to keep costs as low as possible? Or to maximize sales or market share? Or to achieve steady growth and earnings? Let’s look at this fundamental question more closely.

What Should Management Maximize?
Suppose you own and manage a pizza parlor. Depending on your preferences and tolerance for risk, you can set any goal for the business that you want. For example, you might have a fear of bankruptcy and losing money. To avoid the risk of bankruptcy, you could focus on keeping your costs as low as possible, paying low wages, avoiding borrowing, advertising minimally, and remaining reluctant to expand the business. In short, you will avoid any action that increases your firm’s risk. You will sleep well at night, but you may eat poorly because of meager profits.

Conversely, you could focus on maximizing market share and becoming the largest pizza business in town. Your strategy might include cutting prices to increase sales, borrowing heavily to open new pizza parlors, spending lavishly on advertising, and developing exotic menu items such as pizza de foie gras. In the short run, your high-risk, high-growth strategy will have you both eating poorly and sleeping poorly as you push the firm to the edge. In the long run, you will either become very rich or go bankrupt! There must be a better operational goal than either of these extremes.

Why Not Maximize Profits?
One goal for decision making that seems reasonable is profit maximization. After all, don’t stockholders and business owners want their companies to be profitable? Although profit maximization seems a logical goal for a business, it has some serious drawbacks.

A problem with profit maximization is that it is hard to pin down what is meant by “profit.” To the average businessperson, profits are just revenues minus expenses. To an accountant, however, a decision that increases profits under one set of accounting rules can reduce it under another. A second problem is that accounting profits are not necessarily the same as cash flows. For example, many firms recognize revenues at the time a sale is made, which is typically before the cash payment for the sale is received. Ultimately, the owners of a business want cash because only cash can be used to make investments or to buy goods and services.

Building Intuition
The Timing of Cash Flows Affects Their Value

A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because if you have a dollar today, you can invest it and earn interest. For businesses, cash flows can involve large sums of money, and receiving money one day late can cost a great deal. For example, if a bank has $100 billion of consumer loans outstanding and the average annual interest payment is 5 percent, it would cost the bank $13.7 million if every consumer decided to make an interest payment one day later.

Yet another problem with profit maximization as a goal is that it does not distinguish between getting a dollar today and getting a dollar some time in the future. In finance, the timing of cash flows is extremely important. For example, the longer you go without paying your credit card balance, the more interest you must pay the bank for the use of the money. The interest accrues because of the time value of money; the longer you have access to money, the more you have to pay for it. The time value of money is one of the most important concepts in finance and is the focus of Chapters 5 and 6.

Finally, profit maximization ignores the uncertainty, or risk, associated with cash flows. A basic principle of finance is that there is a trade-off between expected return and risk. When given a choice between two investments that have the same expected returns but different risk, most people choose the less risky one. This makes sense because most people do not like bearing risk and, as a result, must be compensated for taking it. The profit maximization goal ignores differences in value caused by differences in risk. We return to the important topics of risk, its measurement, and the trade-off between risk and return in Chapter 7. What is important at this time is that you understand that investors do not like risk and must be compensated for bearing it.

Building Intuition
The Riskiness of Cash Flows Affects Their Value

A risky dollar is worth less than a safe dollar. The reason is that investors do not like risk and must be compensated for bearing it. For example, if two investments have the same expected return—say, 5 percent—most people will prefer the investment with the lower risk. Thus, the more risky an investment’s cash flows, the less it is worth.

In sum, it appears that profit maximization is not an appropriate goal for a firm because the concept is difficult to define and does not directly account for the firm’s cash flows. What we need is a goal that looks at a firm’s cash flows and considers both their timing and their riskiness. Fortunately, we have just such a measure: the market value of the firm’s stock.

Maximize the Value of the Firm’s Stock
The underlying value of any asset is determined by the cash flows it is expected to generate in the future. This principle holds whether we are buying a bank certificate of deposit, a corporate bond, or an office building. Furthermore, as we will discuss in Chapter 9, when security analysts and investors on Wall Street determine the value of a firm’s stock, they consider (1) the size of the expected cash flows, (2) the timing of the cash flows, and (3) the riskiness of the cash flows. Notice that the mechanism for determining stock values overcomes all the cash flow objections we raised with regard to profit maximization as a goal.

Thus, an appropriate goal for management is to maximize the current value of the firm’s stock. Maximizing the value of the firm’s stock is an unambiguous objective that is easy to measure for a firm whose stock is traded in a public market. We simply look at the market value of the stock online on a given day to determine the value of the stockholders’ shares and whether the price went up or down. Publicly traded securities are ideally suited for this task because public markets are wholesale markets with large numbers of buyers and sellers where securities trade near their true value.

What about firms whose stock is not publicly traded, such as private corporations and partnerships? The total value of the stockholder or partner interests in such a business is equal to the value of the owner’s equity. Thus, our goal can be restated for these firms as this: Maximize the current value of owner’s equity. The only other restriction is that the entities must be for-profit businesses.

Building Intuition
The Financial Manager’s Goal Is to Maximize the Value of the Firm’s Stock

The goal for financial managers is to make decisions that maximize the firm’s stock price. By maximizing stock price, management will help maximize stockholders’ wealth. To do this, managers must make investment and financing decisions so that the total value of cash inflows exceeds the total value of cash outflows by the greatest possible amount (benefits > costs). Notice that the focus is on maximizing the value of cash flows, not profits.

It is important to recognize that maximizing the value of stock is not inconsistent with maximizing the value of claims to the firm’s other stakeholders. In maximizing the value of the stock, managers must make decisions that account for the interests of all stakeholders. Consider an instance where the managers of a firm decide to delay paying suppliers in an effort to increase the cash flows to the firm’s owners. This delay is likely to be met by resistance from suppliers, who might increase the prices they charge the firm in order to offset the cost of this policy to them. In the extreme, suppliers might even stop selling their products to the firm. This notion that firms must recognize the interests of stakeholders is succinctly summarized in IBM’s 2019 annual report, which states: “Our business model is built to deliver long-term value to stakeholders.” In maximizing the value of the owner’s equity, managers must make decisions that account for the interests of all stakeholders.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in companies are an example of initiatives focused on an important class of stakeholders, the employees, with the intent to maximize stockholder value. DEI programs seek to bring people from diverse backgrounds— from the standpoint of age, gender, religion, etc.—to be part of the workplace and include them in decision-making process throughout the organization. Numerous studies suggest that diversity improves both financial performance and innovation, ultimately benefitting the corporate bottom line. For example, a recent report by McKinsey & Company noted that “Companies in the top-quartile for ethnic/cultural diversity on executive teams were 33% more likely to have industry-leading profitability.”3

Over the last decade, financial managers have also increasingly directed their attention to issues associated with the environmental, social, and governance strategies of the firm. These factors, commonly referred to as “ESG,” have drawn the attention of customers and investors alike, suggesting that they are very important determinants of the value of a company’s stock. While the concept of ESG is quite broad, many associate the term with issues of sustainability and corporate social responsibility in evaluating the impact of the firm’s operations on the broader community. In keeping with this movement, The Business Roundtable, a group of chief executive officers of nearly 200 major U.S. corporations, issued a statement in 2019 with a new definition of the “purpose of a corporation.” As part of this statement, the CEOs emphasized that the main goals of business include investing in employees, delivering value to customers, dealing ethically with suppliers, and supporting outside communities. In response to the interests of both consumers and investors, public companies often explicitly report on their ESG-related activities, and the quality of corporate ESG strategies are rated by a variety of investment advisors.

Can Management Decisions Affect Stock Prices?
An important question is whether management decisions actually affect the firm’s stock price. Fortunately, the answer is yes. As noted earlier, a basic principle in finance is that the value of an asset is determined by the future cash flows it is expected to generate. As shown in Exhibit 1.5, a firm’s management makes numerous decisions that affect its cash flows. For example, management decides what type of products or services to produce and what productive assets to purchase. Managers also make decisions concerning the mix of debt and equity financing the firm uses, debt collection policies, and policies for paying suppliers, to mention a few examples. In addition, cash flows are affected by how efficient management is in making products, the quality of the products, management’s sales and marketing skills, and the firm’s investment in research and development for new products. Some of these decisions affect cash flows over the long term, such as the decision to build a new plant, and other decisions have a short-term impact on cash flows, such as launching an advertising campaign. For example, on November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced a successful trial outcome tied to its experimental COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer’s stock price increased by almost 10 percent on the day of the announcement, suggesting that the vaccine was expected to have a positive impact on the firm’s long-run cash flows.

The firm’s managers also must deal with a number of external factors over which they have little or no control, such as economic conditions (recession or expansion), war or peace, and new government regulations. External factors are constantly changing, and management must weigh the impact of these changes and adjust its strategy and decisions accordingly.

The important point here is that, over time, management makes a series of decisions when executing the firm’s strategy that affects the firm’s cash flows and, hence, the price of the firm’s stock. Firms that have a better business strategy, are more nimble, make better business decisions, and can execute their plans well will have a higher stock price than similar firms that just can’t get it right.

EXHIBIT 1.5 Major Factors Affecting Stock Prices The firm’s stock price is affected by a number of factors, and management can control only some of them. Managers exercise little control over external conditions (blue boxes), such as the state of the general economy, although they can closely observe these conditions and make appropriate changes in strategy. Managers make many other decisions that directly affect the firm’s expected cash flows (green boxes)—and hence the price of the firm’s stock.

1.5 Agency Conflicts: Separation of Ownership and Control
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss how agency conflicts affect the goal of maximizing stockholder value.
We turn next to an important issue facing stockholders of large corporations: the separation of ownership and control of the firm. In a large corporation, ownership is often spread over a large number of small stockholders who may have little control over management. Managers may therefore make decisions that benefit their own interests rather than those of the stockholders. In contrast, in smaller firms, owners and managers are usually one and the same, and there is no conflict of interest between them. As you will see, this self-interested behavior may affect the value of the firm.

Ownership and Control
To illustrate, let’s continue with our pizza parlor example. As the owner of a pizza parlor, you have decided your goal is to maximize the value of the business and thereby your ownership interest. There is no conflict of interest in your dual roles as owner and manager because your personal and economic self-interest is tied to the success of the pizza parlor. The restaurant has succeeded because you have worked hard and have focused on customer satisfaction.

Now suppose you decide to hire a college student to manage the restaurant. Will the new manager always act in your interest? Or could the new manager be tempted to give free pizza to friends now and then or, after an exhausting day, leave early rather than spend time cleaning and preparing for the next day? From this example, you can see that once ownership and management are separated, managers may be tempted to pursue goals that are in their own self-interest rather than the interests of the owners.

Agency Relationships
The relationship we have just described between the pizza parlor owner and the student manager is an example of an agency relationship. An agency relationship arises whenever one party, called the principal, hires another party, called the agent, to perform some service on behalf of the principal. The relationship between stockholders and management is an agency relationship. Legally, managers (who are the agents) have a fiduciary duty to the stockholders (the principals), which means managers are obligated to put the interests of the stockholders above their own. However, in these and all other agency relationships, the potential exists for a conflict of interest between the principal and the agent. These conflicts are called agency conflicts.

agency conflicts conflicts of interest between a principal and an agent

Do Managers Really Want to Maximize Stock Price?
It is not difficult to see how conflicts of interest between managers and stockholders can arise in the corporate setting. In most large corporations, especially those that are publicly traded, there is a significant degree of separation between ownership and management. The largest corporations can have more than one million stockholders. As a practical matter, it is not possible for all of the stockholders to be active in the management of the firm or to individually bear the high cost of monitoring management. The bottom line is that stockholders own the corporation, but managers control the money and have the opportunity to use it for their own benefit.

How might management be tempted to indulge itself and pursue its self-interest? We need not look far for an answer to this question. Corporate excesses are common. High on the list are palatial office buildings, corporate hunting and fishing lodges in exotic places, expensive corporate jets, extravagant expense-account dinners kicked off with bottles of Dom Perignon and washed down with 1953 Margaux—and, of course, a king’s compensation package.4 Besides economic nest feathering, corporate managers may focus on maximizing market share, their industry prestige, and their job security.

Needless to say, these types of activities and spending conflict with the goal of maximizing a firm’s stock price. The costs of these activities are called agency costs. Agency costs are the costs incurred because of conflicts of interest between a principal and an agent. Examples are the cost of the lavish dinner mentioned earlier and the cost of a corporate jet for executives. However, not all agency costs are frivolous. The cost of hiring an external auditor to certify financial statements is also an agency cost because it is a cost that is incurred to limit actions by managers that result in agency costs.

agency costs the costs arising from conflicts of interest between a principal and an agent—for example, between a firm’s owners and its managers

Aligning the Interests of Managers and Stockholders
If the linkage between stockholder and manager goals is weak, a number of mechanisms can help to better align the behavior of managers with the goals of stockholders. These include (1) board of directors, (2) management compensation, (3) managerial labor market, (4) other managers, (5) large stockholders, (6) the takeover market, and (7) the legal and regulatory environment.

Board of Directors

A corporation’s board of directors has a legal responsibility to represent stockholders’ interests. The board’s duties include hiring and firing the CEO, setting his or her compensation, and monitoring his or her performance. The board also approves major decisions concerning the firm, such as the firm’s annual capital budget or the acquisition of another business. These responsibilities make the board a key mechanism for ensuring that managers’ decisions are aligned with the interests of stockholders.

How well boards actually perform in this role has been questioned in recent years. As an example, critics point out that some boards are unwilling to make hard decisions such as firing the CEO when a firm performs poorly. Other people believe that a lack of independence from management is a reason that boards are not as effective as they might be. For example, the CEO often chairs the board of directors. This dual position can give the CEO undue influence over the board, as the chairperson sets the agenda for and chairs board meetings, appoints committees, and controls the flow of information to the board.

Management Compensation

The most effective means of aligning the interests of managers with those of stockholders is a well-designed compensation (pay) package that rewards managers when they do what stockholders want them to do and penalizes them when they do not. This type of plan is effective because a manager will quickly internalize the benefits and costs of making good and bad decisions and, thus, will be more likely to make the decisions that stockholders want. Therefore, there is no need for some outside monitor, such as the board of directors, to try to figure out whether the managers are making the right decisions. The information that outside monitors have is not as good as the managers’ information, so these outside monitors are always at a disadvantage in trying to determine whether a manager is acting in the interest of stockholders.

Most corporations have management compensation plans that tie compensation to the performance of the firm. The idea behind these plans is that if compensation is sensitive to the performance of the firm, managers will have greater incentives to make decisions that increase the stockholders’ wealth. Although these incentive plans vary widely, they usually include (1) a base salary, (2) a bonus based on accounting performance, and (3) some compensation that is tied to the firm’s stock price.5 The base salary ensures the executive of receiving some minimum compensation as long as he or she remains with the firm, and the bonus and stock price–based compensation are designed to align the manager’s incentives with those of the stockholders. The trick in designing such a program is to choose the right mix of these three components so that the manager has the right incentives and the overall package is sufficiently appealing to attract and retain high-quality managers at the lowest possible cost.

Managerial Labor Market

The managerial labor market also provides managers with incentives to act in the interests of stockholders. Firms that have a history of poor performance or a reputation for “shady operations” or unethical behavior have difficulty hiring top managerial talent. Individuals who are top performers have better alternatives than to work for such firms. Therefore, to the extent that managers want to attract high-quality people, the labor market provides incentives to run a good company.

Furthermore, studies show that executives who “manage” firms into bankruptcy or are convicted of white-collar crimes can rarely secure equivalent positions after being fired for poor performance or convicted for criminal behavior. Thus, the penalty for extremely poor performance or a criminal conviction is a significant reduction in the manager’s lifetime earnings potential. Managers know this, and the fear of such consequences helps keep them working hard and honestly.6

Other Managers

Competition among managers within firms also helps provide incentives for each manager to act in the interests of stockholders. Managers compete to attain the CEO position and in doing so try to attract the board of directors’ attention by acting in the stockholders’ interests. Furthermore, even when a manager becomes CEO, he or she is always looking over his or her shoulder because other managers covet that job.

Large Stockholders

All stockholders have an interest in providing managers with incentives to maximize stockholder value. However, as we noted earlier, most stockholders in large corporations own too few shares to make it worthwhile for them to actively monitor managers. Only large stockholders, those with a significant investment in the firm, have enough money at stake and enough power to make it worthwhile for them to actively monitor managers and to try to influence their decisions. For firms that are publicly traded, many of the large stockholders are institutional investors, such as mutual funds, large commercial banks, or hedge funds.

The Takeover Market

The market for takeovers provides incentives for managers to act in the interests of stockholders. When a firm performs poorly because its current managers are doing a poor job, an opportunity arises for astute investors, so-called corporate raiders, to make money by buying the company at a price that reflects its poor performance and replacing the current managers with a top-flight management team. If the investors have evaluated the situation correctly, the firm will soon be transformed into a strong performer, its stock price will increase, and investors can sell their stock for a significant profit. The possibility that a firm might be discovered by corporate raiders provides incentives for managers to perform well.

The Legal and Regulatory Environment

Finally, the laws and regulations that firms must adhere to limit the ability of managers to make decisions that harm the interests of stockholders. An example is federal and state statutes that make it illegal for managers to steal corporate assets. Similarly, regulatory reforms such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, discussed next, limit the ability of managers to mislead stockholders.

Sarbanes-Oxley and Other Regulatory Reforms
Managers of public firms in the United States have long been required to make audited financial statements available to investors that show how their firms have been performing, what their assets are, and how those assets have been financed. Prior to 1933, these disclosure requirements were specified by the individual states in which firms were incorporated. Since the passage of the Securities Act of 1933, also known as the Truth in Securities Act, these requirements have been standardized throughout the country. They have evolved to the point at which financial reports must adhere to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which are discussed in Chapter 3.

With the longstanding disclosure requirements for public firms, many investors during the latter part of the 1900s were comfortable with the quality of corporate financial statements. However, a series of accounting scandals and ethical lapses by corporate officers shocked the nation in the early years of the twenty-first century. A case in point was WorldCom’s bankruptcy filing in 2002 and the admission that its officers had “cooked the books” by misstating $7.2 billion of expenses, which allowed WorldCom to report profits when the firm had actually lost money. The accounting fraud at WorldCom followed similar scandals at Enron, Global Crossing, Tyco, and elsewhere. These scandals—and the resulting losses to stockholders— led to a set of far-reaching regulatory reforms passed by Congress in 2002.7 The most significant reform measure to date is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which focuses on (1) reducing agency costs in corporations, (2) restoring ethical conduct within the business sector, and (3) improving the integrity of the accounting reporting system within firms.

Overall, these regulations require all public corporations to implement five overarching strategies. (Private corporations and partnerships are not required to implement these measures.)

Ensure greater board independence. Firms must structure their boards so that the majority of the members are outside directors. Furthermore, it is recommended that the positions of chair and CEO be separated. Finally, Sarbanes-Oxley makes it clear that board members have a fiduciary responsibility to represent and act in the interest of stockholders, and board members who fail to meet their fiduciary duty can be fined and receive jail sentences.
Establish internal accounting controls. Firms must establish internal accounting control systems to protect the integrity of the accounting systems and safeguard the firms’ assets. The internal controls are intended to improve the reliability of accounting data and the quality of financial reports and to reduce the likelihood that individuals within the firm engage in accounting fraud.
Establish compliance programs. Firms must establish corporate compliance programs that ensure that they comply with important federal and state regulations. For example, a compliance program would document whether a firm’s truck drivers complied with all federal and state truck and driver safety regulations, such as the number of hours one can drive during the day and the gross highway weight of the truck.
Establish an ethics program. Firms must establish ethics programs that monitor the conduct of employees and executives. Among other features, these programs must include a whistleblower protection provision. The intent is to create an ethical work environment so that employees will know what is expected of them in their relationships with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders.
Expand the audit committee’s oversight powers. The external auditor, the internal auditor, and the compliance and ethics director owe their ultimate legal responsibilities to the audit committee, not to the firm. In addition, the audit committee has the unconditional power to probe and question any person in the firm, including the CEO, regarding any matter that might materially impact the firm or its financial statements.
Exhibit 1.6 summarizes some of the regulatory requirements that are designed to reduce agency costs.

A noticeable shift has occurred in the behavior of board members and management since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed. Boards appear much more serious about monitoring firms’ performance and ratifying important decisions by management. Audit committees, with their new independence and investigative powers, are providing greater oversight over the preparation of financial statements. Stronger internal accounting control systems, compliance programs, and ethics programs are improving the integrity of accounting systems and reducing the likelihood of fraud and other illegal activities. Thus, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act does appear to be having an effect. The major complaint from business has been the cost of compliance.

EXHIBIT 1.6 Corporate Governance Regulations Designed to Reduce Agency Costs

These are regulatory requirements that are designed to reduce agency costs. The most important requirements resulted from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed by Congress in 2002. The act was aimed at reducing agency costs, promoting ethical conduct, and improving the integrity of accounting reporting systems.

More recently, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 introduced a number of other requirements for public companies. Two that have received a great deal of attention relate to executive compensation. The first requires that companies allow stockholders a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation policies—the so-called “say-on-pay” rule. The aim of say-on-pay is to provide shareholders with a way to send a message to the company if there are concerns about the firm’s compensation practices. The second requirement is that all companies adopt “clawback” policies to recover compensation from executives if compensation is paid based on financial statements that later have to be “materially restated.” The goal of clawbacks is to discourage executives from misreporting the firm’s accounting numbers in order to increase their pay, as any compensation they earn as a result would ultimately be “clawed back” from them.

1.6 The Importance of Ethics in Business
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain why ethics is an important topic in the study of corporate finance.
We have just seen that Congress included ethics program requirements in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Why are ethics important to business?

Business Ethics
The term ethics describes a society’s ideas about what actions are right and wrong. Ethical values are not moral absolutes, and they can and do vary across societies. Regardless of cultural differences, however, if we think about it, all of us would probably prefer to live in a world where people behave ethically—where people try to do what is right.

In our society, ethical rules include considering the impact of our actions on others, being willing to sometimes put the interests of others ahead of our own interests, and realizing that we must follow the same rules we expect others to follow. The golden rule—“Do unto others as you would have done unto you”—is an example of a widely accepted ethical norm.8

Are Business Ethics Different from Everyday Ethics?
Perhaps business is a dog-eat-dog world where ethics do not matter. People who take this point of view link business ethics to the ethics of the poker game and not to the ethics of everyday morality. Poker players, they suggest, must practice cunning deception and must conceal their strengths and their intentions. After all, they are playing the game to win. How far does one go to win?

In 2002, investors learned the hard way about a number of firms that had been behaving according to the ethics of the poker game: Cunning deception and concealment of information were the order of the day at WorldCom, Enron, Global Crossing, Tyco, and a host of other firms. The market’s reaction to the behavior of these firms was to wipe out $2.3 trillion of stockholder value. More recently, in 2016, it was revealed that Wells Fargo employees had opened millions of unauthorized checking and credit card accounts for the bank’s customers. Wells Fargo dismissed more than 5,300 low-level employees and was fined $185 million; the value of the firm’s equity dropped $28 billion as this scandal developed.

We believe that those who argue that ethics do not matter in business are mistaken. Indeed, most academic studies on the topic suggest that traditions of morality are very relevant to business and to financial markets in particular. The reasons are practical as well as ethical. Corruption in business creates inefficiencies in an economy, inhibits the growth of capital markets, and slows a country’s rate of economic growth.

For example, as Russia made the transition to a market economy, it had a difficult time establishing a stock market and attracting foreign investment. The reason was a simple one. Corruption was rampant in local government and in business. Contractual agreements were not enforceable, and there was no reliable financial information about Russian companies. Not until the mid-1990s did some Russian companies begin to display enough financial transparency to attract investment capital.9

Types of Ethical Conflicts in Business
We turn next to a consideration of the ethical problems that arise in business dealings. Most problems involve three related areas: agency costs, conflicts of interest, and informational asymmetry.

Agency Costs

As we discussed earlier in this chapter, many relationships in business are agency relationships. Agents can be bound both legally and ethically to act in the interest of the principal. Financial managers have agency obligations to act honestly and to see that subordinates act honestly with respect to financial transactions. A product recall or environmental offense may cause a decline in a firm’s stock price. However, revelations of dishonesty, deception, and fraud in financial matters can have a larger and longer-lasting impact on the stock price. If the dishonesty is flagrant, the firm may go bankrupt, as we saw with the bankruptcies of Enron and WorldCom.

Conflicts of Interest

Conflicts of interest often arise in agency relationships. A conflict of interest in such a situation can arise when the agent’s interests are different from those of the principal. For example, suppose you’re interested in buying a house and a local real estate agent is helping you find the home of your dreams. As it turns out, the dream house is one for which your agent is also the listing agent. Your agent has a conflict of interest because her professional obligation to help you find the right house at a fair price conflicts with her professional obligation to get the highest price possible for the client whose house she has listed.

Organizations can be either principals or agents and, hence, can be parties to conflicts of interest. In the past, for example, many large accounting firms provided both consulting services and audits for corporations. This dual function may compromise the independence and objectivity of the audit opinion, even though the work is done by different parts of the firm. For example, if consulting fees from an audit client become a large source of income, the auditing firm may be less likely to render an adverse audit opinion and thereby risk losing the consulting business.

Conflicts of interest are typically resolved in one of two ways. Sometimes complete disclosure is sufficient. Thus, in real estate transactions, it is not unusual for the same lawyer or realtor to represent both the buyer and the seller. This practice is not considered unethical as long as both sides are aware of the fact and give their consent. Alternatively, the conflicted party can withdraw from serving the interests of one of the parties. Sometimes the law mandates this solution. For example, public accounting firms are not permitted to provide certain types of consulting services to their audit clients.

Information Asymmetry

Information asymmetry exists when one party in a business transaction has information that is unavailable to the other parties in the transaction. The existence of information asymmetry in business relationships is commonplace. For example, suppose you decide to sell your 10-year-old car. You know much more about the real condition of the car than does the prospective buyer. The ethical issue is this: How much should you tell the prospective buyer? In other words, to what extent is the party with the information advantage obligated to reduce the amount of information asymmetry?

information asymmetry the situation in which one party in a business transaction has information that is unavailable to the other parties in the transaction

Society imposes both market-based and legal solutions for transactional information asymmetries. Consider the prospective car buyer in the previous example. You can be reasonably sure that the buyer understands that he or she has less information about the car’s condition than the seller and, as a result, will pay a lower price for the vehicle. Conversely, sellers who certify or provide a warranty with respect to the condition of the vehicle reduce the concerns that buyers have about information asymmetries and therefore tend to receive higher prices.

Legal solutions often require sellers to disclose material facts to buyers or prohibit trading on information that is not widely available. For example, when you sell a car, you are required to disclose to the seller whether it has been in an accident and whether the odometer has been altered. Similarly, in many states home sellers must disclose if they are aware of any major defects in their home. In the investment world, the trading of stocks based on material inside information (e.g., information that is not available to the public) has been made illegal in an effort to create a “level playing field” for all investors.

The Importance of an Ethical Business Culture
Some economists have noted that the legal system and market forces impose substantial costs on individuals and institutions that engage in unethical behavior. As a result, these forces provide important incentives that foster ethical behavior in the business community. The incentives include financial losses, legal fines, jail time, and bankruptcy. Ethicists argue, however, that laws and market forces are not enough. For example, the financial sector is one of the most heavily regulated areas of the U.S. economy. Yet despite heavy regulation, the sector has a long and rich history of financial scandals.

In addition to laws and market forces, many people argue that it is important to create an ethical culture in the firm. Why is this important? An ethical business culture means that people have a set of principles—a moral compass, so to speak—that helps them identify moral issues and make ethical judgments without being told what to do. The culture has a powerful influence on the way people behave and the way they make decisions.

The people at the top of a company determine whether or not the culture of that company is ethical. At Wells Fargo, for example, top officers promoted a culture of aggressive sales of its products to customers in order to increase fees, and a willingness, at times, to cross over ethical and even legal lines. The motto “Do no evil” was adopted by Google’s founders before they took the firm public in 2004.

More than likely, you will be confronted with ethical issues during your professional career. Knowing how to identify and deal with ethical issues is an important part of your professional skill set. Exhibit 1.7 presents a framework for making ethical judgments.

Serious Consequences
In recent years the rules have changed, and the cost of ethical mistakes can be extremely high. In the past, the business community and legal authorities often dismissed corporate scandals as a “few rotten apples” in an otherwise sound barrel. This is no longer true today. In 2005, for instance, Bernard J. Ebbers, the 63-year-old CEO of WorldCom, was found guilty of fraud and theft and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Judge Barbara S. Jones, acknowledging that Ebbers would probably serve the rest of his days in jail, said, “I find a sentence of anything less would not reflect the seriousness of the crime.” In the past, sentences for white-collar crimes were minimal; even for serious crimes, there often was no jail time at all. Clearly, business ethics is a topic of high interest and increasing importance in the business community and one that will be discussed throughout this book.

EXHIBIT 1.7 A Framework for the Analysis of Ethical Conflicts

Dealing with ethical conflicts is an inescapable part of professional life for most people. An analytical framework can be helpful in understanding and resolving such conflicts.
The first step toward ethical behavior is to recognize that you face a moral issue. In general, if your actions or decisions will cause harm to others, you are facing a moral issue. When you find yourself in this position, you might ask yourself the following questions:

What does the law require? When in doubt, consult the legal department.
What do your role-related obligations require? What is your station, and what are its duties? If you are a member of a profession, what does the code of conduct of your profession say you should do in these circumstances?
Are you an agent employed on behalf of another in these circumstances? If so, what are the interests and desires of the employing party?
Are the interests of the stockholders materially affected? Your obligation is to represent the best interests of the firm’s owners.
Do you have a conflict of interest? Will full diclosure of the conflict be sufficient? If not, you must determine what interest has priority.
Are you abusing an information asymmetry? Is your use of the information asymmetry fair? It probably is fair if you would make the same decision if the roles of the parties were reversed or if you would publicly advocate the principle behind your decision.
Would you be willing to have your action and all the reasons that motivated it reported in the Wall Street Journal?

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Identify the key financial decisions facing the financial manager of any business.

The financial manager faces three basic decisions: (1) which productive assets the firm should buy (capital budgeting decisions), (2) how the firm should finance the productive assets purchased (financing decisions), and (3) how the firm should manage its day-to-day financial activities (working capital decisions). The financial manager should make these decisions in a way that maximizes the current value of the firm’s stock.

2 Identify common forms of business organization in the United States and their respective strengths and weaknesses.

Businesses in the United States are commonly organized as a sole proprietorship, a general or limited partnership, a corporation, or a limited liability partnership or company. Most large firms elect to organize as C-corporations because of the ease of raising money; the major disadvantage is double taxation. Smaller companies tend to organize as sole proprietorships or partnerships. The advantages of these forms of organization include ease of formation and taxation at the personal income tax rate. The major disadvantage is the owners’ unlimited personal liability. Limited liability partnerships and companies and S-corporations provide owners of small businesses who make the business decisions with limited personal liability.

3 Describe the typical organization of the financial function in a large corporation.

In a large corporation, the financial manager generally has the rank of vice president and goes by the title of chief financial officer. The CFO reports directly to the firm’s CEO. Positions reporting directly to the CFO generally include the treasurer, the risk manager, the controller, and the internal auditor. The audit committee of the board of directors is also important in the financial function. The committee hires the external auditor for the firm, and the internal auditor, external auditor, and compliance and ethics director all report to the audit committee.

4 Explain why maximizing the value of the firm’s stock is the appropriate goal for management.

Maximizing the firm’s stock value is an appropriate goal because it forces management to focus on decisions that will generate the greatest amount of wealth for stockholders. Since the value of a share of stock (or any asset) is determined by its cash flows, management’s decisions must consider the size of the cash flow (larger is better), the timing of the cash flow (sooner is better), and the riskiness of the cash flow (given equal returns, lower risk is better). In maximizing the value of the owner’s equity, managers must make decisions that account for the interests of all stakeholders.

5 Discuss how agency conflicts affect the goal of maximizing stockholder value.

In most large corporations, there is a significant degree of separation between management and ownership. As a result, stockholders have little control over corporate managers, and management may thus be tempted to pursue its own self-interest rather than maximizing the value of the owners’ stock. The resulting conflicts give rise to agency costs. Ways of reducing agency costs include developing compensation agreements that link employee compensation to the firm’s performance and having independent boards of directors monitor management.

6 Explain why ethics is an important topic in the study of corporate finance.

If we lived in a world without ethical norms, we would soon discover that it would be difficult to do business. As a practical matter, the law and market forces provide important incentives that foster ethical behavior in the business community, but they are not enough to ensure ethical behavior. An ethical culture is also needed. In an ethical culture, people have a set of moral principles—a moral compass—that helps them identify ethical issues and make ethical judgments without being told what to do.

Ethics Case
Incentives and Ethics: Cross-Selling at Wells Fargo

In September 2016, news broke of Wells Fargo’s $185 million settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Los Angeles City Attorney, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The penalties were assessed after investigations revealed that, over the course of five years, Wells Fargo employees had opened more than two million bank or credit card accounts without customers’ knowledge or permission. As a result, Wells Fargo fired more than 5,300 employees. In addition, the firm’s board chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), John Stumpf, was required to give up more than $69 million of compensation and retired shortly after the settlement was announced.

How did such a massive fraud happen for such a long period without being discovered? At its heart, it appeared that the bank was on a strong trajectory of solid growth, which was built on the notion of cross-selling its various financial products. However, as we will see, this turned out to be problematic.

Cross-Selling: Eight Is Great!

Wells Fargo bank employees were encouraged to “cross-sell” products to customers. That is, someone who had a checking account could also be offered overdraft protection, a savings account, a credit card, a home equity loan, wealth management services, or other financial products that would generate additional fees for the bank. The idea behind cross-selling is that it is less costly to sell a new product to an existing customer than to a new customer. Thus, cross-selling to current customers increases fee income for the bank while keeping costs down, resulting in higher profits.

In the 2010 Wells Fargo Annual Report, John Stumpf was quoted as saying “I’m often asked why we set a cross-sell goal of eight. The answer is, it rhymed with ‘great.’ Perhaps our new cheer should be: ‘Let’s go again, for ten!’” By 2015, the firm’s retail banking cross-sell was 6.11 products per household, but the message to employees was clear: “Eight is great,” and selling more products to current customers was a key focus in the firm’s Community Banking division.

Is Eight That Great?

As a business strategy, cross-selling is a perfectly reasonable practice. And while it certainly added to Wells Fargo’s growth and the bottom line, signs of potential problems came to light in a Los Angeles Times story that ran in late 2013.1 The article outlined a laser focus on increased sales, with employees being assigned daily targets for signing up customers for additional products. Not only was employee compensation tied to the number of new accounts opened, but at least some employees were told that if they did not meet their daily targets, they would have to work evenings and weekends to do so. Some employees even said that they were threatened with being fired if they failed to make their sales goals. The LA Times article suggested that the bank had a “pressure cooker sales culture” and reported that branch managers were asked not just to meet but to exceed daily quotas handed down from the regional head office. When commenting on the regional managers’ daily conference calls to review sales progress, one former branch manager said, “If you do not make your goal, you are severely chastised and embarrassed in front of 60-plus managers in your area by the Community Banking president.”

News of potential problems in the LA area first came to light after about 30 Wells Fargo employees were fired for opening accounts that had never been used and for manipulating customer approval surveys. The newspaper also quoted a senior spokesman for the region as saying that “We found a breakdown in a small number of our team members.”2 As it turned out, the problems were considerably larger than this quote would suggest. In fact, because of the newspaper reporting, the Los Angeles city attorney initiated an investigation that ultimately led the city to sue Wells Fargo over the opening of unauthorized accounts.3 Other authorities, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, also started to scrutinize the bank’s activities.

The subsequent investigations discovered that employees had opened additional accounts without customer permission, transferred funds to those accounts without customers’ knowledge or consent, ordered new credit cards without customer approval, issued and activated debit cards without authorization, created fake email addresses to enroll customers in online banking, and in some cases allegedly forged customer signatures in order to open new accounts. Many customers were charged for insufficient funds or overdraft fees because the money was not in their original accounts, and credit card customers were charged annual fees, finance or interest charges, and other fees. But perhaps just as important, their trust in the company they had asked to look after their finances had been betrayed.

The Fallout

While the $185 million fine was small relative to Wells Fargo’s 2016 revenues of $94 billion and profits of $23 billion, in the weeks following the announcement of the settlement, the bank’s stock price declined from $49.90 (on September 8) to $44.28 by month-end—a drop of about 11 percent. And since that time, the firm has repeatedly been the focus of negative headlines in the business press. Other investigations have ensued. Board chairman and CEO John Stumpf was called to testify before the Senate Banking Committee, where he was grilled over the bank’s practices. Senator Elizabeth Warren told Stumpf, “You should resign . . . and you should be criminally investigated.” In the committee hearings, Stumpf was also asked if the firm’s board of directors would try to “claw back” any compensation paid to senior executives who were associated with the fraud. This was, perhaps, in part because Carrie Tolstedt (the head of the Community Banking division where the problems occurred) would leave the firm with an exit package worth an estimated $125 million. Stumpf’s response was, “I am not part of that process. I want to make sure nothing I say will prejudice their process.”4 Of course, the implication was that he too should be financially penalized.

When it comes to recovering payments from executives in cases of fraud or financial irregularities, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has the regulatory authority to “claw back” payments to senior executives, but only if there is a “material misstatement” of a firm’s financials. The problems at Wells Fargo, however, did not rise to this level. At the same time, Wells Fargo had its own clawback policy that allowed the board to recover compensation from executives if their actions caused “reputational harm” to the company. But only after external pressure mounted to a crescendo did the board act to claw back compensation. Intially, the company announced that Tolstedt would not receive a bonus or severance, and would forfeit $19 million worth of unvested stock awards. She also agreed not to exercise around $34 million in stock options. Similarly, John Stumpf would forgo most of his 2016 salary, would receive no bonus for 2016, and would give up some $41 million in stock awards. The firm later announced it would claw back an additional $47 million from Tolstedt and another $28 million from Stumpf. Stumpf decided to retire around this time. This was a dramatic fall from grace for someone who had been named as CEO of the year by Morningstar the prior year.

The fallout at Wells Fargo continues, with ongoing investigations by the company and regulators, several senior bank executives (including the regional heads of Los Angeles and Arizona) being dismissed, and lawsuits being filed by customers, former employees, and shareholders. At the same time, as part of the settlement agreement, the company has agreed to overhaul its sales practices, removing product sales goals, untying employee compensation from the number of new accounts opened, and basing pay more on branch-level as opposed to individual performance. Will these changes fix the problems? Only time will tell. What we do know is that Wells Fargo has experienced double-digit declines in new checking accounts and credit card applications every month since the settlement.

Discussion Questions
Should employee pay be linked to sales targets?
Should the practice of cross-selling be eliminated?
What other steps could Wells Fargo have taken ahead of time to avoid the problems that it faced?
Should senior executives Carrie Tolstedt and John Stumpf have been financially penalized by the company?
How important is it to have regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission or Congress involved in the oversight of situations such as that at Wells Fargo?

4 A favorite premeal “quaffing” champagne of young investment bankers on Wall Street is Dom Perignon, known as the “Domer,” which, depending on the vintage, can cost as much as $700 a bottle. Senior partners who are more genteel are reported to favor a 1953 Margaux, a French Bordeaux wine from Château Margaux; 1953 is considered a stellar vintage year, and Margaux 1953 is an excellent but very pricey choice (about $2,500 per bottle in 2020).

CHAPTER 2
The Financial System and the Level of Interest Rates
CHAPTER 2
The Financial System and the Level of Interest Rates

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Describe the role of the financial system in the economy and the two basic ways in which money flows through the system.
Discuss direct financing and the important role that investment banks play in this process.
Describe the primary, secondary, and money markets, explaining the special importance of secondary and money markets to business organizations.
Explain what an efficient market is and why market efficiency is important to financial managers.
Explain how financial institutions serve the needs of consumers and small businesses.
Compute the nominal and the real rates of interest, differentiating between them.
One of the most important institutional players in the financial system is the Federal Reserve System (called the Fed). In fact, it is sometimes said that the chairperson of the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors, currently Jerome Powell, is the second most powerful person in the United States—second only to the president. Where does all of this power come from?

It comes from the Fed’s role as the nation’s central bank—the institution that controls the money supply. The Fed manages a key component of the nation’s economy by conducting monetary policy, which affects how much money is available in the economy. One way it does this is by setting a target short-term interest rate at which large money center banks lend to each other (called the federal funds rate) and by buying and selling Treasury and federal agency securities to achieve this rate. Increases in the money supply put downward pressure on short-term interest rates. Over time, this can lead to increases in the level of economic activity, along with higher inflation. Conversely, decreases in the money supply put upward pressure on short-term interest rates. This can lead to a lower level of economic activity and lower inflation.

Small wonder that when the Fed speaks, everyone stops and listens. Ben Bernanke, the chairperson of the Fed Board of Governors from 2006 to 2014, described the effects of Fed announcements on the stock market as follows:

Normally, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve, announces its interest rate decisions at around 2:15 P.M. following each of its eight regularly scheduled meetings each year. An air of expectation reigns in financial markets in the few minutes before the announcement. If you happen to have access to a monitor that tracks key market indexes, at 2:15 P.M. on an announcement day you can watch those indexes quiver as if trying to digest the information in the rate decision and the FOMC’s accompanying statement of explanation. Then the black line representing each market index moves quickly up or down, and the markets have priced the FOMC action into the aggregate values of U.S. equities, bonds, and other assets.1

The Fed’s policy actions are transmitted quickly through the financial system and ultimately affect the economic well-being of nearly all consumers and businesses. This chapter provides a basic explanation of how the financial system works and discusses interest rates and their movements.

Chapter Preview
Chapter 1 identified three kinds of decisions that financial managers make: capital budgeting decisions, which concern the purchase of productive assets; financing decisions, which concern how assets will be financed or paid for; and working capital management decisions, which concern day-to-day financial matters. In making capital budgeting decisions, financial managers should select projects whose cash flows increase the value of the firm’s stock. The financial models used to evaluate these projects require an understanding of the concepts covered in this chapter. In making financing decisions, financial managers want to obtain capital at the lowest possible cost, which means that they need to understand how financial markets work and what financing alternatives are available. Finally, working capital management is concerned with whether a firm has enough money to pay its bills and how it invests its spare cash to earn interest. Making decisions in these areas requires knowledge of the financial system and what determines the level of interest rates.

This chapter provides an overview of key concepts related to the financial system, many of which we will revisit in later chapters. We begin the chapter by looking at how the financial system facilitates the transfer of money from those who have it to those who need it. Then we describe direct financing, through which businesses finance themselves by issuing debt and equity, and the important role that investment banks play in the process. Next we describe different types of financial markets that are in the financial system and discuss the concept of market efficiency. We then examine indirect financing and the services that financial institutions provide to large and small businesses. Finally, we discuss the factors that determine the general level of interest rates in the economy and explain how interest rates vary over the business cycle.

2.1 The Financial System
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the role of the financial system in the economy and the two basic ways in which money flows through the system.
The financial system consists of financial markets and financial institutions. Financial market is a general term that includes a number of different types of markets for the creation and exchange of financial assets, such as stocks and bonds. Financial institutions are firms such as commercial banks, credit unions, insurance companies, pension funds, and finance companies that provide financial services to the economy. The distinguishing feature of financial institutions is that they invest their funds in financial assets, such as business loans, stocks, and bonds, rather than real assets, such as plant and equipment.

financial assets assets that are claims on the cash flows from other assets; business loans, stocks, and bonds are financial assets

real assets nonfinancial assets such as plant and equipment; productive assets are real assets; many financial assets are claims on cash flows from real assets

The critical role of the financial system in the economy is to gather money from households (individuals), businesses, and governments with surplus funds to invest and channel that money to those who need it. Businesses need money to invest in new productive assets to expand their operations and increase the firm’s cash flow, which should increase the value of the firm. Consumers, too, need money, which they use to purchase things such as homes, cars, and boats—or to pay college tuition bills. Some of the institutions in the financial system are well-known names such as the New York Stock Exchange, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and State Farm Insurance. Others are lesser-known but important firms, such as the multinational giant AIG.

A well-developed financial system is critical for the operation of a complex industrial economy such as that of the United States. Highly industrialized countries cannot function without a competitive and sound financial system that efficiently gathers money from savers and investors and channels it into the best investment opportunities. Let’s look at a simple example to illustrate how the financial system channels money to businesses.

The Financial System at Work
Suppose that, at the beginning of the school year, you receive a $10,000 student loan to help pay your expenses for the year, but you need only $5,000 for the first semester. You wisely decide to invest the remaining $5,000 to earn some interest income. After shopping at several banks near campus, you decide that the best deal is a $5,000 consumer certificate of deposit (CD) that matures in three months and pays 2 percent interest. (CDs are debt instruments issued by a bank that pay interest and are insured by the federal government.)

The bank pools your money with funds from checking and savings accounts and other CDs and uses this money to make business and consumer loans. In this case, the bank makes a loan to the pizza parlor near campus: $30,000 for five years at a 7 percent interest rate. The bank decides to make the loan because the owner of the pizza parlor has a sound credit rating and because it expects the pizza parlor to generate enough cash flows to repay the loan with interest. The pizza parlor owner wants the money to invest in additional real (productive) assets to earn greater profits (cash flows) and thereby increase the value of her business. During the same week, the bank makes loans to other businesses and also rejects a number of loan requests because the borrowers have poor credit or the proposed projects have low rates of return.

From this example, we can draw some important inferences about financial systems:

If the financial system is competitive, the interest rate the bank pays on CDs will be at or near the highest rate that you can earn on a CD of similar maturity and risk at another bank. At the same time, the pizza parlor and other businesses will have borrowed at or near the lowest possible interest cost, given their risk. Competition among banks will drive CD rates up and loan rates down.
The bank gathers money from you and other consumers in small dollar amounts, aggregates it, and then makes loans in much larger dollar amounts. Saving by consumers in small dollar amounts is the origin of much of the money that funds business loans.
An important function of the financial system is to direct money to the best investment opportunities in the economy. If the financial system works properly, only business projects with high rates of return and borrowers with good credit will be financed. Those with low rates of return or poor credit will be rejected. Thus, financial systems contribute to higher production and efficiency in the overall economy.
Finally, note that the bank has earned a tidy profit from the deal. The bank has borrowed your money at 2 percent by selling you a CD and has lent the money to the pizza parlor at 7 percent. Thus, the bank’s gross profit is 5 percent (7 percent − 2 percent = 5 percent), which is the difference between the bank’s lending and borrowing rates. Banks earn much of their profits from this spread between the lending and borrowing rates.
EXHIBIT 2.1 The Flow of Funds through the Financial System The role of the financial system is to gather money from households, businesses, or governments with surplus funds and channel it to those who need it. Money flows through the financial system in two basic ways: directly, through wholesale financial markets, as shown in the top route of the diagram, and indirectly, through financial institutions, as shown in the bottom route.


How Funds Flow through the Financial System
We have seen that the financial system plays a critical role in the economy. The system moves money from lender-savers (whose income exceeds their spending) to borrower-spenders (whose spending exceeds their income), as shown schematically in Exhibit 2.1. The most important group of lender-savers in the economy are households, but some businesses and many state and local governments at times have excess funds to lend to those who need money. As a group, businesses are the borrower-spenders that borrow the most in the economy, followed by the federal government.

The arrows in Exhibit 2.1 show that there are two basic mechanisms by which funds flow through the financial system: (1) Funds can flow directly through financial markets (the route at the top of the diagram) and (2) funds can flow indirectly through financial institutions (the route at the bottom of the diagram). In the next three sections, we look more closely at the direct flow of funds and at the financial markets. After that, we discuss financial institutions and the indirect flow of funds.

2.2 Direct Financing
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss direct financing and the important role that investment banks play in this process.
In this section we turn our attention to direct financing, in which funds flow directly through the financial system. In direct transactions, the lender-savers and the borrower-spenders deal directly with one another; borrower-spenders sell securities, such as stocks and bonds, to lender-savers in exchange for money. These securities represent claims on the borrowers’ future income or assets. A number of different interchangeable terms are used to refer to securities, including financial securities, financial instruments, and financial claims.

The financial markets in which direct transactions take place are wholesale markets with a typical minimum transaction size of $1 million. For most business firms, these markets provide funds at the lowest possible cost. The major buyers and sellers of securities in the direct financial markets are commercial banks; other financial institutions, such as insurance companies and business finance companies; large corporations; federal, state, and local governments; hedge funds; and some wealthy individuals. It is important to note that financial institutions are major buyers of securities in the direct financial markets. For example, life and casualty insurance companies buy large quantities of corporate bonds and stocks for their investment portfolios. In Exhibit 2.1 the arrow leading from financial institutions to financial markets depicts this flow.

Although few individuals participate in direct financial markets, individuals can gain access to many of the financial products produced in these markets through retail channels at investment or commercial banks or independent brokerage firms (the lower route in Exhibit 2.1). For example, individuals can buy or sell stocks and bonds in small dollar amounts at Merrill Lynch, a Bank of America retail brokerage business, or the discount brokerage firm TD Ameritrade. We discuss indirect financing through financial institutions later in this chapter.

A Direct Market Transaction
Let’s look at a typical direct market transaction. When managers decide to engage in a direct market transaction, they often have in mind a specific capital project that needs financing, such as building a new manufacturing facility. Suppose that Apple Inc. needs $200 million to build a new facility and decides to fund it by selling long-term bonds with a 15-year maturity (Apple is planning on borrowing the money). While searching for the financing, Apple contacts a group of insurance companies, which expresses an interest in buying Apple’s bonds. The insurance companies will buy Apple’s bonds only after determining that they are priced fairly for their level of risk. Apple will sell its bonds to the insurance companies only after shopping the market to be sure these investors are offering a competitive price.

If Apple and the insurance companies strike a deal, the flow of funds between them will be as shown below:


Apple sells its bonds to the insurance group for $200 million and gets the use of the money for 15 years. For Apple, the bonds are a debt liability, and it pays the insurance companies (bondholders) interest for use of the money. For the insurance companies, the bonds are an asset that earns interest.

Investment Banks and Direct Financing
Two important participants in the direct financial markets are investment banks and money center banks. Investment banks specialize in helping companies sell new debt or equity, although they can also provide other services, such as the broker and dealer services discussed later in this chapter and traditional banking services. Money center banks are large commercial banks that provide both traditional and investment banking services throughout the world.

investment banks firms that specialize in helping companies sell new security issues

money center banks large commercial banks that provide both traditional and investment banking services throughout the world

Historically, there was a clear distinction between the activities of investment and money center banks. After the Great Depression (1929–1933), commercial banks were prohibited from engaging in investment banking activities because it was believed that these activities encouraged them to take too many risks. However, this prohibition ended in 1999 with passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act, after which the major money center banks, such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup, started providing investment banking services. After the financial meltdown in 2008, the remaining major independent investment banks, specifically Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, converted themselves into traditional bank holding companies to qualify for government assistance. While there are still small investment banks that focus only on investment banking activities, the large investment and commercial banks are now quite similar.

Origination

Origination is the process of preparing a security issue for sale. During the origination phase, the investment banker may help the client company determine the feasibility of the project being funded and the amount and type of capital that needs to be raised. Once this is done, the investment banker helps secure a credit rating, if needed, determines the sale date, obtains legal clearances to sell the securities, and gets the securities printed. If securities are to be sold in the public markets, the issuer must also file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Issuers that sell securities in the private markets are not required to file a registration statement with the SEC.

Underwriting

Underwriting is the process by which an investment banker helps the company sell its new security issue. In the most common type of underwriting arrangement, called firm-commitment underwriting, the investment banker buys the new securities from the issuing company and resells them to investors. Because the investment banker buys the entire security issue from the company at a fixed price, the issuing company is guaranteed that price. On the other hand, the investment banker takes the risk that the actual price at which the securities are sold is less than the price that is paid to the company. Since issuing companies typically need a certain amount of money to pay for a particular project or to fund operations, and getting anything less than this amount can pose a serious problem, financial managers almost always prefer to have their new security issues underwritten on a firm-commitment basis.2

Once the investment bankers buy the securities from the issuer, they immediately offer to resell individual securities to institutional investors and the public at a specified offering price. The underwriters hope to be able to sell the offering at the market-clearing price, which is the price that will allow the entire security issue to be sold during the first day of sale. Underwriting involves considerable risk because it is difficult to estimate the price that will clear the market. If the investment bank has to sell the securities at a price below the price that it paid to the issuing company, the investment bank suffers a financial loss.

The investment banker’s compensation is called the underwriting spread. It is the difference between the offering price and the price the investment banker pays for the security issue. The underwriting spread is one of the costs to the firm of selling new securities.

Learning by Doing Application 2.1 illustrates how the underwriting spread is calculated.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 2.1
Underwriter’s Compensation

Problem

Dairy Queen needs to raise $5 million to build three new restaurants, and its financial manager decides to issue long-term bonds. The financial manager hires an investment banking firm to help design the bond issue and underwrite it. The issue consists of 5,000 bonds, and the investment banker agrees to purchase the entire issue for $4.8 million. The investment banker then resells the bonds to investors at the offering price. The sale totals $5.0 million. What is the underwriter’s compensation?





Distribution

Distribution is the process of marketing and reselling the securities to investors. Because security prices can take large, unexpected swings, a quick resale of all the securities is important. To that end, the underwriters often form sales syndicates, consisting of a number of different investment banking firms, to sell the securities. If the securities are not sold within a few days, the syndicate is disbanded, and the individual syndicate members sell the unsold securities at whatever price they can get.

2.3 Types of Financial Markets
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the primary, secondary, and money markets, explaining the special importance of secondary and money markets to business organizations.
We have seen that direct flows of funds occur in financial markets. However, as already mentioned, financial market is a very general term. A complex industrial economy such as ours includes many different types of financial markets, and not all of them are involved in direct financing. Next, we examine some of the more important ways to classify financial markets. Note that these classifications overlap to a large extent. Thus, for example, the New York Stock Exchange fits into several different categories.

Primary and Secondary Markets
A primary market is any market where companies sell new security issues (debt or equity). For example, suppose Hewlett-Packard (HP) needs to raise $100 million for business expansion and decides to raise the money through the sale of common stock. The company will sell the new equity issue in the primary market for corporate stock—probably with the help of an underwriter, as discussed in Section 2.2. The primary markets are not well known to the general public because they are wholesale markets and the sales take place outside of the public view. A key characteristic of a primary market is that the transaction results in new money going into the firm.

primary market a financial market in which new security issues are sold by companies directly to investors

A secondary market is any market where owners of outstanding securities can sell them to other investors. Secondary markets are like used-car markets in that they allow investors to buy or sell previously owned securities for cash. These markets are important because they enable investors to buy and sell securities as frequently as they want. As you might expect, investors are willing to pay higher prices for securities that have active secondary markets. Secondary markets are important to corporations as well because investors are willing to pay higher prices for securities in primary markets if the securities have active secondary markets. Thus, companies whose securities have active secondary markets enjoy lower funding costs than similar firms whose securities do not have active secondary markets. In contrast to primary markets, no new money goes into the firm when a secondary market transaction takes place.

secondary market a financial market in which the owners of outstanding securities can sell them to other investors

Marketability versus Liquidity

An important characteristic of a security to investors is its marketability. Marketability is the ease with which a security can be sold and converted into cash. A security’s marketability depends in part on the costs of trading and searching for information, so-called transaction costs. The lower the transaction costs, the greater a security’s marketability. Because secondary markets make it easier to trade securities, their presence increases a security’s marketability.

marketability the ease with which a security can be sold and converted into cash

A term closely related to marketability is liquidity. Liquidity is the ability to convert an asset into cash quickly without loss of value. In common use, the terms marketability and liquidity are often used interchangeably, but they are different. Liquidity implies that when the security is sold, its value will be preserved; marketability does not carry this implication.

liquidity the ability to convert an asset into cash quickly without loss of value

Brokers versus Dealers

Two types of market specialists facilitate transactions in secondary markets. Brokers are market specialists who bring buyers and sellers together when a sale takes place. They execute the transaction for their client and are compensated for their services with a commission fee. They bear no risk of ownership of the securities during the transaction; their only service is that of matchmaker.

brokers market specialists who bring buyers and sellers together, usually for a commission

Dealers, in contrast, make markets for securities and do bear risk. They make a market for a security by buying and selling from an inventory of securities they own. Dealers make their profit, just as retail merchants do, by selling securities at prices above what they paid for them. The risk that dealers bear is price risk, which is the risk that they will sell a security for less than they paid for it.

dealers market specialists who make markets for securities by buying and selling from their own inventories

Exchanges and Over-the-Counter Markets
Financial markets can be classified as either organized markets (more commonly called exchanges) or over-the-counter markets. Traditional exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), provide a physical meeting place and communication facilities for members to buy and sell securities or other assets (such as commodities like oil or wheat) under a specific set of rules and regulations. Members are individuals who represent securities firms as well as people who trade for their own accounts. Only members can use the exchange.

Securities not listed on an exchange are bought and sold in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. The OTC market differs from organized exchanges in that the OTC market has no central trading location. Instead, investors can execute OTC transactions by visiting or telephoning an OTC dealer or by using a computer-based electronic trading system linked to the OTC dealer. Historically, stocks traded over the counter were those of small and relatively unknown firms, most of which would not qualify to be listed on a major exchange. However, electronic trading has become much more important as trading technologies have advanced. Many large, well-known firms, such as Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Facebook, and Microsoft, have securities that now trade on electronic exchanges such as NASDAQ. In fact, even in organized markets like the NYSE, most trades are now completed electronically.

Money and Capital Markets
Money markets are global markets where short-term debt instruments, which have maturities of less than one year, are traded. Money markets are wholesale markets in which the minimum transaction is $1 million and transactions of $10 million or $100 million are not uncommon. Money market instruments are lower in risk than other securities because of their high liquidity and low default risk. In fact, the term money market is used because these instruments are close substitutes for cash. The most important and largest money markets are in New York City, London, and Tokyo. Exhibit 2.2 lists the most common money market instruments and the dollar amounts outstanding as of December 2019.

money markets markets where short-term debt instruments are traded

Large companies use money markets to adjust their liquidity positions. Liquidity, as mentioned, is the ability to convert an asset into cash quickly without loss of value. Liquidity problems arise because companies’ cash receipts and expenditures are rarely perfectly synchronized. To manage liquidity, a firm can invest idle cash in money market instruments; then, if the firm has a temporary cash shortfall, it can raise cash overnight by selling money market instruments.

Recall from Chapter 1 that capital markets are markets where equity and debt instruments with maturities of greater than one year are traded. In these markets, large firms finance capital assets such as plants and equipment. The NYSE, as well as the London and Tokyo stock exchanges, are capital markets. Exhibit 2.2 also lists the major U.S. capital market instruments and the dollar amounts outstanding. Compared with money market instruments, capital market instruments are less marketable, have higher default risk, and have longer maturities.

EXHIBIT 2.2 Selected Money Market and Capital Market Instruments, December 2019 ($ billions)

The exhibit shows the size of the U.S. market for each of the most important money market and capital market instruments. Notice that the largest security market is the market for corporate stock, followed by those for mortgage debt, corporate bonds, and Treasury notes. Compared with money market instruments, capital market instruments are less marketable, have higher default risk, and have longer maturities.

Public and Private Markets
Public markets are organized financial markets where the general public buys and sells securities through their stockbrokers. The NYSE, for example, is a public market. The SEC regulates public securities markets in the United States. This agency is responsible for overseeing the securities industry and regulating all primary and secondary markets in which securities are traded. Many corporations want access to the public markets because they are wholesale markets where issuers can sell their securities at the lowest possible funding cost. The downside for corporations selling in the public markets is the cost of complying with the various SEC regulations.

In contrast to public markets, private markets involve direct transactions between two parties. Transactions in private markets are often called private placements. In private markets, a company contacts investors directly and negotiates a deal to sell them all or part of a security issue. Larger firms may be equipped to handle these transactions themselves. Smaller firms are more likely to use the services of an investment bank, which will help locate investors, help negotiate the deal, and handle the legal aspects of the transaction. The major advantages of a private placement are the speed at which funds can be raised and low transaction costs. The downsides are that privately placed securities cannot legally be sold in the public markets because they lack SEC registration and the dollar amounts that can be raised tend to be smaller.

private placements sales of unregistered securities and directly to investors, such as insurance companies wealthy individuals

Futures and Options Markets
Markets also exist for trading in futures and options. Perhaps the best-known futures markets are the New York Board of Trade, the New York Mercantile Exchange, and the Chicago Board of Trade. The Chicago Board Options Exchange is a major options market.

Futures and options are often called derivative securities because they derive their value from some underlying asset. Futures contracts are contracts for the future delivery of assets such as securities, foreign currencies, interest cash flows, or commodities. Corporations use these contracts to reduce (hedge) risk exposure caused by fluctuation in things such as foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. We illustrate the use of futures contracts further in Chapter 21.

Options contracts call for one party (the option writer) to perform a specific act if called upon to do so by the option buyer or owner. Options contracts, like futures contracts, can be used to hedge risk in situations where the firm faces risk from price fluctuations. Chapter 20 discusses options in detail.

2.4 Market Efficiency
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what an efficient market is and why market efficiency is important to financial managers.
Financial markets, such as the bond and stock markets, help bring together buyers and sellers of securities. They reduce the cost of buying and selling securities by providing a physical location or computer trading system where investors can trade securities. The supply and demand for securities are better reflected in organized markets because much of the total supply and demand for securities flows through these centralized locations or trading systems. Any price that balances the overall supply and demand for a security is a market equilibrium price.

Ideally, economists would like financial markets to price securities at their true (intrinsic) value. A security’s true value is the present value (the value in today’s dollars) of the cash flows an investor who owns that security can expect to receive in the future. This present value, in turn, reflects all available information about the size, timing, and riskiness of the cash flows at the time the price was set.3 As new information becomes available, investors adjust their cash flow estimates. Through buying and selling, the price of a security adjusts to reflect this information.

true (intrinsic) value for a security, the present value of the cash flows an investor who owns that security can expect to receive in the future

Markets such as those just described are called efficient markets. More formally, in an efficient market, security prices fully reflect the knowledge and expectations of all investors at a particular point in time. If markets are efficient, investors and financial managers have no reason to believe the securities are not priced at or near their true value. The more efficient a market is, the more likely securities are to be priced at or near their true value.

efficient market market where prices reflect the knowledge and expectations of all investors

The overall efficiency of a market depends on its operational efficiency and its informational efficiency. Market operational efficiency concerns the costs of bringing together buyers and sellers. The costs of bringing together buyers and sellers are called transaction costs and include such things as broker commissions and other fees and expenses. The lower these costs, the more operationally efficient markets are. Why is operational efficiency important? If transaction costs are high, market prices will be more volatile, fewer financial transactions will take place, and prices will not reflect the knowledge and expectations of investors as accurately.

market operational efficiency the degree to which the transaction costs of bringing buyers and sellers together are minimized

Market informational efficiency is exhibited if market prices reflect all relevant information about securities at a particular point in time. As suggested above, informational efficiency is influenced by operational efficiency, but it also depends on the availability of information and the ability of investors to buy and sell securities based on that information. In an informationally efficient market, market prices adjust quickly to new information as it becomes available. Prices adjust quickly because many security analysts and investors are gathering and trading on information about securities to make a profit. Note that competition among investors is an important driver of informational efficiency.

market informational efficiency the degree to which current market prices reflect relevant information and, therefore, the true value of the security

Efficient Market Hypotheses
Public financial markets are efficient in part because regulators such as the SEC require issuers of publicly traded securities to disclose a great deal of information about those securities to investors. Investors are constantly evaluating the prospects for these securities and acting on the conclusions from their analyses by trading them. If the price of a security is out of line with what investors think it should be, then investors will buy or sell that security, causing its price to adjust to reflect their assessment of its value. The ability of investors to easily observe transaction prices and trade volumes and to inexpensively trade securities in public markets contributes to the efficiency of this process. This buying and selling by investors is the mechanism through which prices adjust to reflect the market’s consensus. The theory about how well this mechanism works is known as the efficient market hypothesis. We next discuss the three forms of the efficient market hypothesis, which describe different degrees of market efficiency.

efficient market hypothesis a theory concerning the extent to which information is reflected in security prices and how information gets incorporated into security prices

Strong-Form Efficiency
The market for a security is perfectly informationally efficient if the security’s price always reflects all information. The idea that all information about a security is reflected in its price is known as the strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. Few people really believe that market prices of public securities reflect all available information, however. It is widely accepted that insiders have information that is not reflected in the security prices. Thus, the concept of strong-form market efficiency represents the ideal case rather than the real world.

strong form of the efficient market hypothesis the theory that security prices reflect all information

If a security market were strong-form efficient, then it would not be possible to earn abnormally high returns (returns greater than those justified by the risks) by trading on private information—information unavailable to other investors—because there would be no such information. In addition, since all information would already be reflected in security prices, the price of a share of a particular security would change only when new information about its prospects became available.

private information information that is not available to all investors

Semistrong-Form Efficiency
A weaker form of the efficient market hypothesis, known as the semistrong form of the efficient market hypothesis, holds only that all public information—information that is available to all investors—is reflected in security prices. Investors who have private information are able to profit by trading on this information before it becomes public. For example, suppose that conversations with the customers of a firm indicate to an investor that the firm’s sales, and thereby its cash flows, are increasing more rapidly than other investors expect. To profit from this information, the investor buys the firm’s stock. By buying the stock, the investor helps drive up the price to the point where it accurately reflects the higher level of cash flows.

semistrong form of the efficient market hypothesis the theory that security prices reflect all public information but not all private information

public information information that is available to all investors

The concept of semistrong-form efficiency is a reasonable representation of the public stock markets in developed countries such as the United States. In a market characterized by this sort of efficiency, as soon as information becomes public, it is quickly reflected in stock prices through trading activity. Studies of the speed at which new information is reflected in stock prices indicate that by the time you read a hot tip in the Wall Street Journal or a business magazine, it is too late to benefit by trading on it.

Weak-Form Efficiency
The weakest form of the efficient market hypothesis is known, aptly enough, as the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis. This hypothesis holds that all information contained in past prices of a security is reflected in current prices but that there is both public and private information that is not. In a weak-form efficient market, it would not be possible to earn abnormally high returns by looking for patterns in security prices, but it would be possible to do so by trading on public or private information.

weak form of the efficient market hypothesis the theory that security prices reflect all information in past prices but do not reflect all private or all public information

An important conclusion of the efficient market hypothesis is that at any point in time, all securities with the same risk should be priced to offer the same expected return. The more efficient the market, the more likely this is to happen. Since both the bond and stock markets are relatively efficient, this means that securities of similar risk will offer the same expected return. This conclusion is important because it provides the basis for identifying the proper discount rate to use in applying the bond and stock valuation models developed in Chapters 8 and 9.

How does information about a firm’s prospects get reflected in its share price?
What is strong-form market efficiency? semistrong-form market efficiency? weak-form market efficiency?

The concept of market efficiency originated with the Ph.D. dissertation that Eugene Fama wrote at the University of Chicago. In 2013, Dr. Fama received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his research on market efficiency. You can see a video of an interview with Dr. Fama about market efficiency at www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9bYOBuKF4

2.5 Financial Institutions and Indirect Financing
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain how financial institutions serve the needs of consumers and small businesses.
As we mentioned earlier, many business firms are too small to sell their debt or equity directly to investors. They have neither the expert knowledge nor the financing requirements to make transacting in wholesale markets cost-effective. When these companies need funds for capital investments or for liquidity adjustments, their only feasible choice is to borrow in the indirect market from a financial institution. These financial institutions act as intermediaries, converting financial securities with one set of characteristics into securities with another set of characteristics. This process is called financial intermediation. The hallmark of indirect financing is that a financial institution—an intermediary—stands between the lender-saver and the borrower-spender. This route is shown at the bottom of Exhibit 2.1.

financial intermediation conversion of securities with one set of characteristics into securities with another set of characteristics

Indirect Market Transactions
We worked through an example of indirect financing at the beginning of the chapter. In that situation, a college student had $5,000 to invest for three months. A bank sold the student a three-month consumer CD for $5,000, pooled this $5,000 with the proceeds from checking and savings accounts and other CDs, and used the money to make small-business loans, one of which was a $30,000 loan to a pizza parlor owner. Following is a schematic diagram of that transaction:


The bank raises money from deposits to checking and savings accounts and by selling CDs and then uses the money to make loans to businesses or consumers.

On a larger scale, insurance companies provide much of the long-term financing in the economy through the indirect credit market. These companies invest heavily in corporate bonds and equity securities using funds they receive when they sell insurance policies to individuals and businesses. The schematic diagram for intermediation by an insurance company is as follows:


Notice an important difference between indirect and direct financial markets. In the direct market, as securities flow between lender-savers and borrower-spenders, the form of the securities remains unchanged. In indirect markets, however, as securities flow between lender-savers and borrower-spenders, they are repackaged, and their form is changed. In the example above, money from the sale of insurance policies becomes investments in corporate debt or equity. By repackaging securities, financial intermediaries tailor-make a wide range of financial products and services that meet the needs of consumers, small businesses, and large corporations. Their products and services are particularly important for smaller businesses that do not have access to direct financial markets.

Somewhat surprisingly, indirect markets are a much larger and more important source of financing to businesses than the more newsworthy direct financial markets. This is true not only in the United States, but in all industrial countries as well.

Financial Institutions and Their Services
We have briefly discussed the role of financial institutions as intermediaries in the indirect financial market. Next, we look at various types of financial institutions and the services they provide to small businesses as well as large corporations. We discuss only financial institutions that provide a significant amount of services to businesses.

Commercial Banks

Commercial banks are the most prominent and largest financial intermediaries in the economy and offer the widest range of financial services to businesses. Nearly every business, small or large, has a significant relationship with a commercial bank—usually a checking or transaction account and some type of credit or loan arrangement. For businesses, the most common type of bank loan is a line of credit (often called revolving credit), which works much like a credit card. A line of credit is a commitment by the bank to lend a firm an amount up to a predetermined limit, which can be used as needed. Banks also make term loans, which are fixed-rate loans with a maturity of one year to 10 years. In addition, banks do a significant amount of equipment lease financing. A lease is a contract that gives a business the right to use an asset, such as office space, a truck, or a computer mainframe, for a period of time in exchange for periodic payments. Leases are discussed in the Appendix to Chapter 16.

An increasing number of commercial banking services are also being provided by financial technology, or “FinTech,” companies. FinTech companies leverage many of the new capabilities associated with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing to provide businesses with financial services typically provided by brick-and-mortar commercial banks. One of the largest FinTech providers to businesses today is Square, which offers point-of-sale systems and payments processing, payroll services, and small business lending through its Square Capital subsidiary. Other FinTech business loan providers such as Kabbage, Lendio, Accion, and Funding Circle offer startup companies, as well as established businesses, simple platforms to quickly secure working capital and long-term financing.

Life and Casualty Insurance Companies

Two types of insurance companies are important in the financial markets: (1) life insurance companies and (2) casualty insurance companies, which sell protection against loss of property from fire, theft, accidents, and other causes. The cash flows for both types of companies are fairly predictable. As a result, they are able to provide funding to corporations through the purchase of stocks and bonds in the direct credit markets as well as funding for both public and private corporations through private placement financing. Businesses of all sizes purchase life insurance programs as part of their employee benefit packages and purchase casualty insurance policies to protect physical assets such as automobiles, truck fleets, equipment, and entire plants.

Pension Funds

Pension funds invest retirement funds on behalf of businesses or government agencies that provide retirement programs for their employees. Pension funds obtain money from employee and employer contributions during the employee’s working years, and they provide monthly cash payments upon retirement. Because of the predictability of these cash flows, pension fund managers invest in corporate bonds and equity securities purchased in the direct financial markets and participate in the private placement market.

Investment Funds

Investment funds, such as mutual funds, sell shares to investors and use the funds to purchase securities. As a result, they are an important source of business funding. For example, mutual funds may focus on purchasing (1) equity or debt securities; (2) securities of small or medium-size corporations; (3) securities of companies in a particular industry, such as energy, computer, or information technology, or (4) foreign investments.

Business Finance Companies

Business finance companies obtain the majority of their funds by selling short-term debt, called commercial paper, to investors in direct credit markets. These funds are used to make a variety of short- and intermediate-term loans and leases to small and large businesses. The loans are often secured by accounts receivable or inventory. Business finance companies are typically more willing than commercial banks to make loans and leases to firms with higher levels of default risk.

Corporations and the Financial System
We began this chapter by saying that financial managers need to understand the financial system in order to make sound decisions. We now follow up on that statement by briefly describing how corporations operate within the financial system. The interaction between the financial system and a large corporation is shown in Exhibit 2.3. The arrows show the major cash flows for a firm over a typical operating cycle. These cash flows relate to some of the key decisions that the financial manager must make. As you know, those decisions involve three major areas: capital budgeting, financing, and working capital management.

Let’s work through an example using Exhibit 2.3 to illustrate how corporate businesses use the financial system. Suppose you are the CFO of a new high-tech firm that is being formed in a joint venture with 3M Corporation. The new firm has a well-thought-out business plan, owns some valuable technology, and will operate one manufacturing facility. The company will be large enough to have access to public markets. The company plans to use its core technology to develop and sell a number of new products that the marketing department believes will generate a strong market demand.

EXHIBIT 2.3 Cash Flows between the Firm and the Financial System This exhibit shows how the financial system helps businesses finance their activities. The arrows in the exhibit indicate the major cash flows into and out of a firm over a typical operating cycle. Money obtained from the financial system, combined with reinvested cash flows from operations, enables a firm to make necessary investments and fund any other requirements.


To start the new company, management’s first task is to sell equity and debt to finance the firm. The senior management team and 3M will provide 40 percent of the equity, and the balance will come from an initial public offering (IPO) of common stock. An IPO is a corporation’s first offering of its stock to the public. In this example, management hires Morgan Stanley as its investment bank to underwrite the new securities. After the deal is underwritten, the new venture receives the proceeds from the stock sale, less Morgan Stanley’s underwriting fees (see arrow E in the exhibit).4

In addition to the equity financing, 30 percent of the firm’s total funding will come from the sale of long-term debt through a private placement deal with a large insurance company (see arrow B). Management decided to use a private placement because the lender is willing to commit to lend the firm additional money in the future if the firm meets certain performance goals. Since management has ambitious growth plans, locking in a future source of funds is important.

Once the funds from the debt and equity sales are in hand, they are deposited in the firm’s account at a commercial bank. Management then decides to lease an existing manufacturing facility and the equipment necessary to manufacture the new high-technology products; the cash outflows are represented by arrow A.

To begin manufacturing, the firm needs to raise working capital and does this by (1) selling commercial paper in the money markets (arrow C) and (2) obtaining a line of credit from a bank (arrow D). As the firm becomes operational, it generates residual cash inflows from its productive assets (arrow G). Some of these cash inflows are reinvested in the business (arrow H), and the remainder is used to pay cash dividends to stockholders or repurchase shares (arrow F).

2.6 The Determinants of Interest Rate Levels
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Compute the nominal and the real rates of interest, differentiating between them.
We conclude this chapter by examining factors that determine the general level of interest rates in the economy and describing how interest rates vary over the business cycle. Understanding interest rates is important because the financial instruments and most of the financial services discussed in this chapter are priced in terms of interest rates. We will continue our discussion of interest rates in Chapter 8, where we consider why different firms have different borrowing costs.

The Real Rate of Interest
One of the most important economic variables in the economy is the real rate of interest—an interest rate determined in the absence of inflation. Inflation is the amount by which aggregate price levels rise over time. The real rate of interest is (1) the inflation-adjusted return earned by lender-savers and (2) the inflation-adjusted cost incurred by borrower-spenders when they borrow.

The real rate of interest is not observable because all industrial economies operate with some degree of inflation. The rate that we actually observe in the marketplace at a given time is unadjusted for inflation and is called the nominal rate of interest. The factors that determine the real rate of interest, however, are the underlying determinants of all interest rates we observe in the marketplace. For this reason, an understanding of the real rate is important.

nominal rate of interest the rate of interest that is unadjusted for inflation

Determinants of the Real Rate of Interest

The fundamental determinants of interest rates are the returns earned on investments in productive assets (capital investments) and individuals’ time preference for consumption. Let’s examine how these two factors interact to determine the real rate of interest.

Returns on Investments
Recall from Chapter 1 that businesses invest in capital projects that are expected to generate positive cash flows by producing additional real output, such as cars, machinery, computers, and video games. The output generated by a capital project constitutes its return on investment, which is usually measured as a percentage. For example, if a capital project costs $1,000 and produces $180 in cash flows each year, the project’s return on investment is 18 percent ($180/$1,000 = 0.18, or 18 percent).

For a capital project to be attractive, its return on investment must exceed the cost of the funds (debt and equity) used to finance it. Intuitively, this makes sense because if an investment earns a return greater than the cost of funding, it should be profitable and thus should increase the value of the firm. For example, if the cost of funding—often called the cost of capital—is 15 percent, the capital project mentioned above would be attractive (18 percent > 15 percent) and would therefore be undertaken. If the capital project was expected to earn only 13 percent, though, the project would be rejected (13 percent < 15 percent). The cost of capital is the minimum acceptable rate of return on a capital project.

Decision Making Example 2.1 illustrates an application of the idea that an attractive project is one for which the return on investment exceeds the cost of funds.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 2.1
Capital Budgeting Preview

Situation

Sonic Manufacturing Company’s capital budget includes six projects that management has identified as having merit. The CFO’s staff computed the return on investment for each project. The average cost of funding each project is 10 percent. The projects are as follows:

Project	Return on Investment
A	13.0%
B	12.0
C	10.9
D	10.5
E	  9.8
F	  8.9
Which capital projects should the firm undertake?



Time Preference for Consumption
All other things being equal, most people prefer to consume goods today rather than tomorrow. This is called a positive time preference for consumption. For example, most people who want to buy a new car prefer to have it now rather than wait until they have earned enough cash to make the purchase. When people consume today, however, they realize that their future consumption may be less because they have forgone the opportunity to save and earn interest on their savings.

Given people’s positive time preference for consumption, the interest rate offered on financial instruments determines how much people will save. At low rates of interest, it hardly makes sense to save, so most people will continue to spend money rather than put money aside in savings. To coax people to postpone current spending, interest rates must be raised.

Equilibrium Condition. Higher interest rates reduce business investment (or spending) because fewer capital projects can earn a high enough return on investment to cover the added interest cost. They also reduce demand for borrowing by consumers. At the same time, lender-savers spend less and want to lend more money when interest rates are high. The real rate of interest depends on the interaction between these two opposing factors. Using a supply-and-demand framework, Exhibit 2.4 shows that the equilibrium market rate of interest (r) is the point where the desired level of borrowing (B) by borrower-spenders equals the desired level of lending (L) by lender-savers.5

Fluctuations in the Real Rate

In the supply-and-demand framework discussed previously, any economic factor that causes a shift in desired lending or desired borrowing will cause a change in the equilibrium rate of interest. For example, a major breakthrough in technology should cause a shift to the right in the desired level of borrowing schedule, thus increasing the real rate of interest. This makes intuitive sense because the new technology should spawn an increase in investment opportunities, increasing the desired level of borrowing. Similarly, a reduction in the corporate tax rate should provide businesses with more money to spend on investments, which should increase the desired level of borrowing schedule, causing the real rate of interest to increase.

EXHIBIT 2.4 The Determinants of the Equilibrium Rate of Interest The equilibrium rate of interest is a function of supply and demand. Lender-savers are willing to supply more funds as interest rates go up, but borrower-spenders demand fewer funds at higher interest rates. The interest rate at which the supply of funds equals the demand for those funds is the equilibrium rate.


One factor that would shift the desired level of lending to the right, and hence lead to a decrease in the real rate of interest, would be a decrease in the tax rates for individuals. Lower individual tax rates would leave lender-savers with more money to lend. Also, with lower individual tax rates, lender-savers could receive a lower interest rate and earn the same after-tax return. Another factor would be monetary policy action by the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors to increase the money supply. A larger money supply would increase the amount of money available for lending.

Other forces that could affect the real rate of interest include growth in population, demographic variables such as the age of the population, and cultural differences. In sum, the real rate of interest reflects a complex set of forces that control the desired level of lending and borrowing in the economy. The real rate of interest has historically been around 3 percent for the U.S. economy but has typically varied between 2 and 4 percent because of changes in economic conditions.

Loan Contracts and Inflation
The real rate of interest does not account for inflation, but price-level changes in the real world are a fact of life, and these changes affect the value of a loan contract or, for that matter, any financial contract. For example, if prices rise due to inflation during the life of a loan contract, the purchasing power of the dollar decreases because the borrower repays the lender with inflated dollars—dollars with less buying power.6

To see the impact of inflation on a loan, let’s look at an example. Suppose that you lend a friend $1,000 for one year at a 4 percent interest rate. Furthermore, you plan to buy a new surfboard for $1,040 in one year when you graduate from college. With the $40 of interest you earn ($1,000 × 0.04 = $40), you will have just enough money to buy the surfboard. At the end of the year, you graduate, and your friend pays off the loan, giving you $1,040. Unfortunately, the rate of inflation during the year was an unexpected 10 percent, and your surfboard now will cost 10 percent more, or $1,144 ($1,040 × 1.10 = $1,144). You have experienced a 10 percent decrease in your purchasing power due to the unanticipated inflation. The loss of purchasing power is $104 ($1,144 − $1,040 = $104).

The Fisher Equation and Inflation
How do we write a loan contract that provides protection against loss of purchasing power due to inflation? We have no crystal ball to tell us what the actual rate of inflation will be when the loan contract is written. However, market participants collectively (often called “the market”) have expectations about how prices will change during the contract period.

To incorporate these inflation expectations into a loan contract, we need to adjust the real rate of interest by the amount of inflation that is expected during the contract period. The mathematical formula used to adjust the real rate of interest for the expected rate of inflation is as follows:

(2.1)
where:

i	=	nominal (or market) rate of interest
r	=	real rate of interest
ΔPe	=	expected annualized price-level change
rΔPe	=	adjustment of the interest rate for expected price-level change
Equation 2.1 is called the Fisher equation. It is named after Irving Fisher, who first developed the concept and is considered by many to be one of America’s greatest economists.

Applying Equation 2.1 to our surfboard example, we can find out what the nominal rate of interest should be if the expected inflation rate is 10 percent and the real rate of interest is 4 percent:

Looking at Equation 2.1, notice that ΔPe is the expected price-level change and not the realized (actual) rate of inflation (ΔPa). Thus, to properly determine the nominal rate of interest, it is necessary to predict prices over the life of the loan contract. Also, recall that the nominal rate of interest is the market rate of interest—the rate actually observed in financial markets. The real and nominal rates of interest are equal only when the expected rate of inflation over the contract period is zero (ΔPe = 0).7

When either r or ΔPe is a small number, or when both are small, then rΔPe is very small and is approximately equal to zero. In these situations, it is common practice to write the Fisher equation as a simple additive function, where the nominal rate of interest is divided into two parts: (1) the real rate of interest and (2) the anticipated percent change in the price level. The simplified (or approximate) Fisher equation can be written as follows:

(2.2)
Thus, for our one-year loan example:

The difference in the contract loan rates between the two variations of the Fisher equation is 0.40 percent (14.40 percent − 14.00 percent = 0.40 percent), a difference of less than 3 percent (0.40/14.40 = 0.0278, or 2.78 percent). Thus, dropping rΔPe from the equation makes the equation easier to understand without creating a significant computational error.

Learning by Doing Applications 2.2 and 2.3 illustrate applications of the Fisher equation.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 2.2
Calculating a New Inflation Premium

Problem

The current one-year Treasury bill rate is 2.0 percent. On CNBC.com, several economists at leading investment and commercial banks predict that the annual inflation rate is going to be 0.25 percent higher than originally expected. The higher inflation forecasts reflect unexpectedly strong employment figures released by the government that afternoon. What is the current inflation premium if the real rate of interest is 0.5 percent? When the market opens tomorrow, what should happen to the one-year Treasury bill rate?





LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 2.3
International Loan Rate

Problem

You are a financial manager at a manufacturing company that is going to make a one-year loan to a key supplier in another country. The loan will be made in the supplier’s local currency. The supplier’s government controls the banking system, and there are no reliable market data available. For this reason, you have spoken with five economists who have some knowledge about the economy. Their predictions for inflation next year are 30, 40, 45, 50, and 60 percent.

What rate should your firm charge for the one-year business loan if you are not concerned about the possibility that your supplier will default? You recall that the real rate of interest is, on average, 3 percent over the long run.





Cyclical and Long-Term Trends in Interest Rates
Now let’s look at some market data to see how interest rates have actually fluctuated over the past five decades in the United States. Exhibit 2.5 plots the interest rate yield on 10-year government bonds since 1960 to represent interest rate movements. In addition, the exhibit plots the annual rate of inflation, represented by the annual percent change in the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is a price index that measures the change in prices of a market basket of goods and services that a typical consumer purchases. Finally, the shaded areas on the chart indicate periods of recession. Recession occurs when real output from the economy is decreasing and unemployment is increasing. Each shaded area begins at the peak of the business cycle and ends at the bottom (or trough) of the recession. From our discussion of interest rates and an examination of Exhibit 2.5, we can draw two general conclusions:

The level of interest rates tends to rise and fall with changes in the actual rate of inflation. The positive relation between the rate of inflation and the level of interest rates is what we should expect given Equation 2.1. Thus, we feel comfortable concluding that inflationary expectations have a major impact on interest rates.
Our findings also explain in part why interest rates can vary substantially between countries. For example, in November 2020 the long-term expected rate of inflation in the United States was 1.4 percent; during the same period, the rate of inflation in Russia was 4.0 percent. If the real rate of interest is 3.0 percent, the long-term interest rate in the United States in 2020 should have been around 4.4 percent (3.0 percent + 1.4 percent = 4.4 percent) and the Russian interest rate should have been around 7.0 percent (3.0 percent + 4.0 percent = 7.0 percent). In fact, at the end of November 2020 the U.S. 10-year interest rate was about 1.00 percent and the Russian rate was 5.85 percent. Though hardly scientific, this analysis illustrates the point that countries with higher rates of inflation or expected rates of inflation will have higher interest rates than countries with lower inflation rates.

EXHIBIT 2.5 Relation between Annual Inflation Rate and Long-Term Interest Rate (1960–2019) Based on the graph shown in the exhibit, we can draw two important conclusions about interest rate movements. First, the level of interest rates tends to rise and fall with the actual rate of inflation—a conclusion also supported by the Fisher equation, which suggests that interest rates rise and fall with the expected rate of inflation. Second, the level of interest rates tends to rise during periods of economic expansion and decline during periods of economic contraction.


Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor (www.bls.gov/cpi), U.S. Department of the Treasury (www.treasury.gov), and Wikipedia (www.en.wikipedia.org).
The level of interest rates tends to rise during periods of economic expansion and decline during periods of economic contraction. It makes sense that interest rates should increase during years of economic expansion. The reasoning is that as the economy expands, businesses begin to borrow money to build up inventories and to invest in more production capacity in anticipation of increased sales. As unemployment begins to decrease, the economic future looks bright, and consumers begin to buy more homes, cars, and other durable items on credit. As a result, the demand for funds by both businesses and consumers increases, driving interest rates up. Also, near the end of expansion, the rate of inflation begins to accelerate, which puts upward pressure on interest rates. At some point, the Fed becomes concerned over the increasing inflation in the economy and begins to tighten credit, which further raises interest rates, slowing down the economy. The higher interest rates in the economy choke off spending by both businesses and consumers.
During a recession, the opposite takes place; businesses and consumers rein in their spending and their use of credit, putting downward pressure on interest rates. To stimulate demand for goods and services, the Fed will typically begin to make more credit available to lower interest rates in the economy and encourage business and consumer spending.

Also notice in Exhibit 2.5 that periods of business expansion tend to be much longer than periods of contraction (recessions). Since the end of the Great Depression, the average period of economic expansion has lasted three to four years and the average period of contraction about nine months. Keep in mind that the numbers given are averages and that actual periods of economic expansion and contraction can vary widely from averages. For example, the business expansion from October 2001 to December 2007 lasted 6 years and two months and the recession that followed it lasted 18 months, from December 2007 to June 2009.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Describe the role of the financial system in the economy and the two basic ways in which money flows through the system.

The role of the financial system is to gather money from households, businesses, and governments with surplus funds to invest (lender-savers) and channel that money to households, businesses, and governments who need money (borrower-spenders). If the financial system works properly, only investment projects with high rates of return and good credit are financed and all other projects are rejected. Money flows through the financial system in two basic ways: (1) directly, through financial markets, and (2) indirectly, through financial institutions.

2 Discuss direct financing and the important role that investment banks play in this process.

Direct markets are wholesale markets where lender-savers and borrower-spenders deal directly with one another. For example, corporations sell securities, such as stocks and bonds, directly to investors in exchange for money, which they use to invest in their businesses. Investment banks are important in the direct markets because they help borrower-spenders sell their new security issues. The services provided by investment bankers include origination, underwriting, and distribution.

3 Describe the primary, secondary, and money markets, explaining the special importance of secondary and money markets to business organizations.

Primary markets are markets in which new securities are sold for the first time. Secondary markets are markets for securities that were previously issued. Not all securities have active secondary markets. Active secondary markets are important because they enable investors to convert securities easily to cash. Business firms whose securities are traded in secondary markets are able to issue new securities at a lower cost than they otherwise could because investors are willing to pay a higher price for securities that have active secondary markets.

Large corporations use money markets to adjust their liquidity because cash inflows and outflows are rarely perfectly synchronized. Thus, on the one hand, if cash expenditures exceed cash receipts, a firm can borrow short-term in the money markets. If that firm holds a portfolio of money market instruments, it can sell some of these securities for cash. On the other hand, if cash receipts exceed expenditures, the firm can temporarily invest the funds in short-term money market instruments. Businesses are willing to invest large amounts of idle cash in money market instruments because of their high liquidity and their low default risk.

4 Explain what an efficient market is and why market efficiency is important to financial managers.

An efficient market is a market where security prices reflect the knowledge and expectations of all investors. Public markets, for example, are more efficient than private markets because issuers of public securities are required to disclose a great deal of information about these securities to investors and investors are constantly evaluating the prospects for these securities and acting on the conclusions from their analyses by trading them. Market efficiency is important to investors because it assures them that the securities they buy are priced close to their true value.

5 Explain how financial institutions serve the needs of consumers and small businesses.

One problem with direct financing is that it takes place in a wholesale market. Most consumers and small businesses do not have the skills, financing requirements, or money to transact in this market. In contrast, a large portion of the indirect market focuses on providing financial services to consumers and small businesses. For example, commercial banks collect money from consumers in small dollar amounts through checking accounts, savings accounts, and consumer CDs. They then aggregate the funds and make loans in larger amounts to consumers and businesses. The financial services provided by financial institutions are tailor-made to fit the needs of the markets they serve. Exhibit 2.3 illustrates how businesses use the financial system.

6 Compute the nominal and the real rates of interest, differentiating between them.

Equations 2.1 and 2.2 are used to compute the nominal (real) rate of interest when you have the real (nominal) rate and the inflation rate. The real rate of interest is the interest rate that would exist in the absence of inflation. It is determined by the interaction of (1) the rate of return that businesses can expect to earn on capital projects and (2) individuals’ time preference for consumption. The interest rate we observe in the marketplace is called the nominal rate of interest. The nominal rate of interest is composed of two parts: (1) the real rate of interest and (2) the expected rate of inflation.

5 The model presented here is based on the loanable funds theory of market equilibrium. Saving (or giving up current consumption) is the source of loanable funds, and personal and business spending (or investment) is the use of funds.
6 Recall from economics two important relations: (1) The value of money is its purchasing power—what you can buy with it, and (2) there is a negative relation between changes in price level and the value of money. As the price level increases (inflation), the value of money decreases, and as the price level decreases (deflation), the value of money increases. This makes sense because when we have rising prices (inflation), our dollars will buy less.
7 In economics the terms nominal and real are frequently used as modifiers, as in nominal GNP and real GNP. Nominal means that the data are from the marketplace; thus, the values may contain price-level changes due to inflation. Real means the data are corrected for changes in purchasing power.

On October 20, 2020, after the close of U.S. financial markets, Netflix announced revenues for the third quarter of the year of $6.44 billion and earnings per share of $1.74. The news shocked both investors and Wall Street analysts who had forecast that the firm would make much more money during the quarter. The performance was particularly surprising given that, heading into the third quarter, Netflix management had announced they expected earnings per share of around $2.09. As it turned out, Netflix attributed its shortfall to adding fewer customers than management had expected. Netflix’s share price fell with the news, losing nearly 5 percent in the hours following the earnings announcement.

This example illustrates the close relation between the information contained in a firm’s accounting statements and its stock performance. Public corporations in the United States communicate their financial performance to their investors through their financial statements, leading to Wall Street’s virtual obsession with accounting earnings. Analysts estimate what a firm’s revenue should be and how much the firm should earn in a particular reporting period, and if the firm fails to meet these estimates it can be punished by a drop in its stock price. If a firm consistently fails to meet these estimates, its CEO can be out of a job. Pressure to meet analyst expectations has occasionally led managers to misstate accounting results in an attempt to mislead analysts and investors. In the wake of several large-scale accounting frauds, involving firms such as Enron and WorldCom, Congress and federal regulators tightened accounting standards and oversight of the accounting profession in the early 2000s. Passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, discussed in Chapter 1, is an example of these steps.

Clearly, the correct preparation of financial statements is crucial for investors. In this chapter and the next, we focus on the preparation, interpretation, and limitations of financial statements. The concepts that we discuss in these chapters provide an important foundation for the material discussed in the rest of this book.

Chapter Preview
In Chapter 1 we noted that all businesses have owners and stakeholders—managers, creditors, suppliers, and the government, among others—who have claims on the firm’s cash flows. The owners and stakeholders in a firm need to monitor the firm’s progress and evaluate its performance. Financial statements enable them to do this. The accounting system is the framework that gathers information about the firm’s business activities and translates the information into objective numerical financial reports.

Most firms prepare financial statements on a regular basis and have independent auditors certify that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and contain no material misstatements. The audit increases the confidence of the owners and stakeholders that the financial statements prepared by management present a “fair and accurate” picture of the firm’s financial condition at a particular point in time. In fact, it is difficult to get any type of legitimate business loan without audited financial statements.

This chapter reviews the basic structure of a firm’s financial statements and explains how the various statements fit together. It also explains the relation between accounting income and cash flow to investors. We begin by examining the preparation of the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of retained earnings, and the statement of cash flows. As you read through this part of the chapter, pay particular attention to the differences between (1) book value and market value and (2) accounting income and cash flow to investors. Understanding the differences between these concepts is necessary to avoid serious analytical and decision-making errors. The last part of the chapter discusses essential features of the federal tax code for corporations. In finance we make most decisions on an after-tax basis, so understanding the tax code is very important.

3.1 Financial Statements and Accounting Principles
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and their importance to the economy.
Before we can meaningfully interpret and analyze financial statements, we need to understand some accounting principles that guide their preparation. Thus, we begin the chapter with a discussion of generally accepted accounting principles, which guide firms in the preparation of financial statements. First, however, we briefly describe the annual report.

The Annual Report
The annual report is the most important report that firms issue to their stockholders and make available to the general public. Historically, annual reports were dull, black-and-white publications that presented audited financial statements for firms. Today some annual reports, especially those of large public companies, are slick, picture-laden, full-color documents with orchestrated media messages.

Annual reports typically are divided into three distinct sections. First are the financial tables, which contain financial information about the firm and its operations for the year, and an accompanying summary explaining the firm’s performance over the past year. For example, the summary might explain that sales and profits were down because of declining consumer demand. Often, there is a letter from the chairperson or CEO that provides some insights into the reasons for the firm’s performance, a discussion of new developments, and a high-level view of the firm’s strategy and future direction. It is important to note that the financial tables are historical records reflecting past performance of the firm and do not necessarily indicate what the firm will do in the future.

The second part of the report is often a corporate public relations piece discussing the firm’s product lines, its services to its customers, its contributions to the communities in which it operates, and its relationships with other stakeholders. Over the last few years there has been increased attention paid to corporate social, environmental (or sustainability), and governance policies by companies and investors. As a result, many companies regularly report additional nonfinancial information on these issues both inside and outside of their financial statements. In fact, a 2020 survey of approximately 500 large U.S. firms found that 90 percent published a separate report on their sustainability practices, up from just 20 percent publishing such reports in 2011.1 These reports often include details about the firm’s policies and goals on a variety of social and environmental issues ranging from carbon emissions to workplace diversity, equity and inclusion.

The third part of the annual report presents the audited financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of retained earnings, and the statement of cash flows. Overall, the annual report provides a good overview of the firm’s operating and financial performance and states why, in management’s judgment, things turned out the way they did.

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
In the United States, accounting statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), a set of widely agreed-upon rules and procedures that defines how companies are to maintain financial records and prepare financial reports. These principles are important because without them, financial statements would be less standardized. Accounting standards such as GAAP make it easier for analysts and management to make meaningful comparisons of a company’s performance against that of other companies.

generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) a set of rules that defines how companies are to prepare financial statements

Accounting principles and reporting practices for U.S. firms are promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), a not-for-profit body that operates in the public interest. FASB derives its authority from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GAAP and reporting practices are published in the form of FASB standards, and certified public accountants are required to follow these standards in their auditing and accounting practices.

Fundamental Accounting Principles
To better understand financial statements, it is helpful to look at some fundamental accounting principles embodied in GAAP. These principles determine the manner of recording, measuring, and reporting company transactions. As you will see, the practical application of these principles requires professional judgment, which can result in considerable differences in financial statements.

The Assumption of Arm’s-Length Transactions

Accounting is based on the recording of economic transactions that can be quantified in dollar amounts. It assumes that the parties to a transaction are economically rational and are free to act independently of each other. In other words, all transactions are assumed to be “arm’s-length transactions.” The price you pay for something or the price for which you sell something is what gets recorded on the financial statements. To illustrate, let’s assume that you are preparing a personal balance sheet for a bank loan on which you must list all your assets. You are including your Tesla Model S as an asset. You bought the car a few months ago from your father for $10,000 when the market value of the car was $35,000. You got a good deal. However, the price you paid, which would be the number recorded on your balance sheet, was not the market value. Since you did not purchase the Tesla in an arm’s-length transaction, your balance sheet would not reflect the true value of the asset.

The Cost Principle

Generally, the value of an asset that is recorded on a company’s “books” reflects its historical cost. The historical cost is assumed to represent the fair market value of the item at the time it was acquired and is recorded as the book value. Over time, it is unlikely that an asset’s book value will be equal to its market value because market values tend to change over time. The major exception to this principle is marketable securities, such as the stock of another company, which are recorded at their current market value.

book value the net value of an asset or liability recorded on the financial statements—normally reflects historical cost

It is important to note that accounting statements are records of past performance; they are based on historical costs, not on current market prices or values. Accounting statements translate the business’s past performance into dollars and cents, which helps management and investors better understand how the business has performed in the past.

The Realization Principle

Under the realization principle, revenue is recognized only when the sale is essentially completed and the exchange value for the goods or services can be reliably determined. As a practical matter, this means that most revenues are recognized at the time of sale whether or not cash is actually received. At this time, if a firm sells to its customers on credit, an account receivable is recorded. The firm receives the cash only when the customer actually makes the payment. Although the realization principle seems straightforward, there can be considerable ambiguity in its interpretation. For example, should revenues be recognized when goods are ordered, when they are shipped, or when payment is received from the customer?

The Matching Principle

Accountants try to match revenue on the income statement with the expenses incurred to generate the revenue. In practice, this matching principle means that revenue is first recognized (according to the realization principle) and then is matched with the costs associated with producing the revenue. For example, if we manufacture a product and sell it on credit (accounts receivable), the revenue is recognized at the time of sale. The expenses associated with manufacturing the product—expenditures for raw materials, labor, equipment, and facilities—are recognized at the same time. Notice that the actual cash outflows for expenses may not occur at the same time the expenses are recognized. The figures on the income statement more than likely will not correspond to the actual cash inflows and outflows during the period.

The Going Concern Assumption

The going concern assumption is the assumption that a business will remain in operation for the foreseeable future. This assumption underlies much of what is done in accounting. For example, suppose that GameStop has $860 million of inventory on its balance sheet, representing what the firm actually paid for the inventory in arm’s-length transactions. If we assume that GameStop is a going concern, the balance sheet figure is a reasonable number because in the normal course of business we expect GameStop to be able to sell the goods for their cost plus some reasonable markup.

However, suppose GameStop declares bankruptcy and is forced by its creditors to liquidate its assets. If this happens, GameStop is no longer a going concern. What will the inventory be worth then? We cannot be certain, but 50 cents on the dollar might be a high figure. The going concern assumption allows the accountant to record assets at cost rather than their value in a liquidation sale, which is usually much less.

You can see that the fundamental accounting principles just discussed leave considerable professional discretion to accountants in the preparation of financial statements. As a result, financial statements can and do differ because of honest differences in professional judgments. Of course, there are limits on honest professional differences, and at some point an accountant’s choices can cross a line and result in “cooking the books.”

International GAAP
Accounting is often called the language of business. Just as there are different dialects within languages, there are different international “dialects” in accounting. For example, the set of generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom is called U.K. GAAP. Given the variation in accounting standards, accountants must adjust financial statements so that meaningful comparisons can be made between firms that utilize different accounting principles. The cost of making these adjustments represents an economic inefficiency that adds to the overall cost of international business transactions.

By the end of the 1990s, the two predominant international reporting standards were the U.S. GAAP and the International Financial Reporting Standards, also known as IFRS. Both FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have been working toward a convergence of these rules in an effort to provide a truly global accounting standard. Today most international jurisdictions utilize IFRS or some close variant of those standards. Consistent with these practices, the U.S. SEC has been reviewing proposals for U.S. corporations to adopt IFRS for financial reporting, but to date there has been no move to change the accounting standard from U.S. GAAP.

Illustrative Company: Diaz Manufacturing
In the next part of this chapter, we turn to a discussion of four fundamental financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of retained earnings, and the statement of cash flows. To more clearly illustrate these financial statements, we use data from Diaz Manufacturing Company, a fictional Houston-based provider of petroleum and industrial equipment and services worldwide.2 Diaz Manufacturing was formed in 2016 as a spin-off of several divisions of a large multinational corporation. The firm specializes in the design and manufacturing of systems used in petroleum production and has two divisions: (1) Diaz Energy Services, which sells oil and gas compression equipment, and (2) Diaz Manufacturing, which makes valves and related parts for energy production.

In 2020 Diaz Manufacturing’s sales were $1.56 billion, an increase of 12.8 percent from the previous year. A letter to stockholders in the 2020 annual report stated that management did not expect earnings in 2021 to exceed the 2020 earnings. The reason for caution was that Diaz’s earnings are very susceptible to changes in the political and economic environment in the world’s energy-producing regions, and with COVID-19 in 2020 the business environment was highly unstable. Management reassured investors, however, that Diaz had the financial strength and the management team needed to weather any economic adversity.

3.2 The Balance Sheet
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the balance sheet identity and why a balance sheet must balance.
The balance sheet reports the firm’s financial position at a particular point in time. Exhibit 3.1 shows the balance sheets for Diaz Manufacturing on December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2020. The left-hand side of the balance sheet identifies the firm’s assets, which are listed at book value. These assets are owned by the firm and are used to generate income. The right-hand side of the balance sheet includes liabilities and stockholders’ equity, which tell us how the firm has financed its assets. Liabilities are obligations of the firm that represent claims against its assets. These claims arise from debts and other obligations to pay creditors, employees, or the government. In contrast, stockholders’ equity represents the residual claim of the owners on the remaining assets of the firm after all liabilities have been paid.3 The basic balance sheet identity can thus be stated as follows:4

EXHIBIT 3.1 Diaz Manufacturing Balance Sheets as of December 31 ($ millions)

The left-hand side of the balance sheet lists the assets that the firm has at a particular point in time, while the right-hand side shows how the firm has financed those assets.

c150,000,000 common stock shares authorized.

(3.1)
Since stockholders’ equity is the residual claim, stockholders would receive any remaining value if the firm decided to sell off all of its assets and use the money to pay its creditors. That is why the balance sheet always balances. Simply put, if you total what the firm owns and what it owes, then the difference between the two is the total stockholders’ equity:

Notice that total stockholders’ equity can be positive, negative, or equal to zero.

It is important to note that balance sheet items are listed in a specific order. Assets are listed in order of their liquidity, with the most liquid assets, cash and marketable securities, at the top. The liquidity of an asset is defined by how quickly it can be converted into cash without loss of value. Thus, an asset’s liquidity has two dimensions: (1) the speed and ease with which the asset can be sold and (2) whether the asset can be sold without loss of value. Of course, any asset can be sold easily and quickly if the price is low enough. Liabilities on the balance sheet are listed based on their maturity, with the liabilities having the shortest maturities listed at the top. Maturity refers to the length of time remaining before the obligation must be paid.

Next, we examine some important balance sheet accounts of Diaz Manufacturing as of December 31, 2020 (see Exhibit 3.1). As a matter of convention, accountants classify assets and liabilities as short-term (or current) or long-term. We will start by looking at current assets and liabilities.

Current Assets and Liabilities
Current assets are assets that can reasonably be expected to be converted into cash within one year. Besides cash, which includes investments in marketable securities such as money market instruments, other current assets are accounts receivable, which are typically due within 30 to 45 days, and inventory, which is money invested in raw materials, work-in-process inventory, and finished goods. Diaz’s current assets at the end of 2020 totaled $1,039.8 million.

Current liabilities are obligations payable within one year. Typical current liabilities are accounts payable, which arise in the purchases of goods and services from vendors and are normally paid within 30 to 45 days; notes payable, which are formal borrowing agreements with a bank or some other lender that have a stated maturity; and accrued taxes from federal, state, and local governments, which are taxes Diaz owes but has not yet paid. Diaz’s total current liabilities were $377.8 million at the end of 2020.

Net Working Capital

Recall from Chapter 1 that the dollar difference between total current assets and total current liabilities is the firm’s net working capital:

(3.2)
Net working capital is a measure of a firm’s ability to meet its short-term obligations as they come due. One way that firms maintain their liquidity is by holding more current assets than current liabilities.

For Diaz Manufacturing, total current assets at the end of 2020 were $1,039.8 million, and total current liabilities were $377.8 million. The firm’s net working capital was thus:

To interpret this number, if Diaz Manufacturing took its current cash on hand and liquidated its marketable securities, accounts receivables, and inventory at book value, it would have $1,039.8 million with which to pay off its short-term liabilities of $377.8 million, leaving $662.0 million of “cushion.” As a short-term creditor, such as a bank, you would have a positive view of the net working capital position of Diaz because current assets exceed current liabilities by almost three times ($1,039.8/$377.8 = 2.75).

Accounting for Inventory

Inventory, as noted earlier, is a current asset on the balance sheet, but it is usually the least liquid of the current assets. The reason is that it can take a long time for a firm to convert inventory into cash. For a manufacturing firm, the inventory cycle begins with raw materials, continues with goods in process, proceeds with finished goods, and finally concludes with selling the asset for cash or an account receivable. For a firm such as The Boeing Company, for example, the inventory cycle in manufacturing an aircraft can be nearly a year.

An important decision for management is the selection of an inventory valuation method. The most common methods are FIFO (first in, first out) and LIFO (last in, first out). During periods of changing price levels, how a firm values its inventory affects both its balance sheet and its income statement. For example, suppose that prices have been rising (inflation). If a company values its inventory using the FIFO method, when the firm makes a sale, it assumes the sale is from the oldest, lowest-cost inventory—first in, first out. Thus, during rising prices, firms using FIFO will have the lowest cost of goods sold, the highest net income, and the highest inventory value. In contrast, a company using the LIFO method assumes the sale is from the newest, highest-cost inventory—last in, first out. During a period of inflation, firms using LIFO will have the highest cost of goods sold, the lowest net income, and the lowest inventory value.

Because inventory valuation methods can have a significant impact on both the income statement and the balance sheet, when financial analysts compare different companies, they make adjustments for differences in inventory valuation methods. Although firms can switch from one inventory valuation method to another, this type of change is an extraordinary event and cannot be done frequently.

Diaz Manufacturing reports inventory values in the United States using the LIFO method. The remaining inventories, which are located outside the United States and Canada, are calculated using the FIFO method. Diaz’s total inventory is $423.8 million at the end of 2020.

Long-Term Assets and Liabilities
The remaining assets on the balance sheet are classified as long-term assets. Typically, these assets are financed by long-term liabilities and stockholders’ equity.

Long-Term Assets

Long-term (productive) assets are the assets that the firm uses to generate most of its income. Long-term assets may be tangible or intangible. Tangible assets are balance sheet items such as land, mineral resources, buildings, equipment, machinery, and vehicles that are used over an extended period of time. In addition, tangible assets can include other businesses that a firm wholly or partially owns, such as foreign subsidiaries. Intangible assets are items such as patents, copyrights, licensing agreements, technology, and other intellectual capital the firm owns.

Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises only when a firm purchases another firm. Conceptually, goodwill is a measure of how much the price paid for the acquired firm exceeds the sum of the values of the acquired firm’s individual assets. There are a variety of reasons why the purchase price of an asset might exceed its value to the seller. Goodwill may arise from improvements in efficiency, the reputation or brands associated with products or trademarks, or even a valuable client base for a particular service. For example, if Diaz Manufacturing paid $2.0 million for a company that had individual assets with a total fair market value of $1.9 million, the goodwill paid would be $100,000 ($2.0 million − $1.9 million = $0.1 million).

Diaz Manufacturing’s long-term assets at the end of 2020 included net plant and equipment of $399.4 million and intangible and other assets of $450.0 million, as shown in Exhibit 3.1. The term net plant and equipment indicates that accumulated depreciation has been subtracted to arrive at the net value. That is, net plant and equipment equals total plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation; accumulated depreciation is the total amount of depreciation expense taken on plant and equipment up to the balance sheet date. For Diaz Manufacturing, net plant and equipment for 2020 is calculated as follows:

Accumulated Depreciation

When a firm acquires a tangible asset that deteriorates with use and wears out, accountants try to allocate the asset’s cost over its estimated useful life. The matching principle requires that the cost be expensed during the period in which the firm benefited from use of the asset. Thus, depreciation allocates the cost of a limited-life asset to the periods in which the firm is assumed to benefit from the asset. Tangible assets with an unlimited life, such as land, are not depreciated. Depreciation affects the balance sheet through the accumulated depreciation account; we discuss its effect on the income statement in Section 3.4.

depreciation the allocation of the cost of an asset over its estimated useful life to reflect the wear and tear on the asset as it is used to produce the firm’s goods and services

Management of a company can elect whether to depreciate its assets using straight-line depreciation or one of the approved accelerated depreciation methods. All of these methods allow the same amount of total depreciation over an asset’s life. However, accelerated depreciation methods allow for more depreciation expense in the early years of an asset’s life than straight-line depreciation.

Diaz Manufacturing uses the straight-line method of depreciation. Had Diaz elected to use accelerated depreciation, the value of its depreciable assets would have been written off to the income statement more quickly as a higher depreciation expense, which results in a lower net plant and equipment account on its balance sheet and a lower net income for the period.

Long-Term Liabilities

Long-term liabilities include debt instruments due and payable beyond one year as well as other long-term obligations of the firm. They include bonds, bank term loans, mortgages, and other types of liabilities, such as pension obligations and deferred compensation. Typically, firms finance long-term assets with long-term liabilities. Diaz Manufacturing has a single long-term liability of $574.0 million at the end of 2020, which is a long-term debt.

Equity
We have summarized the types of assets and liabilities that appear on the balance sheet. Now we look at the equity accounts. Diaz Manufacturing’s total stockholders’ equity at the end of 2020 is $937.4 million and is made up of four accounts—common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, and treasury stock—which we discuss next. We conclude with a discussion of preferred stock. Although a line item for preferred stock appears on Diaz Manufacturing’s balance sheets, the company has no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

The Common Stock Accounts

The most important equity accounts are those related to common stock, which represent the true ownership of the firm. Certain basic rights of ownership typically come with common stock; those rights are as follows:

The right to vote on corporate matters, such as the election of the board of directors or important actions such as the purchase of another company.
The preemptive right, which allows stockholders to purchase any additional shares of stock issued by the corporation in proportion to the number of shares they currently own. This allows common stockholders to retain the same percentage of ownership in the firm, if they choose to do so.
The right to receive cash dividends if they are paid.
If the firm is liquidated, the right to all remaining corporate assets after all creditors and preferred stockholders have been paid.
A common source of confusion is the number of different common stock accounts on the balance sheet, each of which identifies a source of the firm’s equity. The common stock account identifies the funding from equity investors that was used to start and maintain the business and is priced at a par value. The par value is an arbitrary number set by management, usually a nominal amount such as $1.

Clearly, par value has little to do with the market value of the stock when it is sold to investors. The additional paid-in capital is the amount of capital received from the sale of common stock in excess of par value. Thus, for example, if a new business is started with $40,000 from the sale of 1,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $1, the owners’ equity account looks as follows:

Common stock (1,000 shares @ $1 par value)	$ 1,000
Additional paid-in capital	39,000
Total paid-in capital	$40,000
Note the money put up by the initial investors: $1,000 in total par value (1,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $1) and $39,000 additional paid-in capital, for a total of $40,000.

As you can see in Exhibit 3.1, Diaz manufacturing has 54,566,054 shares of common stock with a par value of 91.63 cents, for a total value of $50.0 million (54,566,054 shares × 91.63 cents = $50 million). The additional paid-in capital is $842.9 million. Thus, Diaz’s total paid-in capital is $892.9 million ($50.0 million + $842.9 million = $892.9 million).

Retained Earnings

The retained earnings account represents earnings that have been retained and reinvested in the business over time rather than being paid out as cash dividends. The change in retained earnings from one period to the next can be computed as the difference between net income and dividends paid. Diaz Manufacturing’s retained earnings account is $67.8 million in 2020. Reading the annual report, we learn that in the recent past the company “wrote down” the value of a substantial amount of assets. This transaction, which will be discussed later in this chapter, reduced the size of the retained earnings account by reducing net income.

Note that retained earnings are not the same as cash. In fact, as we discuss in Section 3.7 of this chapter, a company can have a very large retained earnings account and no cash. Conversely, it can have a lot of cash and a very small retained earnings account. Because retained earnings appear on the liability side of the balance sheet, they do not represent an asset.

Treasury Stock

The treasury stock account represents stock that the firm has repurchased from investors. Publicly traded companies can simply buy shares of stock from stockholders on the market at the prevailing price. Typically, repurchased stock is held as “treasury stock,” and the firm can reissue it in the future if it desires. Diaz Manufacturing spent a total of $23.3 million during 2020 to repurchase the 571,320 shares of common stock it currently holds as treasury stock. The company has had a policy of repurchasing common stock, which has been subsequently reissued to senior executives under the firm’s stock-option plan.

treasury stock stock that the firm has repurchased from investors

You may wonder why a firm’s management would repurchase its own stock. This is a classic finance question, and it has no simple answer. One reason is that when a company has excess cash and management believes its stock price is undervalued, it makes sense to purchase stock with the cash. However, it is important to note that treasury stock is not an asset, and that firms cannot make profits on stock repurchases. We discuss share repurchases in more detail in Chapter 17.

Preferred Stock

Preferred stock is a cross between common stock and long-term debt. Preferred stock pays dividends at a specified fixed rate, which means that the firm cannot increase or decrease the dividend rate, regardless of whether the firm’s earnings increase or decrease. However, like common stock dividends, preferred stock dividends are declared by the board of directors, and in the event of financial distress, the board can elect not to pay a preferred stock dividend. If preferred stock dividends are not paid, the firm is typically required to pay dividends that have been skipped in the past before they can pay dividends to common stockholders. In the event of bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are paid before common stockholders but after bondholders and other creditors. As shown in Exhibit 3.1, Diaz Manufacturing has no preferred stock outstanding, but the company is authorized to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock.

3.3 Market Value versus Book Value
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe how market-value balance sheets differ from book-value balance sheets.
Although accounting statements are helpful to analysts and managers, they have a number of limitations. One of these limitations, mentioned earlier, is that accounting statements are historical—they are based on data such as the cost of a building that was built years ago. Thus, the value of assets on the balance sheet is generally what the firm paid for them and not their current market value—the amount they are worth today.

market value the price at which an item can be sold

Investors and management, however, care about how the company will do in the future. The best information concerning how much a company’s assets can earn in the future, as well as how much of a burden its liabilities are, comes from the current market value of those assets and liabilities. Accounting statements would therefore be more valuable if they measured current value. The process of recording assets at their current market value is often called marking to market.

In theory, everyone agrees that it is better to base financial statements on current information. Marking to market provides decision makers with financial statements that more closely reflect a company’s true financial condition; thus, they have a better chance of making the correct economic decision, given the information available. For example, providing current market values means that managers can no longer conceal a failing business or hide unrealized gains on assets.

On the downside, it can be difficult to identify the market value of an asset, particularly if there are few transactions involving comparable assets. Critics also point out that estimating market value can require complex financial modeling, and the resulting numbers can be open to manipulation and abuse. Finally, mark-to-market accounting can become inaccurate if market prices deviate from the “fundamental” values of assets and liabilities. This might occur because buyers and sellers have either incorrect information or overly optimistic or pessimistic expectations about the future.

A More Informative Balance Sheet
To illustrate why market value provides better economic information than book value, let’s revisit the balance sheet components discussed earlier. Our discussion will also help you understand why there can be such large differences between some book-value and market-value balance sheet accounts.

Assets

For current assets, market value and book value may be reasonably close. The reason is that current assets have a short life cycle and typically are converted into cash quickly. Then, as new current assets are added to the balance sheet, they are entered at their current market price.

In contrast, long-term assets, which are also referred to as fixed assets, have a long life cycle, and their market value and book value are not likely to be equal. In addition, if an asset is depreciable, the amount of depreciation shown on the balance sheet does not necessarily reflect the actual loss of economic value. As a general rule, the longer the time that has passed since an asset was acquired, the more likely it is that the current market value will differ from the book value.

For example, suppose a firm purchased land for a trucking depot in Atlanta, Georgia, 30 years ago for $100,000. Today the land is nestled in an expensive suburban area and is worth $5.5 million. The difference between the book value of $100,000 and the market value is $5.4 million.

Liabilities

The market value of liabilities can also differ from their book value, though typically by smaller amounts than is the case with assets. For liabilities, the balance sheet shows the amount of money that the company has promised to pay. This figure is generally close to the actual market value for short-term liabilities because of their relatively short maturities.

For long-term debt, however, book value and market value can differ substantially. The market value of debt with fixed interest payments is affected by the level of interest rates in the economy. More specifically, after long-term debt is issued, if the market rate of interest increases, the market value of the debt will decline. Conversely, if interest rates decline, the market value of the debt will increase. For example, assume that a firm has $1 million of 20-year bonds outstanding. If the market rate of interest increases from 5 to 8 percent, the price of the bonds will decline to around $700,000.5 Thus, changes in interest rates can have an important effect on the market values of long-term liabilities, such as corporate bonds. Even if interest rates do not change, the market value of long-term liabilities can change if the performance of the firm declines and the probability of default increases.

Stockholders’ Equity

The book value of the firm’s equity is one of the least informative items on the balance sheet. The book value of equity, as suggested earlier, is simply a historical record. As a result, it says very little about the current market value of the stockholders’ stake in the firm.

In contrast, on a balance sheet where both assets and liabilities are marked-to-market, the firm’s equity is more informative to management and investors. The difference between the market values of the assets and liabilities provides a better estimate of the market value of stockholders’ equity than the difference in the book values. Intuitively, this makes sense because if you know the true market values of the firm’s assets and liabilities, the difference must equal the market value of the stockholders’ equity.

You should be aware, however, that the difference between the sum of the market values of the individual assets and total liabilities will not give us an exact estimate of the market value of stockholders’ equity. The reason is that the total value of a firm’s assets depends on how these assets are utilized. By utilizing the assets efficiently, management can make the total value greater than the simple sum of the individual asset values. We will discuss this idea in more detail in Chapter 18.

Finally, if you know the market value of the stockholders’ equity and the number of shares of stock outstanding, it is easy to compute the stock price. Specifically, the price of a share of stock is the market value of the firm’s stockholders’ equity divided by the number of shares outstanding.

A Market-Value Balance Sheet
Let’s look at an example of how a market-value balance sheet can differ from a book-value balance sheet. Marvel Airline is a small regional carrier that has been serving the Northeast for five years. The airline has a fleet of short-haul jet aircraft, most of which were purchased over the past two years. The fleet has a book value of $600 million. Recently, the airline industry has suffered substantial losses in revenue due to the slump in travel resulting from COVID-19, and most carriers are projecting operating losses for the foreseeable future. As a result, the market value of Marvel’s aircraft fleet is only $400 million. The book value of Marvel’s long-term debt is $300 million, which is near its current market value. The firm has 100 million shares outstanding. Using these data, we can construct two balance sheets, one based on historical book values and the other based on market values:

 	Marvel Airlines
Book-Value versus Market-Value Balance Sheets ($ millions)
 	Assets	 	Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity
 	Book	Market	 	Book	Market
Aircraft	$600	$400	Long-term debt	$300	$300
 	 	 	Stockholders’ equity	300	100
Total	$600	$400	 	$600	$400
Based on the book-value balance sheet, the firm’s financial condition looks fine; the book value of Marvel’s aircraft at $600 million reflects what the firm paid, and the stockholders’ equity account is $300 million. But when we look at the market-value balance sheet, a different story emerges. We immediately see that the value of the aircraft has declined by $200 million and the stockholders’ equity has declined by $200 million!

Why the decline in stockholders’ equity? Recall that in Chapter 1 we argued that the value of any asset—stocks, bonds, or a firm—is determined by the future cash flows the asset will generate. At the time the aircraft were purchased, it was expected that they would generate a certain amount of cash flow over time. Now that hard times plague the industry, the cash flow expectations have been lowered, leading to a decline in the value of stockholders’ equity.

Learning by Doing Application 3.1 presents another example of a market-value balance sheet and what it tells us.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 3.1
The Market-Value Balance Sheet

Problem

Grady Means and his four partners in Menlo Park Consulting (MPC) have developed a revolutionary new continuous audit program that can monitor high-risk areas within a firm and identify abnormalities so that corrective actions can be taken. The partners have spent about $300,000 developing the program. The firm’s bookkeeper records the audit program on the firm’s balance sheet as an asset valued at cost, which is $300,000. To launch the product, the four partners recently invested an additional $1 million, and the money is currently in the firm’s bank account. At a recent trade show, a number of accounting and financial consulting firms tried to buy the new continuous product—the highest offer being $15 million. Assuming these are MPC’s only assets and liabilities, prepare the firm’s book-value and market-value balance sheets and explain the difference between the two.

3.4 The Income Statement and the Statement of Retained Earnings
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Identify the basic equation for the income statement and the information it provides.
In the previous sections, we examined a firm’s balance sheet, which is like a financial snapshot of the firm at a point in time. In contrast, the income statement illustrates the flow of operating activity and tells us how profitable a firm was between two points in time.

The Income Statement
The income statement summarizes the revenues, expenses, and profitability (or losses) of the firm over some period of time, usually a month, a quarter, or a year. The basic equation for the income statement can be expressed as follows:

(3.3)
income statement a financial statement that reports a firm’s revenues, expenses, and profits or losses over a period of time

Let’s look more closely at each element in this equation.

Revenues

A firm’s revenues (sales) arise from the products and services it creates through its business operations. For manufacturing and merchandising companies, revenues come from the sale of merchandise. Service companies, such as consulting firms, generate fees for the services they perform. Other kinds of businesses earn revenues by charging interest or collecting rent. Regardless of how they earn revenues, most firms either receive cash or create an account receivable for each transaction.

Expenses

Expenses are the various costs that the firm incurs to generate revenues. Broadly speaking, expenses are (1) the value of long-term assets consumed through business operations, such as depreciation expense, and (2) the costs incurred in conducting business, such as labor, utilities, materials, and taxes.

Net Income

The firm’s net income reflects its accomplishments (revenues) relative to its efforts (expenses) during a time period. If revenues exceed expenses, the firm generates net income for the period. If expenses exceed revenues, the firm has a net loss. Net income is often referred to as profits, as income, or simply as the “bottom line,” since it is the last item on the income statement. Net income is often reported on a per-share basis and is then called earnings per share (EPS), where EPS equals net income divided by the number of common shares outstanding. A firm’s earnings per share tell a stockholder how much the firm has earned (or lost) for each share of stock outstanding.

earnings per share (EPS) net income divided by the number of common shares outstanding

Income statements for Diaz Manufacturing for 2019 and 2020 are shown in Exhibit 3.2. You can see that in 2020 total revenues from all sources (net sales) were $1,563.7 million. Total expenses for producing and selling those goods were $1,445.2 million—the total of the amounts for cost of goods sold, selling and administrative expenses, depreciation, interest expense, and taxes.6

EXHIBIT 3.2 Diaz Manufacturing Income Statements for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31 ($ millions)

The income statement shows the sales, expenses, and profit earned by the firm over a specific period of time.

 	2020	2019
Net salesa	$1,563.7	$1,386.7
Cost of goods sold	1,081.1	974.8
Selling and administrative expenses	231.1	197.4

Depreciation and amortization	83.1	75.3
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)	$168.4	$139.2
Interest expense	5.6	18.0
Earnings before taxes (EBT)	$162.8	$121.2
Taxes	44.3	16.1
Net income	$118.5	$105.1

Cash flow from operating activity per share (CFPS)	$3.80	$3.60
aNet sales is defined as total sales less all sales discounts and sales returns and allowances.

Using Equation 3.3, we can use these numbers to calculate Diaz Manufacturing’s net income for the year:

Since Diaz Manufacturing had 54,566,054 common shares outstanding at year’s end, its EPS was $2.17 per share ($118.5 million/54,566,054 shares = $2.17 per share).

A Closer Look at Some Expense Categories

Next, we take a closer look at some of the expense items on the income statement. We discussed depreciation earlier in relation to the balance sheet, and we now look at the role of depreciation expense in the income statement.

Depreciation Expense
An interesting feature of financial reporting is that companies are allowed to prepare two sets of financial statements: one for tax purposes and one for financial reporting to the SEC and investors. For tax purposes, most firms elect to accelerate depreciation as quickly as is permitted under the tax code. The reason is that accelerated depreciation results in a higher depreciation expense to the income statement, which in turn results in a lower earnings before taxes (EBT) and a lower tax liability in the first few years after the asset is acquired. The good news about accelerating depreciation for tax purposes is that the firm pays lower taxes but the depreciation expense does not represent a cash flow. In contrast, straight-line depreciation results in lower depreciation expenses to the income statement, which results in higher EBT and higher tax payments. Firms generally use straight-line depreciation in the financial statements they report to the SEC and investors because it makes their earnings look better. The higher a firm’s EBT, the higher its net income.

It is important to understand that, as we noted earlier, the company does not take more total depreciation under accelerated depreciation methods than under the straight-line method; the total amount of depreciation expensed to the income statement over the life of an asset is the same. Total depreciation cannot exceed the price paid for the asset. Note that the depreciation method does not aﬀect the cost of the asset and accelerating depreciation only alters the timing of when the depreciation is expensed.

Amortization Expense
Amortization is the process of writing off expenses for intangible assets—such as patents, licenses, copyrights, and trademarks—over their useful life. Since depreciation and amortization are very similar, they are often lumped together on the income statement. Both are noncash expenses, which means that an expense is recorded on the income statement, but the associated cash does not necessarily leave the firm in that period. For Diaz Manufacturing, the depreciation and amortization expense for 2020 was $83.1 million.

At one time, goodwill was one of the intangible assets subject to amortization. Beginning in June 2001, however, goodwill could no longer be amortized. The value of the goodwill on a firm’s balance sheet is now subject to an annual impairment test. This test requires that the company annually value the businesses that were acquired in the past to see if the value of the goodwill associated with those businesses has declined below the value at which it is being carried on the balance sheet. If the value of the goodwill has declined (been impaired), management must expense the amount of the impairment. This expense reduces the firm’s reported net income.

Unusual or Nonrecurring Items
Other items reported separately in the income statement, or in footnotes to the income statement, include unusual or nonrecurring items. These are amounts that can affect the reported profit but are typically unrelated to the firm’s regular operating activities. For example, in 2019 MGM Resorts sold its Bellagio Casino and reported a $2.67 billion dollar gain on the deal. In contrast, at the end of 2019, Equifax Inc. reported a cost of just over $800 million associated with legal proceedings and government investigations related to an earlier cybersecurity breach. Providing the detail of irregular or unusual items allows users of financial statements to better understand the nature of revenues, expenses, and profits for firms from their regular day-to-day operations. Diaz Manufacturing had no unusual or nonrecurring expense items during 2020.

Step by Step to the Bottom Line

You probably noticed in Exhibit 3.2 that Diaz Manufacturing’s income statement showed income at several intermediate steps before reaching net income, the so-called bottom line. These intermediate income figures, which are typically included on a firm’s income statement, provide important information about the firm’s performance and help identify what factors are driving the firm’s income or losses.

EBITDA
The first intermediate income figure is EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The importance of EBITDA is that it shows what is earned purely from operations and reflects how efficiently the firm can manufacture and sell its products without taking into account the cost of the productive asset base (plant and equipment and intangible assets). For Diaz Manufacturing, EBITDA was $251.5 million in 2020.

EBIT
Subtracting depreciation and amortization from EBITDA yields the next intermediate figure, EBIT, or earnings before interest and taxes. EBIT for Diaz Manufacturing was $168.4 million in 2020.

EBT
When interest expense is subtracted from EBIT, the result is EBT, or earnings before taxes. Diaz Manufacturing had EBT of $162.8 million in 2020.

Net Income
Finally, taxes are subtracted from EBT to arrive at net income. For Diaz Manufacturing, as we have already seen, net income in 2020 was $118.5 million.

In Chapter 4 you will see how to use these intermediate income figures to evaluate the firm’s financial condition. Next, we look at the statement of retained earnings, which provides detailed information about how management allocated the $118.5 million of net income earned during the period.

The Statement of Retained Earnings
Corporations often prepare a statement of retained earnings, which identifies the changes in the retained earnings account from one accounting period to the next. During any accounting period, two events can affect the retained earnings account balance:

When the firm reports net income or loss.
When the board of directors declares and pays a cash dividend.
EXHIBIT 3.3 Diaz Manufacturing Statement of Retained Earnings for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2020 ($ millions)

The statement of retained earnings accompanies the balance sheet and shows the beginning balance of retained earnings, the adjustments made to retained earnings during the year, and the ending balance.

Balance of retained earnings, December 31, 2019	$ (50.7)
Add: Net income, 2020	118.5
Less: Dividends to common stockholders, 2020	—
Balance of retained earnings, December 31, 2020	$ 67.8
Exhibit 3.3 shows the activity in the retained earnings account for 2020 for Diaz Manufacturing. The beginning balance is a negative $50.7 million. The firm’s annual report explains that the retained earnings deficit resulted from a $441 million write-down of assets that occurred when Diaz Manufacturing became a stand-alone business in June 2016. As reported in the 2020 income statement (Exhibit 3.2), the firm earned $118.5 million that year, and the board of directors elected not to declare any dividends. Retained earnings consequently went from a negative $50.7 million to a positive balance of $67.8 million, an increase of $118.5 million.

3.5 The Statement of Cash Flows
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Understand the calculation of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities required in the statement of cash flows.
There are times when the financial manager wants to know the details of all the cash inflows and outflows that have taken place during the year and to reconcile the beginning-of-year and end-of-year cash balances. The reason for the focus on cash flows is very practical. Managers must have a complete understanding of the uses of cash and the sources of cash in the firm. Firms must have the cash to pay wages, suppliers, and other creditors, and they often elect to defer cash receipts from sales by providing credit to customers. Managers may also decide to issue new securities to raise cash or may retire existing liabilities or repurchase equity to use cash. Finally, the purchase and sale of long-term productive assets can have a measurable impact on a firm’s cash position. In sum, managers are responsible for a wide variety of transactions that involve sources and uses of cash over an accounting period. The statement of cash flows provides them with what amounts to an inventory of these transactions, and helps them understand why the cash balance changed as it did from the beginning to the end of the period.

Sources and Uses of Cash
The statement of cash flows shows the company’s cash inflows (receipts) and cash outflows (payments and investments) for a period of time. We derive these cash flows by looking at the firm’s net income during the period and at changes in balance sheet accounts from the beginning of the period (end of the previous period) to the end of the period. In analyzing the statement of cash flows, it is important to understand that changes in the balance sheet accounts reflect cash flows. More specifically, increases in assets or decreases in liabilities and equity are uses of cash, while decreases in assets or increases in liabilities and equity are sources of cash. These changes in balance sheet items can be summarized by the following:

Working capital. An increase in current assets (such as accounts receivable and inventory) is a use of cash. For example, if a firm increases its inventory, it must use cash to purchase the additional inventory. Conversely, the sale of inventory increases a firm’s cash position. An increase in current liabilities (such as accounts or notes payable) is a source of cash. For example, if during the year a firm increases its accounts payable, it has effectively borrowed money from suppliers and increased its cash position.
Fixed assets. An increase in long-term fixed assets is a use of cash. If a company purchases fixed assets during the year, it decreases cash because it must use cash to pay for the purchase. If the firm sells a fixed asset during the year, the firm’s cash position will increase.
Long-term liabilities and equity. An increase in long-term debt (bonds and private placement debt) or equity (common and preferred stock) is a source of cash. The retirement of debt or the purchase of treasury stock requires the firm to pay out cash, reducing its cash balance.
Dividends. Any cash dividend payment decreases a firm’s cash balance.

Organization of the Statement of Cash Flows

The statement of cash flows is organized around three business activities—operating activities, long-term investing activities, and financing activities—and the reconciliation of the cash account. We next discuss each element and illustrate them with reference to the statement of cash flows for Diaz Manufacturing, which is shown in Exhibit 3.4.

Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities in the statement of cash flows are the net cash flows that are related to a firm’s principal business activities. The most important items are the firm’s net income, depreciation and amortization expense, and working capital accounts (other than cash and short-term debt obligations, which are classified elsewhere).

In Exhibit 3.4, the first section of the statement of cash flows for Diaz Manufacturing shows the cash flow from operations. The section starts with the firm’s net income of $118.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2020. Depreciation expense ($83.1 million) is added because it is a noncash expense on the income statement.

Next come changes in the firm’s working capital accounts that affect operating activities. Note that working capital accounts that involve financing (bank loans and notes payable) and cash reconciliation (cash and marketable securities) will be classified separately. For Diaz, the working capital accounts that are sources of cash are (1) increase in accounts payable of $24.3 million ($349.3 − $325.0 = $24.3), (2) decrease in other current assets of $8.6 million ($29.9 − $21.3 = $8.6), and (3) increase in accrued income taxes of $1.2 million ($18.0 − $16.8 = $1.2). Changes in working capital items that are uses of cash are (1) increase in accounts receivable of $37.4 million ($306.2 − $268.8 = $37.4) and (2) increase in inventory of $51.1 million ($423.8 − $372.7 = $51.1). The total cash provided to the firm from operations is $147.2 million.

To clarify why changes in working capital accounts affect the statement of cash flows, let’s look at some of the changes. Diaz had a $37.4 million increase in accounts receivable, which is subtracted from net income as a use of cash because the number represents sales that were included in the income statement but for which no cash has been collected. Diaz provided financing for these sales to its customers. Similarly, the $24.3 million increase in accounts payable represents a source of cash because goods and services the company purchased have been received but no cash has been paid out.

Long-Term Investing Activities
Cash flows from long-term investing activities relate to the buying and selling of long-term assets. In Exhibit 3.4, the second section shows the cash flows from long-term investing activities. Diaz Manufacturing made long-term investments in two areas: (1) the purchase of plant and equipment, totaling $88.3 million ($911.6 − $823.3 = $88.3) and (2) an increase in goodwill and other assets of $38.4 million ($450.0 − $411.6 = $38.4). Thus, Diaz’s investments in property, equipment, and other assets resulted in a cash outflow of $126.7 million ($88.3 + $38.4 = $126.7).

aCash includes investments in marketable securities.

Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing occur when cash is obtained from or repaid to creditors or owners (stockholders). Typical financing activities involve cash received from the issuance of common or preferred stock, as well as cash from bank loans, notes payable, and long-term debt. Cash payments of dividends to stockholders and cash purchases of treasury stock reduce a company’s cash position.

Diaz Manufacturing’s financing activities include the sale of bonds for $268.4 million ($574.0 − $305.6 = $268.4), which is a source of cash, and the purchase of treasury stock for $23.3 million, which is a use of cash. The firm’s notes payable position also increased by $6.3 million ($10.5 − $4.2 = $6.3). Overall, Diaz had a net cash inflow from financing activities of $251.4 million.

Cash Reconciliation
The final part of the statement of cash flows is a reconciliation of the firm’s beginning and ending cash positions. For Diaz Manufacturing, these cash positions are shown on the 2019 and 2020 balance sheets. The first step in reconciling the company’s beginning and ending cash positions is to add together the amounts from the first three sections of the statement of cash flows: (1) the net cash inflows from operations of $147.2 million, (2) the net cash outflow from long-term investment activities of −$126.7 million, (3) and the net cash inflow from financing activities of $251.4 million. Together, these three items represent a total net increase in cash to the firm of $271.9 million ($147.2 − $126.7 + $251.4 = $271.9). Finally, we add this amount ($271.9 million) to the beginning cash balance of $16.6 million to obtain the ending cash balance for 2020 of $288.5 million ($271.9 + $16.6 = $288.5).

3.6 Tying Together the Financial Statements
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain how the four major financial statements discussed in this chapter are related.
Up to this point, we have treated a firm’s financial statements as if they were independent of one another. As you might suspect, though, the four financial statements presented in this chapter are related. Let’s see how.

Recall that the balance sheet summarizes what assets the firm has at a particular point in time and how the firm has financed those assets with debt and equity. From one year to the next, the firm’s balance sheet will change because the firm will buy or sell assets and the dollar value of the debt and equity financing will change. These changes are exactly the ones presented in the statement of cash flows. In other words, the statement of cash flows is a summary of the changes in a firm’s balance sheet from the beginning of a period to the end of that period.

This concept is illustrated in Exhibit 3.5, which presents summaries of the four financial statements for Diaz Manufacturing for the year 2020. The exhibit also presents the balance sheet for the beginning of that year, which is dated December 31, 2019. If you compare the changes in the balance sheet numbers from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, you can see that these changes are in fact summarized in the statement of cash flows. For example, the change in the cash balance of $271.9 million ($288.5 − $16.6 = $271.9) appears at the bottom of the statement of cash flows. Similarly, excluding cash and notes payable, the change in net working capital from the beginning to the end of 2020 is $54.4 million, which is calculated as follows: [($751.3 − $367.3) − ($671.4 − $341.8)] = ($384.0 − $329.6) = $54.4.7 This number is equal to the net working capital investment reflected in the statement of cash flows. Note, too, that the net working capital investment in Diaz’s statement of cash flows is just the total change in the firm’s investment in the following working capital accounts: accounts payable, other current assets, accrued income taxes, accounts receivable, and inventories. You can also see in Exhibit 3.5 that the change in fixed assets, which includes net property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, and other long-term assets, is $43.6 million ($849.4 − $805.8 = $43.6). This number is equal to the sum of the cash flows from investing activities and depreciation and amortization, −$126.7 + $83.1 = −$43.6, in the statement of cash flows. We add depreciation to investing activities in the latter calculation because the fixed asset accounts in the balance sheet are net of depreciation.

EXHIBIT 3.5 The Interrelations among the Financial Statements: Illustrated Using Diaz Manufacturing Financial Results ($ millions) The statement of cash flows ties together the income statement with the balance sheets from the beginning and the end of the period. The statement of retained earnings shows how the retained earnings account has changed from the beginning to the end of the period.


Turning to the liability and equity side of the balance sheet, notice the change in the amount of debt plus equity that the firm has sold in 2020, which is represented by the sum of the long-term liabilities and notes and capital stock in the balance sheet. This sum equals the value of the financing activities in the statement of cash flows. The change in the balance sheet values is calculated as follows: [($584.5 + $869.6) − ($309.8 + $892.9)] = ($1,454.1 − $1,202.7) = $251.4 million.8 Finally, since Diaz did not pay a dividend in 2020, the change in retained earnings of $118.5 million [$67.8 − (−$50.7) = $118.5] exactly equals the company’s net income, which appears on the top line of the statement of cash flows.

Again, the important point here is that the statement of cash flows summarizes the changes in the balance sheet. How do the other financial statements fit into the picture? Well, the income statement calculates the firm’s net income, which is used to calculate the retained earnings at the end of the year and is included as the first line in the statement of cash flows. The income statement provides an input that is used in the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows. The statement of retained earnings just summarizes the changes to the retained earnings account a little differently than the statement of cash flows. This different format makes it simpler for managers and investors to see why retained earnings changed as it did.

Explain how the four financial statements are related.
3.7 Cash Flow to Investors
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Identify the cash flow to a firm’s investors using its financial statements.
As we discussed in Chapter 1, the concept of cash flow is very important in corporate finance. Financial managers are concerned with maximizing the value of stockholders’ shares, which means making decisions that maximize the value of the cash flows that stockholders can expect to receive. Similarly, the firm has interest and principal obligations to its debt holders that must be met. It is important to recognize that the revenues, expenses, and net income reported in a firm’s income statement provide an incomplete picture of the cash flows available to its investors.

Net Income versus the Cash Flow to Investors
Managers and investors are primarily interested in a firm’s ability to generate cash flows to meet the firm’s obligations to its debt holders and that can be distributed to stockholders. These cash obligations and distributions include interest payments and the repayment of principal to the firm’s debt holders, as well as distributions of cash to its stockholders in the form of dividends or stock repurchases. Cash flow to investors is the cash flow that a firm generates for its investors in a given period (cash receipts less cash payments and investments), excluding cash inflows from investors themselves, such as from the sale of new equity or long-term interest-bearing debt.

cash flow to investors the cash flow that a firm generates for its investors in a given period, excluding cash inflows from the sale of securities to investors

So how is cash flow to investors different from net income? One significant difference arises because accountants do not necessarily count the cash coming into the firm and the cash going out when they prepare financial statements. Under GAAP, accountants recognize revenue at the time a sale is substantially completed, not when the customer actually pays the firm. In addition, because of the matching principle, accountants match revenues with the costs of producing those revenues regardless of whether these are cash costs to the firm during that period.9 Finally, cash flows for capital expenditures occur at the time that an asset is purchased, not when it is expensed through depreciation and amortization. As a result of these accounting rules, there can be a substantial difference between the time when revenues and expenses are recorded and when cash is actually collected (in the case of revenue) or paid (in the case of expenses).

Cash flow to investors is one of the most important concepts in finance, as it identifies the cash flow in a given period that is available to meet the firm’s obligations to its debt holders and that can be distributed to its stockholders. This, in turn, defines the value of their investments in the firm. The cash flow to investors is calculated as the cash flow to investors from operating activity, minus the cash flow invested in net working capital, minus the cash flow invested in long-term assets.

Cash Flow to Investors from Operating Activity

Accounting profits can be converted into cash flow to investors from operating activity by subtracting the taxes that the firm paid during the period from earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and adding back all of the firm’s noncash expenses. This calculation results in a number that is different from the net cash provided by operating activities that is reported in the statement of cash flows because it does not include cash flows associated with working capital accounts. Unlike the statement of cash flows, when we calculate cash flow to investors, we compute cash flows associated with net working capital separately. We also start from EBIT rather than net income, since interest paid to debt holders has been deducted in the net income calculation and we want to include it in cash flow to investors. Cash flow to investors from operating activity (CFOA) can be formally written as:

(3.4)
For most businesses, the largest noncash expenses are depreciation and amortization of long-term assets. These are noncash expenses because they are deducted from revenues on the income statement during the years after a long-term asset was purchased, even though no cash is actually being paid out. The cash outflow took place when the asset was purchased. Other noncash items include the following:

Depletion charges, which are like depreciation but apply to extractive natural resources, such as crude oil, natural gas, timber, and mineral deposits (noncash expense).
Deferred taxes, which are the portion of a firm’s income tax expense that is postponed because of differences in the accounting policies adopted for financial reporting and for tax reporting (noncash expense).
Expenses that were paid in cash in a previous period (prepaid expenses), such as for rent and insurance (noncash expense).
Revenues previously received as cash but not yet earned (deferred revenues). An example of deferred revenue would be prepaid magazine subscriptions to a publishing company that are recorded as revenue in a period after the cash has been paid (noncash revenue).
We can use the data from Diaz Manufacturing’s 2020 income statement in Exhibit 3.2 to illustrate the calculation of CFOA. If the company had no deferred taxes and the taxes reported in the income statement equal the taxes actually paid by the firm, Diaz’s CFOA in 2020 was:

Decision Making Example 3.1 presents another illustration of the CFOA concepts.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 3.1
Cash Flow to Investors from Operating Activity

Situation

You are a financial manager at Bonivo Corporation and are preparing a report for senior management. You have asked two analysts who work for you to compute cash flow to investors from operating activity during the year that just ended. A short while later, they come to your office and report that they cannot agree on how to do the calculation.

The first analyst thinks it should be computed as:

Net income
+ Depreciation and amortization
+ Increase in accounts payable
+ Increase in accrued income taxes
− Increase in accounts receivable
− Increase in inventories
− Increase in other current assets
= Cash flow to investors from operating activity
The second analyst proposes that the calculation is:

EBIT
− Current taxes
+ Depreciation and amortization
= Cash flow to investors from operating activity
Which calculation should you use for your report to senior management?



Cash Flow Invested in Net Working Capital

As we discussed in Section 3.5, changes in current assets and liabilities from one period to the next represent sources and uses of cash. When we calculate the cash flow to investors, we account for these sources and uses by computing the change in net working capital during the period. This change takes into account all the money that has been invested in current assets, including cash and marketable securities, accounts receivable and inventories, and all of the financing that has been received from current liabilities, such as accounts payable and notes payable, during the period. These sources and uses all directly affect the cash flow that is available to investors during the period.

Recall from Equation 3.2 that a firm’s investment in net working capital (NWC) at any point in time can be computed as the difference between its total current assets and total current liabilities:

We saw earlier that Diaz Manufacturing’s investment in NWC at the end of 2020 was:

The corresponding value at the end of 2019 was:

As is the case with all balance sheet items, the investment in NWC is a snapshot at a point in time. To determine the flow of cash into, or out of, working capital we compute the cash flow invested in net working capital (CFNWC). This equals the difference between NWC at the end of the current period and NWC at the end of the previous period:

(3.5)
For Diaz Manufacturing, CFNWC is:

The positive difference between Diaz Manufacturing’s net working capital in 2020 and 2019 indicates that current assets increased by $320.0 million more than current liabilities during 2020. This net investment in NWC reduced the amount of cash that might otherwise have been available for distribution to the Diaz investors in 2020. Of course, investments in NWC are likely to yield positive cash flows in the future. For example, accounts receivable can be collected, and inventories will eventually be sold. Also, selling items on credit or having a greater stock of finished inventories can help the company attract new customers. For Diaz Manufacturing, the single largest investment in working capital is the addition of $271.9 million to cash and marketable securities. We will discuss reasons why firms make investments in cash in Chapter 14.

Cash Flow Invested in Long-Term Assets

Long-term assets, such as land, buildings, and plant and equipment, represent a large portion of the total assets of many firms. Because the purchases and sales of such assets can have a substantial impact on the cash flow to investors, it is very important that we account for them in our cash flow calculations. If a firm is a net investor (buys more than it sells) in long-term assets during a given year, its cash flow to investors will be reduced by the amount of the net purchases. If the firm is a net seller of long-term assets, its cash flow to investors will increase by the value of the net sales.

As we discussed earlier, Diaz Manufacturing had $911.6 million invested in plant and equipment and $450.0 million invested in goodwill and other assets at the end of 2020 (Exhibit 3.1). The company’s total investment in long-term assets at the end of 2020 was therefore $911.6 million + $450.0 million = $1,361.6 million. The corresponding value at the end of 2019 was $823.3 million + $411.6 million = $1,234.9 million. As with investments in net working capital, we use the change in the value of the long-term assets to compute the amount that a firm invested in long-term investments during a period. Specifically, the cash flow invested in long-term assets (CFLTA) is computed as:

(3.6)
It is very important to remember that, since depreciation is a noncash charge, we ignore accumulated depreciation when we compute the effects of investment in long-term assets on cash flow to investors. For Diaz Manufacturing, CFLTA in 2020 was:

where the $1,361.6 million and $1,234.9 million values represent the long-term asset values before accumulated depreciation. This calculation indicates that Diaz Manufacturing invested a total of $126.7 million in long-term assets during 2020. Of this total, $88.3 million ($911.6 − $823.3 = $88.3) was invested in plant and equipment and $38.4 million ($450 − $411.6 = $38.4) was invested in goodwill and other assets. Like investments in net working capital, investments in long-term assets are likely to generate positive cash flows in the future but reduce the cash flow to investors in the current period.

Learning by Doing Application 3.2 illustrates another CFNWC and CFLTA calculation.

Alexi Ghosh and Paul Heaton are the founding partners of BitByte Inc., a leading developer of application delivery management software and solutions. Since opening for business in 2017, BitByte’s revenue has nearly tripled. The partners would like to know more about how much cash flow the firm is investing in net working capital and long-term assets to facilitate this growth. While the firm has no inventory for software development, it has increasingly relied on accounts receivable as a term of sale. In addition, growth has required additional investment in long-term assets such as computing hardware, networking equipment, and facilities. Using the information in the following financial statements, calculate the cash flow invested in net working capital and the cash flow invested in long-term assets during fiscal year 2020 for BitByte Inc.

Cash Flow to Investors: Putting It All Together
Having calculated the cash flow from operating activity, cash flow invested in net working capital, and cash flow invested in long-term assets, we are now ready to compute cash flow to investors (CFI). We use Equation 3.7 to do this:

(3.7)
Note that in this calculation, CFNWC and CFLTA are subtracted from CFOA because investments in both net working capital and long-term assets reduce the cash flow available to investors. Of course, it is possible for either or both of these figures to be negative in a given period. For example, CFLTA will be negative if proceeds for the sale of long-term assets exceed total investments in these assets.

Putting this all together for Diaz Manufacturing, we can see that the company’s CFI in 2020 was:

The negative value indicates that Diaz invested more cash than was produced by its operating activity during 2020. This is not uncommon for a rapidly growing company like Diaz, which experienced a net sales increase of almost 13 percent from 2019 to 2020. Fast-growing firms often must invest more cash than they generate. The difference is financed by selling stock to investors or by borrowing money. In such situations, both the old and new investors are counting on the firm to produce cash flows in the future that will compensate them for the investment that they are making now. A brief look at the liability side of the Diaz balance sheet suggests that the negative cash flow to investors was funded largely by issuing new long-term debt.

3.8 Federal Income Tax
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss the difference between average and marginal tax rates.
We conclude this chapter with a discussion of corporate income taxes. Taxes take a big bite out of the income of most businesses and represent one of their largest cash outflows. For example, as shown in the income statement for Diaz Manufacturing (Exhibit 3.2), the firm’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2020 amounted to $168.4 million, and its tax bill was $44.3 million, or 26.3 percent of EBIT ($44.3/$168.4 = 0.263, or 26.3 percent)—not a trivial amount by any standard. Because of their magnitude, taxes play a critical role in most business financial decisions.

As you might suspect, corporations spend a considerable amount of effort and money employing tax specialists to find legal ways to minimize their tax burdens. The tax laws are complicated, continually changing, and at times seemingly bizarre—in part because the tax code is not an economically rational document; rather, it reflects the changing and sometimes conflicting political and social values of Congress and the president over time. Corporations must also make sure they pay any state taxes that they owe.

If you work in the finance or accounting area, a tax specialist will advise you on the tax implications of most decisions in which you will be involved as a businessperson. Consequently, we will not try here to make you a tax expert, but we will present a high-level view of the major portions of the federal tax code that have a significant impact on business decision making.

Corporate Income Tax Rates
In 2017 a new federal law, H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, introduced major changes to the federal tax code. While we discuss a number of the implications of H.R. 1. in Appendix C, one of the most significant changes for corporations (C-Corps) was the introduction of a single or “flat” tax rate of 21 percent on taxable income. Beginning in 2018, the new flat tax replaced the previous progressive corporate income tax rates, under which higher levels of income were taxed at different rates.

It is important to note that many state and local taxes are still determined using progressive tax rates. This means that corporate income will continue to be subject to varying “blended” marginal tax rates that are determined by the combined application of federal, state, and local tax rates.

To simplify calculations throughout the book, we will generally specify a single tax rate for a corporation, such as 29 percent. The rate may include payments for state and local taxes, which will make the total tax rate the firm pays greater than the federal rate.

Average versus Marginal Tax Rates
The average tax rate is simply the total taxes paid divided by taxable income. In contrast, the marginal tax rate is the tax rate that is paid on the next dollar of income earned. When you are making investment decisions, the relevant tax rate to use is usually the marginal tax rate. The reason is that new investments (projects) are expected to generate new cash flows, which will be taxed at the firm’s marginal tax rate. As a result, it is important to consider any difference between the average tax rate and the marginal tax rate in financial decision making. The current flat tax rate of 21 percent for C-Corps means that for federal taxes the marginal and average rate are a constant 21 percent.

average tax rate total taxes paid divided by taxable income

marginal tax rate the tax rate paid on the next dollar of income earned

A simple example will show that under the current tax rules the firm’s average and marginal federal tax rates are the same. Suppose that the Zippy Corporation has taxable income of $150,000. Using a flat tax rate of 21 percent, what is the firm’s federal tax liability? What are the firm’s average and marginal federal tax rates?

Zippy Corporation’s total federal liability is computed as follows:

The average federal tax rate is equal to the total federal taxes divided by the total taxable income, which is $31,500/$150,000 = 0.21, or 21 percent. The marginal federal tax rate is the tax rate paid on the last dollar earned which, because there is currently a flat federal tax rate, is also 0.21, or 21 percent.

Let’s look at a simplified example of “blended” federal and state taxes to see that there can be a difference between average and marginal rates. Suppose that Zippy Corporation’s total federal taxes are the $31,500 we calculated above, but the company is located in a state where companies are required to pay progressive state taxes at a rate of 0.06, or 6 percent, on taxable income up to $100,000 and a rate of 0.08, or 8 percent, on taxable income over $100,000.10

The company’s state tax liability is computed as 0.06 × $100,000 = $6,000 for the first $100,000 of taxable income plus 0.08 × ($150,000 − $100,000) = $4,000 on the amount above $100,000, for total state taxes of $10,000 ($6,000 + $4,000 = $10,000). Adding this to the federal taxes of $31,500 gives a total state and federal tax amount of $41,500 ($10,000 + $31,500 = $41,500).

Zippy Corporation’s “blended” federal and state average tax rate is equal to the total state and federal taxes divided by the total taxable income, which is $41,500/$150,000 = 0.277, or 27.7 percent. The blended marginal tax rate is the tax rate paid on the last dollar earned. For Zippy Corporation, this is 0.29, or 29 percent. The blended marginal rate is the 0.21, or 21 percent, federal tax rate plus the 0.08, or 8 percent, state tax rate (0.21 + 0.08 = 0.29, or 29 percent). We use the higher 8 percent state rate as that is Zippy Corporation’s tax rate on taxable income above $100,000.

Learning by Doing Application 3.3 presents another example of the tax calculations for a firm.

Unequal Treatment of Dividends and Interest Payments
An interesting anomaly in the U.S. tax code is the unequal treatment of interest and dividend payments. For C-corporations (discussed in Chapter 1), interest paid on debt obligations is a tax-deductible business expense. Dividends paid to common or preferred stockholders are not deductible, however.

Average and Marginal Tax Rates

Problem

Snappy Corporation has taxable income of $90,000. If the federal tax rate is a flat 21 percent, what is the firm’s federal tax liability? What are the firm’s average and marginal federal tax rates?





The unequal treatment of interest and dividend payments is not without consequences. In effect, it lowers the cost of debt financing compared with the cost of an equal amount of common or preferred stock financing. Thus, there is a tax-induced bias toward the use of debt financing, which we discuss more thoroughly in later chapters.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Discuss generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and their importance to the economy.

GAAP are a set of authoritative guidelines that define accounting practices at a particular point in time. The principles determine the rules for how a company maintains its accounting system and how it prepares financial statements. Accounting standards are important because without them each firm could develop its own unique accounting practices. This would make it difficult for anyone to monitor the firm’s true performance or compare the performance of different firms. The result would be a loss of confidence in the accounting system and the financial reports it produces. Fundamental accounting principles include arm’s-length transactions, the cost principle, the realization principle, the matching principle, and the going concern assumption.

2 Explain the balance sheet identity and why a balance sheet must balance.

A balance sheet provides a summary of a firm’s financial position at a particular point in time. It identifies the current assets that a firm has and the productive assets that it uses to generate income, as well as the sources of funding from creditors (liabilities) and owners (stockholders’ equity) that were used to buy the assets. The balance sheet identity is Total assets = Total liabilities + Total stockholders’ equity. Stockholders’ equity represents ownership in the firm and is the residual claim of the owners after all other obligations to creditors, employees, and vendors have been paid. The balance sheet must always balance because the owners get what is left over after all creditors have been paid—that is, Total stockholders’ equity = Total assets − Total liabilities.

3 Describe how market-value balance sheets differ from book-value balance sheets.

Book value is the amount a firm paid for its assets at the time of purchase. The current market value of an asset is the amount that a firm would receive for the asset if it were sold on the open market (not in a forced liquidation). Most managers and investors are more concerned about what a firm’s assets can earn in the future than about what the assets cost in the past. Thus, marked-to-market balance sheets are more helpful in showing a company’s true financial condition than balance sheets based on historical costs. The reason that marked-to-market balance sheets are not commonly used is that it is difficult to estimate market values for some assets and liabilities.

4 Identify the basic equation for the income statement and the information it provides.

An income statement presents a firm’s profit or loss for a period of time, usually a month, quarter, or year. The income statement identifies the major sources of revenues generated by the firm and the corresponding expenses needed to generate those revenues. The equation for the income statement is Net income = Revenues − Expenses. If revenues exceed expenses, the firm generates a net profit for the period. If expenses exceed revenues, the firm generates a net loss. Net profit or net income is the most comprehensive accounting measure of a firm’s performance.

5 Understand the calculation of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities required in the statement of cash flows.

Cash flows from operating activities in the statement of cash flows are the net cash flows that are related to a firm’s principal business activities. The most important items are the firm’s net income, depreciation and amortization expense, and working capital accounts (other than cash and short-term debt obligations, which are classified elsewhere). Cash flows from long-term investing activities relate to the buying and selling of long-term assets. Cash flows from financing occur when cash is obtained from or repaid to creditors or owners (stockholders). Typical financing activities involve cash received from the issuance of common or preferred stock, as well as cash from bank loans, other notes payable, and long-term debt. Cash payments of dividends to stockholders and cash purchases of treasury stock reduce a company’s cash position.

6 Explain how the four major financial statements discussed in this chapter are related.

The four financial statements discussed in the chapter are the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of retained earnings, and the statement of cash flows. The key financial statement that ties together the other three statements is the statement of cash flows, which summarizes changes in the balance sheet from the beginning of the year to the end. These changes reflect the information in the income statement and in the statement of retained earnings.

7 Identify the cash flow to a firm’s investors using its financial statements.

Cash flow to investors is the cash flow that a firm generates in a given period (cash receipts less cash payments and investments), excluding cash inflows from new equity sales or long-term debt issues. Cash flow to investors is the cash flow that is used to meet the firm’s obligations to its debt holders and that is distributed to its stockholders, which in turn defines the value of their investments in the firm over time. The cash flow to investors is calculated as the cash flow to investors from operating activity, minus the cash flow invested in net working capital, minus the cash flow invested in long-term assets.

8 Discuss the difference between average and marginal tax rates.

The average tax rate is computed by dividing the total taxes paid by taxable income. It takes into account the taxes paid at all levels of income. The marginal tax rate is the rate that is paid on the next dollar of income earned. When companies are making financial investment decisions, they use the marginal tax rate because new projects are expected to generate additional cash flows, which will be taxed at the firm’s marginal tax rate. Under a flat tax system, the marginal and average rates are the same. Under a progressive tax system, the average tax rate will normally be lower than the marginal rate.

3.2 The Ellicott City Ice Cream Company management has just completed an assessment of the company’s assets and liabilities and has obtained the following information. The firm has total current assets worth $625,000 at book value and $519,000 at market value. In addition, its long-term assets include plant and equipment valued at market for $695,000, while their book value is $940,000. The company’s total current liabilities are valued at market for $543,000, while their book value is $495,000. Both the book value and the market value of long-term debt are $350,000. If the company’s total assets are equal to a market value of $1,214,000 (book value of $1,565,000), what are the book value and market value of its stockholders’ equity?



3.3 Depreciation and amortization expenses are:

Part of current assets on the balance sheet.
After-tax expenses that reduce a firm’s cash flows.
Long-term liabilities that reduce a firm’s net worth.
Noncash expenses that cause a firm’s after-tax cash flows to exceed its net income.

6 Looking at Exhibit 3.2, we find that the total expenses (in millions) are as follows: $1,081.1 + $231.1 + $83.1 + $5.6 + $44.3 = $1,445.2.
7 From the 2020 balance sheet ($ millions): (1) Current assets − Cash = $1,039.8 − $288.5 = $751.3, and (2) Current liabilities − Notes payable = $377.8 − $10.5 = $367.3. The calculations are similar for the 2019 balance sheet.
8 From the 2020 balance sheet, note the following ($ millions): Debt = $574.0 (long-term debt) + $10.5 (notes payable) = $584.5 and equity = $50.0 (common stock) + $842.9 (additional paid-in capital) − $23.3 (treasury stock) = $869.6. The calculations for 2019 are made in a similar manner.

The last three decades witnessed a major shift in the U.S. retailing marketplace. By taking advantage of logistic and purchasing advantages, large-scale discount chains have been able to reduce their costs and lower prices for consumers, fueling the explosive expansion of retailers such as the Target and Walmart Stores. Competition for customers between these two firms is intense, with Target pursuing a strategy reliant on consumer discretionary purchases, and Walmart focused on very low prices for consumer basics.

Just how do analysts compare the performance of companies like Target and Walmart? One approach is to compare accounting data from the financial statements that companies file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Below are data for total sales and net income for Target and Walmart for their fiscal years ending early 2020.

Target ($ millions)	Walmart ($ millions)
Total sales	$77,130	$523,964
Net income	$  3,281	$  14,881
The accounting numbers by themselves are not very revealing. Walmart is a much larger firm than Target, with greater sales and net income. This difference in size makes it difficult to assess the actual performance differences between the two firms. However, if we compute the net profit margin, one of the profitability ratios discussed in this chapter, we can identify more clearly the performance difference between the two retailers. The net profit margins (net income/total sales) for Target and Walmart are 4.25 percent and 2.84 percent, respectively. This means that for every $100 in revenues, Target is able to generate $4.25 in profit, whereas Walmart generates only $2.84. As this example illustrates, one advantage of using ratios is that they make direct comparisons of companies possible by adjusting for size differences.

This chapter discusses financial ratio analysis (or financial statement analysis), which involves the calculation and comparison of ratios derived from financial statements. These ratios can be used to draw useful conclusions about a company’s financial condition, its operating efficiency, and the attractiveness of its securities as investments.

Chapter Preview
In Chapter 3 we reviewed the basic structure of financial statements. This chapter explains how financial statements are used to evaluate a company’s overall performance and assess its strengths and shortcomings. The basic tool used to do this is financial ratio analysis. Financial ratios are computed by dividing one number from a firm’s financial statements by another such number in order to allow for meaningful comparisons between firms or areas within a firm.

Management can use the information from this type of analysis to help maximize the firm’s value by identifying areas where performance improvements are needed. For example, the analysis of data from financial statements can help determine why a firm’s cash flows are increasing or decreasing, why a firm’s profitability is changing, and whether a firm will be able to pay its bills next month.

We begin the chapter by discussing some general guidelines for financial statement analysis, along with four different perspectives on financial analysis: those of the stockholder, manager, creditor, and other stakeholders. Next, we describe how to prepare common-size financial statements, which allow us to compare firms that differ in size and to analyze a firm’s financial performance over time. We then explain how to calculate and interpret key financial ratios and discuss the DuPont system, a diagnostic tool that uses financial ratios. After a discussion of benchmarks, we conclude with a description of the limitations of financial statement analysis.

4.1 Background for Financial Statement Analysis
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the four perspectives from which financial statements can be viewed.
This chapter will guide you through a typical financial statement analysis, which involves the use of financial statements to analyze a company’s performance and assess its strengths and weaknesses. First, we look at the different perspectives we can take when analyzing financial statements; then we present some helpful guidelines for financial statement analysis.

financial statement analysis the use of financial statements to analyze a company’s performance and assess its strengths and weaknesses

Perspectives on Financial Statement Analysis
Stockholders and stakeholders may differ in the information they want to gain when analyzing financial statements. In this section, we discuss four perspectives from which we can view financial statement analysis: those of (1) stockholders, (2) managers, (3) creditors, and (4) other stakeholders.

Stockholders’ Perspective

Stockholders are primarily concerned with the value of their stock and with how much cash they can expect to receive from dividends and capital appreciation over time. Therefore, stockholders want financial statements to tell them how profitable the firm is, what the return on their investment is, and how much cash is available for stockholders, both in total and on a per-share basis. Ultimately, stockholders are interested in how much a share of stock is worth. We address pricing issues in detail in Chapter 9, but financial analysis is a key step in valuing a company’s stock.

Managers’ Perspective

Broadly speaking, management’s perspective of financial statement analysis is similar to that of stockholders. The reason is that stockholders own the firm and managers have a fiduciary responsibility to make decisions that are in the owners’ best interests. Thus, managers are interested in the same performance measures as stockholders: profitability, how much cash is available for stockholders, capital appreciation, return on investment, and the like.

Managers, however, are also responsible for running the business on a daily basis and must make decisions that will maximize the value of the stockholders’ shares in the long run. Maximizing the value of the stockholders’ shares does not involve a single big decision, but rather a series of smaller day-to-day decisions. Thus, managers need feedback on the short-term impact these day-to-day decisions have on the firm’s financial statements and its current stock price. For example, managers can track trends in sales and can determine how well they are controlling expenses and how much of each sales dollar goes to the bottom line. In addition, managers can see the impact of their capital budgeting, financing, and working capital decisions reflected in the financial statements. Keep in mind that managers, as insiders, have access to much more detailed financial information than those outside the firm. Generally, outsiders only have access to published financial statements for publicly traded firms.

Creditors’ Perspective

The primary concern of creditors is whether and when they will receive the interest payments they are entitled to and when they will be repaid the money they loaned to the firm. Thus, a firm’s creditors, including long-term bondholders, closely monitor how much debt the firm is currently using, whether the firm is generating enough cash to pay its day-to-day bills, and whether the firm will have sufficient cash in the future to make interest and principal payments on long-term debt after satisfying obligations that have a higher legal priority, such as paying employees’ wages. Of course, the firm’s ability to pay interest and principal ultimately depends on cash flows and profitability; hence, creditors—like stockholders and managers—are interested in those aspects of the firm’s financial performance.

Other Stakeholders’ Perspective

In Chapter 1 we noted that other stakeholders, including suppliers and employees, have claims on the firm’s cash flows. The specific interest of stakeholders in the firm’s financial statements will depend on who those stakeholders are. However, like stockholders, managers, and creditors, stakeholders are generally interested in the firm’s cash flows, profitability, and overall financial performance. For example, suppliers are interested in learning the firm’s ability to pay for current and future purchases. Employees might want to know if the firm is likely to lay people off. Stakeholders and the broader community are also increasingly interested in the ability of firms to make environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments, which include sustainability and corporate social responsibility initiatives.

Guidelines for Financial Statement Analysis
We turn now to some general guidelines that will help you when analyzing a firm’s financial statements. First, make sure you understand which perspective you are adopting to conduct your analysis: stockholder, manager, creditor, or other stakeholder. The perspective will dictate the type of information you need for the analysis and may affect the actions you take based on the results.

Second, always use audited financial statements if they are available. As we discussed in Chapter 1, an audit means that an independent accountant has attested that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the firm’s financial condition at a point in time. If the statements are unaudited, your analysis will require extra effort. For example, if you are a creditor considering making a loan, you will need to undertake an especially diligent examination of the company’s books before closing the deal. It would also be a good idea to make sure you know the company’s management team and accountant very well. This will provide additional insight into the creditworthiness of the firm.

Third, use financial statements that cover three to five years, or more, to conduct your analysis. This enables you to perform a trend analysis, which involves looking at historical financial statements to see how various ratios are increasing, decreasing, or staying constant over time.

trend analysis analysis of trends in financial data over time

Fourth, when possible, it is always best to compare a firm’s financial statements with those of competitors that are roughly the same size and that offer similar products and services. If you compare firms of disparate size, the results may be meaningless because the two firms may have very different infrastructures, sources of financing, production capabilities, product mixes, and distribution channels. For example, comparing The Boeing Company’s financial statements with those of Piper Aircraft, a firm that manufactures small aircraft, makes no sense whatsoever, although both firms manufacture aircraft. You will have to use your judgment as to whether relevant comparisons can be made between firms with large size differences.

In business it is common to benchmark a firm’s performance, as discussed in the previous paragraph. The most common type of benchmarking involves comparing a firm’s performance with the performance of similar firms that are relevant competitors. For example, Ford Motor Company management may want to benchmark the firm’s performance against General Motors and Toyota, a broader group of Ford’s competitors in the world market, or the industry as a whole. Firms can also be benchmarked against themselves. For example, they can compare this year’s performance with last year’s performance or with a specific goal, such as a 10 percent growth in sales. We discuss benchmarking in more detail later in this chapter.

4.2 Common-Size Financial Statements
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe common-size financial statements, explain why they are used, and be able to prepare and use them to analyze the historical performance of a firm.
A common-size financial statement is one in which each number is expressed as a percentage of some base number, such as total assets or net revenues (net sales). For example, each number on a balance sheet may be divided by total assets. Dividing numbers by a common base to form a ratio is called scaling. Scaling is an important concept, and you will read more about it later in this chapter in the discussion of financial ratios. Financial statements scaled in this manner are also called standardized financial statements.

common-size financial statement a financial statement in which each number is expressed as a percentage of a base number, such as total assets or net revenues (net sales)

Common-size financial statements make it easier to evaluate changes in a firm’s performance and financial condition over time. They also allow you to make more meaningful comparisons between the financial statements of two firms that are different in size. For example, in the oil and gas field equipment market, Schlumberger Limited is the major competitor of Diaz Manufacturing, the illustrative firm introduced in Chapter 3. However, Schlumberger has over $55 billion in total assets, while Diaz Manufacturing’s assets total only $1.9 billion. Without common-size financial statements, comparisons of these two firms would be difficult to interpret. Common-size financial statements are also useful for analyzing trends within a single firm over time, as you will see.

Common-Size Balance Sheets
To create a common-size balance sheet, we divide each of the asset accounts by total assets. We also divide each of the liability and equity accounts by total assets since Total assets = Total liabilities + Total equity. You can see the common-size balance sheet for Diaz Manufacturing in Exhibit 4.1. Assets are shown in the top portion of the exhibit, and liabilities and stockholders’ equity in the lower portion. The calculations are simple. For example, on the asset side in 2020, cash and marketable securities were 15.3 percent of total assets ($288.5/$1,889.2 = 0.153, or 15.3 percent), and inventory was 22.4 percent of total assets ($423.8/$1,889.2 = 0.224, or 22.4 percent). Notice that the percentages of total assets add up to 100 percent. On the liability side, accounts payable and accruals are 18.5 percent of total assets ($349.3/$1,889.2 = 0.185, or 18.5 percent), and long-term debt is 30.4 percent ($574.0/$1,889.2 = 0.304, or 30.4 percent). To test yourself, see if you can re-create the percentages in Exhibit 4.1 using your calculator. Make sure the percentages add up to 100, but realize that you may obtain slight variations from 100 because of rounding.

What kind of information can Exhibit 4.1 tell us about Diaz Manufacturing’s operations? Here are some examples. Notice that in 2020, inventories accounted for 22.4 percent of total assets, down from 24.9 percent in 2019 and 28.6 percent in 2018. In other words, Diaz Manufacturing has been steadily reducing the proportion of its money tied up in inventory. This is probably good news because it is usually a sign of more efficient inventory management.

Now look at liabilities and equity, and notice that in 2020 total liabilities represent 50.4 percent of Diaz Manufacturing’s total liabilities and equity. This means that common stockholders have provided 49.6 percent of the firm’s total financing and that creditors have provided 50.4 percent of the financing. In addition, you can see that from 2018 to 2020. Diaz Manufacturing substantially increased the proportion of financing from long-term debt holders. Long-term debt provided 21.1 percent ($295.6/$1.398.0 = 0.211, or 21.1 percent) of the financing in 2018 and 30.4 percent ($574.0/$1,889.2 = 0.304, or 30.4 percent) in 2020.

Overall, we can identify the following trends in Diaz Manufacturing’s common-size balance sheet. First, Diaz Manufacturing is a growing company. Its assets increased from $1,398.0 million in 2018 to $1,889.2 million in 2020. Second, the percentage of total assets held in current assets grew from 2018 to 2020, a sign of increasing liquidity. Recall from Chapter 2 that assets are liquid if they can be sold easily and quickly for cash without a loss of value. Third, the percentage of total assets in plant and equipment declined from 2018 to 2020, a sign that Diaz Manufacturing is becoming more efficient because it is using fewer long-term assets in producing sales (below you will see that net sales have increased over the same period). Finally, as mentioned, Diaz Manufacturing has significantly increased the percentage of its financing from long-term debt. Generally, these are considered signs of a solidly performing company, but we have a long way to go before we can confidently reach that conclusion. We will now turn to Diaz Manufacturing’s common-size income statement.

Common-Size Income Statements
The most useful way to prepare a common-size income statement is to express each account as a percentage of net sales, as shown for Diaz Manufacturing in Exhibit 4.2. Net sales are defined as total sales less all sales discounts and sales returns and allowances. You should note that when looking at accounting information and sales numbers as reported, they almost always mean net sales, unless otherwise stated. We will follow this convention in the book. Again, the percent calculations are simple. For example, in 2020 selling and administrative expenses are 14.8 percent of sales ($231.1/$1,563.7 = 0.148, or 14.8 percent), and net income is 7.6 percent of sales ($118.5/$1,563.7 = 0.076, or 7.6 percent). Before proceeding, make sure that you can verify each percentage in Exhibit 4.2 with your calculator.

Interpreting the common-size income statement is also straightforward. As you move down the income statement, you will find out exactly what happens to each dollar of sales that the firm generates. For example, in 2020 it cost Diaz Manufacturing 69.1 cents in cost of goods sold to generate one dollar of sales. Similarly, it cost 14.8 cents in selling and administrative expenses to generate a dollar of sales. The government took 2.8 percent of sales in the form of taxes.

EXHIBIT 4.2 Common-Size Income Statements for Diaz Manufacturing for Fiscal Years Ending December 31 ($ millions)

Common-size income statements express each account as a percentage of net sales. These statements allow financial analysts to better compare firms of different sizes and to analyze trends in a single firm’s income statement accounts over time.

 	2020	2019	2018
 	 	% of Net Sales	 	% of Net Sales	 	% of Net Sales
Net sales	$1,563.7	100.0	$1,386.7	100.0	$1,475.1	100.0
Cost of goods sold	  1,081.1	  69.1	     974.8	   70.3	 1,076.3	   73.0
Selling and administrative expenses	     231.1	  14.8	     197.4	   14.2	    205.7	   13.9
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)	$ 251.5	  16.1	$ 214.5	  15.5	$ 193.1	  13.1
Depreciation	     83.1	    5.3	      75.3	   5.4	     71.2	   4.8
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)	$ 168.4	  10.8	$ 139.2	10.0	$ 121.9	   8.3
Interest expense	        5.6	     0.4	      18.0	   1.3	     27.8	   1.9
Earnings before taxes (EBT)	$ 162.8	  10.4	$ 121.2	   8.7	$   94.1	   6.4
Taxes	     44.3	    2.8	      16.1	   1.2	     27.9	   1.9
Net income	$ 118.5	    7.6	$ 105.1	   7.6	$  66.2	   4.5
Dividends	—		—		—	
Addition to retained earnings	$  118.5		$ 105.1		$  66.2	
The common-size income statement can tell us a lot about a firm’s efficiency and profitability. For example, in 2018, Diaz Manufacturing’s cost of goods sold and selling and administrative expenses totaled 86.9 percent of sales (73.0 percent + 13.9 percent = 86.9 percent). By 2020, these expenses had declined to 83.9 percent of sales (69.1 percent + 14.8 percent = 83.9 percent). This might mean that Diaz Manufacturing is negotiating lower prices from its suppliers or is more efficient in its use of materials and labor. It could also mean that the company is getting higher prices for its products, perhaps by offering fewer discounts or rebates. The important point, however, is that more of each dollar of sales is contributing to net income.

The trends in the income statement and balance sheet suggest that Diaz Manufacturing is improving along a number of dimensions. The real question, however, is whether Diaz Manufacturing is performing as well as other firms in the same industry. For example, the fact that 7.6 cents of every dollar of sales reaches the bottom line may not be a good sign if we find out that Diaz Manufacturing’s competitors average 10 cents of net income for every dollar of sales.

4.3 Financial Ratios and Firm Performance
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss how financial ratios facilitate financial analysis and be able to compute and use them to analyze a firm’s performance.
In addition to the common-size ratios we have just discussed, other specialized financial ratios help analysts interpret the myriad of numbers in financial statements. In this section we examine financial ratios that measure a firm’s liquidity, efficiency, leverage, profitability, and market value, using Diaz Manufacturing as an example. Keep in mind that for ratio analysis to be most useful, it should also include trend and benchmark analyses, which we discuss in more detail later in this chapter.

Why Ratios Are Better Measures
A financial ratio is simply one number from a financial statement that has been divided by another financial number. Like the percentages in common-size financial statements, ratios eliminate problems arising from differences in size because the denominator of the ratio adjusts, or scales, the numerator to a common base.

financial ratio a number from a financial statement that has been scaled by dividing by another financial number

Here’s an example. Suppose you want to assess the profitability of two firms. Firm A’s net income is $5, and firm B’s is $50. Which firm had the best performance? You really cannot tell because you have no idea what asset base was used to generate the income. In this case, a relevant measure of financial performance for a stockholder might be net income scaled by the firm’s stockholders’ equity—that is, the return on equity (ROE):

If firm A’s total stockholders’ equity is $25 and firm B’s stockholders’ equity is $5,000, the ROE for each firm is as follows:

Firm	ROE Calculation	        ROE        
A	$5/$25	0.20, or 20%
B	$50/$5,000	0.01, or 1%
As you can see, the ROE for firm A is 20 percent—much larger than the ROE for firm B at 1 percent. Even though firm B had the higher net income in absolute terms ($50 versus $5), its stockholders had invested more money in the firm ($5,000 versus $25), and it generated less income per dollar of invested equity than firm A. Clearly, firm A’s performance is better than firm B’s, given its smaller equity investment. The bottom line is that accounting numbers are more easily compared and interpreted when they are scaled.

Choice of Scale Is Important

An important decision is your choice of the “size factor” for scaling. The size factor you select must be relevant and make economic sense. For example, suppose you want a measure that will enable you to compare the productivity of employees at a particular plant with the productivity of employees at other plants that make similar products. Your assistant makes a suggestion: divide net income by the number of parking spaces available at the plant. Will this ratio tell you how productive labor is at a plant? Clearly, the answer is no.

Your assistant comes up with another idea: divide net income by the number of employees. This ratio makes sense as a measure of employee productivity. A higher ratio indicates that employees are more productive because, on average, each employee is generating more income. In business, the type of variable most commonly used for scaling is a measure of size, such as total assets or total net sales. Other scaling variables are used in specific industries where they are especially informative. For example, in the airline industry, a key measure of performance is revenue per available seat mile; in the steel industry, it is sales or cost per ton; and in the automobile industry, it is cost per car produced.

Other Comments on Ratios

The ratios we present in this chapter are widely accepted and are almost always included in any financial workup. However, you will find that different analysts will compute many of these standard ratios slightly differently. Modest variation in how ratios are computed is not a problem as long as the analyst carefully documents the work done and discloses the ratio formula. These differences are particularly important when you are comparing data from different sources.

Short-Term Liquidity Ratios
Liquid assets have active secondary markets and can be sold quickly for cash without a loss of value. Some assets are more liquid than others. For example, short-term marketable securities are very liquid because they can be easily sold in the secondary market at or near the original purchase price. In contrast, plant and equipment can take months or years to sell and often must be sold substantially below the cost of building or acquiring them.

When we examine a company’s liquidity position, we want to know whether the firm can pay its bills when cash flow from operations is insufficient to pay short-term obligations, such as payroll, invoices from vendors, and maturing bank loans. As the name implies, short-term liquidity ratios focus on whether the firm has the ability to convert current assets into cash quickly without loss of value. As we have noted before, even a profitable business can fail if it cannot pay its current bills on time. The inability to pay debts when they are due is known as insolvency. Thus, liquidity ratios are also known as short-term solvency ratios. The two most important liquidity ratios are the current ratio and the quick ratio.

insolvency the inability to pay debts when they are due

The Current Ratio

To calculate the current ratio, we divide current assets by current liabilities.1 The formula is presented below, along with a calculation of the current ratio for Diaz Manufacturing for 2020 based on balance sheet account data from Exhibit 4.1:

(4.1)
Diaz Manufacturing’s current ratio is 2.75, which should be read as “2.75 times.” What does this number mean? If Diaz Manufacturing were to take its current supply of cash and add to it the proceeds of liquidating its other current assets—such as marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventory—it would have $1,039.8 million. This $1,039.8 million would cover the firm’s short-term obligations of $377.8 million approximately 2.75 times, leaving a cushion of $662.0 million ($1,039.8 million − $377.8 million = $662.0 million).

Now turn to Exhibit 4.3, which shows the ratios discussed in this chapter for Diaz Manufacturing for the three-year period 2018 to 2020. The exhibit will allow us to identify important trends in the company’s financial statements. Note that Diaz Manufacturing’s current ratio has been steadily increasing over time. What does this trend mean? From the perspective of a potential creditor, it is a positive sign. To a potential creditor, more liquidity is better because it means that the firm has a greater ability, at least in the short term, to make payments. From a stockholder’s perspective, however, too much liquidity is not necessarily a good thing. If we were to discover that Diaz Manufacturing has a much higher current ratio than its competitors, it could mean that management is being too conservative by keeping too much money tied up in current assets, leaving less cash flow for investors. Generally, more liquidity is better and is a sign of a healthy firm. Only a benchmark analysis can tell us the complete story, however.

Note: Numbers may not add up because of rounding.
The Quick Ratio

The quick ratio is similar to the current ratio except that inventory is subtracted from current assets in the numerator. The quick ratio accounts for the fact that inventory is often much less liquid than other current assets. Inventory is the most difficult current asset to convert to cash without loss of value. Of course, the liquidity of inventory varies with the industry. For example, inventory of a raw material commodity, such as gold or crude oil, is more likely to be sold with little loss in value than inventory consisting of perishables, such as fruit, or fashion items, such as this season’s designer jacket. Another reason for excluding inventory in the quick ratio calculation is that the book value of inventory may be significantly more than its market value because it may be obsolete, partially completed, spoiled, out of fashion, or out of season.

To calculate the quick ratio—or acid-test ratio, as it is sometimes called—we divide current assets, less inventory, by current liabilities. The calculation for Diaz Manufacturing for 2020 is as follows, based on balance sheet data from Exhibit 4.1:

(4.2)
The quick ratio of 1.63 times means that if we exclude inventory, Diaz Manufacturing had $1.63 of current assets for each dollar of current liabilities. You can see from Exhibit 4.3 that Diaz Manufacturing’s liquidity position, as measured by its quick ratio, has been increasing over time.

Note that the quick ratio is usually less than the current ratio, as it was for Diaz Manufacturing in 2020.2 The quick ratio is a very conservative measure of liquidity because the calculation assumes that the inventory is valued at zero, which in most cases is not a realistic assumption. Even in a bankruptcy “fire sale,” the inventory can be sold for some small percentage of its book value, generating at least some cash.

Decision Making Example 4.1 illustrates how short-term liquidity ratios vary across different types of businesses.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 4.1
The Liquidity Paradox

Situation

You are asked by your boss whether Walmart or Intuit is more liquid. You have the following information:

Walmart	Intuit
Current ratio	0.79	2.26
Quick ratio	0.19	2.26
You also know that Walmart carries a large inventory and that Intuit is a service firm that specializes in accounting and income-tax preparation services and software. Which firm is more liquid? Your boss asks you to explain the reasons for your answer and also to explain why Intuit’s current and quick ratios are the same.



Efficiency Ratios
We now turn to a group of ratios called efficiency ratios or asset turnover ratios, which measure how efficiently a firm uses it assets. These ratios are quite useful for managers and financial analysts in identifying the inefficient use of current and long-term assets. They are also valuable for a firm’s investors who use the ratios to find out how quickly a firm is selling its inventory and converting receivables into cash flow for investors.

Inventory Turnover and Days’ Sales in Inventory

We measure inventory turnover by dividing the cost of goods sold from the income statement by inventory from the balance sheet (see Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2). The cost of goods sold is used because it reflects the book value of the inventory that is sold by a firm. The formula for inventory turnover and its value for Diaz Manufacturing in 2020 are:

(4.3)
The firm “turned over” its inventory 2.55 times during the year. Looking back at Exhibit 4.3, you can see that this ratio remained about the same over the period covered.

What exactly does “turning over” inventory mean? Consider a simple example. Assume that a firm starts the year with inventory worth $100 and replaces the inventory when it is all sold — that is, when the inventory goes to zero. If, over the course of the year, the firm sells the inventory and replaces it three times, the firm is said to have an inventory turnover of three times.

As a general rule, turning over inventory faster is a good thing because it means that the firm is doing a good job of minimizing its investment in inventory. Nevertheless, like all ratios, inventory turnover can be either too high or too low. Too high an inventory turnover ratio may signal that the firm has too little inventory for its customers and could be losing sales as a result. If the firm’s inventory turnover level is too low, it could mean that management is not managing the firm’s inventory efficiently or that an unusually large portion of the inventory is obsolete or out of date. In sum, inventory turnover that is significantly lower or significantly higher than that of competitors calls for further investigation.

Based on the inventory turnover figure, and using a 365-day year, we can also calculate the days’ sales in inventory, which tells us how long it takes a firm to turn over its inventory on average. The formula for days’ sales in inventory, along with the 2020 calculation for Diaz Manufacturing, is as follows:

(4.4)
Note that inventory turnover in the formula is computed using Equation 4.3. On average, Diaz Manufacturing takes about 143 days to turn over its inventory. Generally speaking, the smaller the number, the more efficient the firm is at moving its inventory.

Alternative Calculation for Inventory Turnover

Normally, we determine inventory turnover by dividing cost of goods sold by the inventory level at the end of the period. However, if a firm’s inventory fluctuates widely or is growing (or decreasing) over time, some analysts prefer to compute inventory turnover using the average inventory value for the time period. In this case, the inventory turnover is calculated in two steps:

We first calculate average inventory by adding beginning and ending inventory and dividing by 2:
We then divide the cost of goods sold by average inventory to find inventory turnover:
Note that all six efficiency ratios presented in the chapter (Equations 4.3 through 4.8) can be computed using an average asset value. For simplicity, we will generally use the end-of-period asset value in our calculations.

Learning by Doing Application 4.1 illustrates the alternative calculation for efficiency ratios using financial data for Diaz Manufacturing.

Accounts Receivable Turnover and Days’ Sales Outstanding

Many firms make sales to their customers on credit, which creates an account receivable on the balance sheet. It does not do the firm much good to ship products or provide the services on credit if it cannot ultimately collect the cash from its customers. A firm that collects its receivables faster is generating cash faster. We can measure the speed at which a firm converts its receivables into cash with a ratio called accounts receivable turnover; the formula and calculated values for Diaz Manufacturing in 2020 are as follows:

(4.5)
The data to compute this ratio is from Diaz’s balance sheet and income statement (Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2). Roughly, this ratio means that Diaz Manufacturing loans out and collects an amount equal to its outstanding accounts receivable 5.11 times over the course of a year.

In most circumstances, higher accounts receivable turnover is a good thing—it means that the firm is making fewer sales on credit and collecting cash payments from its credit customers faster. Such credit is a customer incentive that is used to promote sales, but it can be expensive. As shown in Exhibit 4.3, Diaz’s collection speed slowed down slightly from 2018 to 2020. This may be a cause for management concern for at least three reasons. First, Diaz’s system for collecting accounts receivable may be inefficient. Second, the firm’s customers may not be paying on time because their businesses are slowing down due to industry or general economic conditions. Finally, Diaz may be extending credit to customers that are poor credit risks. Making a determination of the cause would require us to compare Diaz’s accounts receivable turnover with corresponding figures from its competitors.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 4.1
Alternative Calculations for Efficiency Ratios

Problem

For Diaz Manufacturing, compute inventory turnover during 2020 using the average inventory. Then compare that value with 2.55, the turnover ratio computed using Equation 4.3. Why do the two values differ?





You may find it easier to evaluate a firm’s credit and collection policies by using days’ sales outstanding, often referred to as DSO, which is calculated as follows:

(4.6)
Note that accounts receivable turnover is computed using Equation 4.5. The DSO for Diaz Manufacturing means that, on average, the company converts its credit sales into cash in 71.43 days. DSO is commonly called the average collection period.

Generally, faster collection is better. Whether 71.43 days is fast enough really depends on industry norms and on the credit terms Diaz Manufacturing extends to its customers. For example, if the industry average DSO is 77 days and Diaz Manufacturing gives customers up to 90 days to pay, then a DSO of 71.43 days is an indication of good management. If, in contrast, Diaz gives customers 60 days to pay, the company has a problem, and management needs to determine why customers are not paying on time.

Asset Turnover Ratios

We turn next to a discussion of some broader efficiency ratios. In this section we discuss two ratios that measure how efficiently management is using the firm’s assets to generate sales.

Total asset turnover measures the dollar amount of sales generated with each dollar of total assets. Generally, the higher the total asset turnover, the more efficiently management is using total assets. Thus, if a firm increases its asset turnover, management is squeezing more sales out of a constant asset base. When a firm’s asset turnover ratio is high for its industry, the firm may be approaching full capacity. In such a situation, if management wants to increase sales, it will need to make an investment in additional fixed assets. Total asset turnover should be interpreted with care when examining trends for a given firm or when benchmarking against competitors. Younger firms and firms with more recent purchases of fixed assets will have a higher book value of assets and therefore lower total asset turnover for a given level of net sales.

The formula for total asset turnover and the calculation for Diaz Manufacturing’s turnover value in 2020 (based on data from Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2) are as follows:

(4.7)
Total asset turnover for Diaz Manufacturing is 0.83 times. In other words, in 2020, Diaz Manufacturing generated $0.83 in sales for every dollar in assets. In Exhibit 4.3 you can see that Diaz Manufacturing’s total asset turnover has declined since 2018. This does not necessarily mean that the company’s management team is performing poorly. The decline could be part of a typical industry sales cycle, or it could be due to a slowdown in the business of Diaz Manufacturing’s customers. As always, getting a better fix on potential problems requires comparing Diaz Manufacturing’s total asset turnover with comparable figures for its close competitors.

The turnover of total assets is a “big picture” measure. In addition, management may want to see how particular types of assets are being put to use. A common asset turnover ratio measures sales per dollar invested in fixed assets (plant and equipment). The fixed asset turnover formula and the 2020 calculation for Diaz are:

(4.8)
Diaz Manufacturing generated $3.92 of sales for each dollar of net fixed assets in 2020, which is an increase over the 2019 value of $3.52. This means that the firm is generating more sales for every dollar in fixed assets. In a manufacturing firm that relies heavily on plant and equipment to generate output, the fixed asset turnover number is an important ratio. In contrast, in a service-industry firm with little plant and equipment, total asset turnover is more relevant.

Decision Making Example 4.2 illustrates how fixed asset turnover ratios vary across firms from different industries.

Leverage Ratios
Leverage ratios measure the extent to which a firm uses debt rather than equity financing and indicate the firm’s ability to meet its long-term financial obligations, such as interest payments on debt and lease payments. The ratios are also called long-term solvency ratios. They are of interest to the firm’s creditors, stockholders, managers, and other stakeholders. Many different leverage ratios are used in industry; in this chapter we present some of the most widely used.

Financial Leverage

The term financial leverage refers to the use of debt in a firm’s capital structure. When a firm uses debt financing, rather than only equity financing, the returns to stockholders may be magnified. This so-called leveraging effect occurs because the interest payments associated with much long-term debt and some short-term debt are fixed, regardless of the level of the firm’s operating profits. On the one hand, if the firm’s operating profits increase from one year to the next, fixed debt holders continue to receive only their fixed-interest payments, and all of the increase goes to the stockholders. On the other hand, if the firm falls on hard times and suffers an operating loss, these debt holders receive the same fixed-interest payment (assuming that the firm does not become insolvent and default on its obligations to debt holders), and the loss is charged against the stockholders’ equity. Thus, debt increases the returns to stockholders during good times and reduces the returns during bad times. In Chapter 16 we discuss financial leverage in greater depth and present a detailed example of how debt financing creates the leveraging effect.

financial leverage the use of debt in a firm’s capital structure; the more debt, the higher the financial leverage

The use of debt in a company’s capital structure increases the firm’s default (insolvency) risk—the risk that it will not be able to pay its debt as it comes due. The explanation is, of course, that debt payments are a fixed obligation and debt holders must be paid the interest and principal payments they are owed, regardless of whether the company earns a profit or suffers a loss. If a company fails to make an interest payment on the prescribed date, the company defaults on its debt and could be forced into bankruptcy by creditors.

default (insolvency) risk the risk that a firm will not be able to pay its debt obligations as they come due

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 4.2
Ranking Firms by Fixed Asset Turnover

Situation

Different industries use different amounts of fixed assets to generate their revenues. For example, the airline industry is capital intensive, with large investments in airplanes, whereas firms in software and service industries use more human capital (people) and have very little invested in fixed assets. As a financial analyst, you are given the following fixed asset turnover ratios: 0.71, 4.36, and 8.83. You must decide which ratios match up with three firms: Delta Air Lines, Intuit, and Walmart. Make this decision, and explain your reasoning.



Debt Ratios

We next look at three leverage ratios that focus on how much debt, rather than equity, the firm uses in its capital structure. The more debt a firm uses, the higher its financial leverage, the more volatile its earnings, and the greater its risk of default.

Total Debt Ratio
The total debt ratio measures the extent to which the firm finances its assets from sources other than the stockholders. The higher the total debt ratio, the more debt the firm has in its capital structure. The total debt ratio and a calculation for Diaz Manufacturing for 2020 based on data from Exhibit 4.1 appear as follows:

(4.9)
How do we determine the figure to use for total debt? Many variations are used, but perhaps the easiest is to subtract total equity from total assets. In other words, total debt is equal to total liabilities. A common alternative measure of debt is the sum of all the firm’s interest-bearing liabilities, such as notes payable and long-term debt. Using data from Exhibit 4.1, we can calculate total debt for Diaz Manufacturing in 2020 as follows:

As you can see from Equation 4.9, the total debt ratio for Diaz Manufacturing is 0.50, which means that 50 percent of the company’s assets are financed with debt. Looking back at Exhibit 4.3, we find that Diaz Manufacturing increased its use of debt from 2019 to 2020. The 2020 total debt ratio of 50 percent appears high, raising questions about the company’s financing strategy. Whether a high or low value for the total debt ratio is good or bad, however, depends on how the firm’s capital structure affects the value of the firm. We explore this topic in greater detail in Chapter 16.

We turn next to two common variations of the total debt ratio: the debt-to-equity ratio and the equity multiplier.

Debt-to-Equity Ratio
The total debt ratio tells us the amount of debt for each dollar of total assets. The debt-to-equity ratio tells us the amount of debt for each dollar of equity. Based on data from Exhibit 4.1, Diaz Manufacturing’s debt-to-equity ratio for 2020 is 1.02:

(4.10)
The total debt ratio and the debt-to-equity ratio are directly related by the following formula, shown with a calculation for Diaz Manufacturing:

As you can see, once you know one of these ratios, you can compute the other. Which of the two ratios you use is really a matter of personal preference.

Learning by Doing Application 4.2 and Learning by Doing Application 4.3 illustrate additional debt ratio calculations.

Solving for an Unknown Using the Debt-to-Equity Ratio

Problem

You are given the following information about Intuit’s year-end balance sheet for 2020. The firm’s debt-to-equity ratio is 1.14, and its total equity is $5.11 billion. Determine the book (accounting) values for Intuit’s total debt and total assets.





Equity Multiplier
The equity multiplier tells us the amount of assets that the firm has for every dollar of equity. Diaz Manufacturing’s equity multiplier ratio in 2020 was 2.02, as shown here:

(4.11)
Notice that the equity multiplier is directly related to the debt-to-equity ratio:

This is no accident. Recall the balance sheet identity: Total assets = Total liabilities (debt) + Total stockholders’ equity. This identity can be substituted into the numerator of the equity multiplier formula (Equation 4.11):

Therefore, all three of these leverage ratios (Equations 4.9–4.11) are related by the balance sheet identity, and once you know one of the three ratios, you can compute the other two ratios.

Coverage Ratios

A second type of leverage ratio measures the firm’s ability to service its debt, or how easily the firm can “cover” its debt payments out of earnings or cash flow. We assess this using coverage ratios. For example, if your monthly take-home pay from your part-time job is $400 and the rent on your apartment is $450, your monthly coverage ratio with respect to rent is $400/$450 = 0.89 times. Because this ratio is less than 1, you will be in some financial distress. Your income does not cover your $450 fixed obligation to pay the rent. If, on the other hand, your take-home pay is $900, your monthly coverage ratio with respect to rent is $900/$450 = 2 times. This means that for every dollar of rent you must pay, you earn two dollars of revenue. The higher your coverage ratio, the less likely you are to default on your rent payments.

Times Interest Earned
Our first coverage ratio is times interest earned, which measures the extent to which operating profits (earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT) cover the firm’s interest expenses. Creditors prefer to lend to firms whose EBIT is far in excess of their interest payments. The equation for the times-interest-earned ratio and a calculation for Diaz Manufacturing from its income statement (Exhibit 4.2) for 2020 are:

(4.12)
Diaz Manufacturing can cover its interest charges about 30 times with its operating income. This figure appears to point to a good margin of safety for creditors. In general, the larger the times interest earned, the more likely the firm is to make its interest payments.

Cash Coverage
As we have discussed before, depreciation is a noncash expense, and as a result, no cash goes out the door when depreciation is deducted on the income statement. Thus, rather than asking whether operating profits (EBIT) are sufficient to cover interest payments, we might ask how much cash is available to cover interest payments. The cash a firm has available from operations to meet interest payments is better measured by EBIT plus depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).3 Thus, the cash coverage ratio for Diaz Manufacturing in 2020 is:

(4.13)
For firms with depreciation or amortization expenses, which include virtually all firms, EBITDA coverage will be larger than times interest earned coverage.

Profitability Ratios
Profitability ratios measure management’s ability to efficiently use the firm’s assets to generate sales and manage the firm’s operations. These measurements are of interest to stockholders, creditors, managers, and other stakeholders because they focus on the firm’s earnings. The profitability ratios presented in this chapter are among a handful of such ratios commonly used by stockholders, managers, and creditors when analyzing a firm’s performance. In general, the higher the profitability ratios, the better the firm is performing.

Gross Profit Margin

The gross profit margin measures the percentage of net sales remaining after the cost of goods sold is paid. It captures the firm’s ability to manage the expenses directly associated with producing the firm’s products or services. Using data from Exhibit 4.2, the gross profit margin formula, along with a calculation for Diaz Manufacturing in 2020, is:

(4.14)
Thus, after paying the cost of goods sold, Diaz Manufacturing has 30.86 percent of the sales amount remaining to pay other expenses. From Exhibit 4.3, you can see that Diaz Manufacturing’s gross profit margin has been increasing over the past several years, which is good news.

Operating Profit Margin and EBITDA Margin

Moving farther down the income statement, you can measure the percentage of sales that remains after payment of cost of goods sold and all other expenses, except for interest and taxes. Operating profit is typically measured as EBIT. The operating profit margin, therefore, gives an indication of the profitability of the firm’s operations, independent of its financing policies or tax management strategies. The operating profit margin formula, along with Diaz Manufacturing’s 2020 operating profit margin, calculated using data from Exhibit 4.2, is as follows:

(4.15)
Many analysts and investors are concerned with cash flows generated by operations rather than operating earnings and will use EBITDA in the numerator instead of EBIT. Calculated in this way, the operating profit margin is referred to as the EBITDA margin.

Net Profit Margin

The net profit margin is the percentage of sales remaining after all of the firm’s expenses, including interest and taxes, have been paid. The net profit margin formula is shown here, along with the calculated value for Diaz Manufacturing in 2020, using data from the firm’s income statement (Exhibit 4.2):

(4.16)
As you can see from Exhibit 4.3, Diaz Manufacturing’s net profit margin improved dramatically from 4.49 percent in 2018 to 7.58 percent in 2020. This is good news. The question remains, however, whether 7.58 percent is a good profit margin. Answering this question requires that we compare Diaz Manufacturing’s performance to the performance of its competitors, which we will do later in this chapter. What qualifies as a good profit margin varies significantly across industries. Generally speaking, the higher a company’s profit margin, the better the company’s performance.

Return on Assets

So far, we have examined profitability as a percentage of sales. It is also important that we analyze profitability as a percentage of investment, either in assets or in equity. First, let’s look at return on assets. In practice, return on assets is calculated in two different ways.

One approach provides a measure of operating profit (EBIT) per dollar of assets. This is a powerful measure of return because it tells us how efficiently management utilized the assets under their command, independent of financing decisions and taxes. It can be thought of as a measure of the pre-tax return on the total net investment in the firm from operations. The formula for this version of return on assets, which we call EBIT return on assets (EROA), is shown next, together with the calculated value for Diaz Manufacturing in 2020, using data from Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2:

(4.17)
Exhibit 4.3 shows us that, unlike the other profitability ratios, Diaz Manufacturing’s EROA did not really improve from 2018 to 2020. The very similar EROA values for 2018 and 2020 indicate that assets increased at approximately the same rate as operating profits.

Some analysts calculate return on assets (ROA) as:

(4.18)
Although it is a common calculation, we advise against using the calculation in Equation 4.18 unless you are using the DuPont system, which we discuss shortly. The ROA calculation divides a measure of earnings available to stockholders (net income) by total assets (debt plus equity), which is a measure of the investment in the firm by both stockholders and creditors. Constructing a ratio of those two numbers is like mixing apples and oranges. The information that this ratio provides about the efficiency of asset utilization is obscured by the financing decisions the firm has made and the taxes it pays. You can see this in Exhibit 4.3, which shows that, in contrast to the very small change in EROA, ROA increases substantially from 2018 to 2020. This increase in ROA is not due to improved efficiency, but rather to a large decrease in interest expense (see Exhibit 4.2).

The key point is that EROA surpasses ROA as a measure of how efficiently assets are utilized in operations. Dividing a measure of earnings to both debt holders and stockholders by a measure of how much both debt holders and stockholders have invested gives us a clearer view of what we are trying to measure.

In general, when you calculate a financial ratio, if you have a measure of income to stockholders in the numerator, you want to make sure that you have only investments by stockholders in the denominator. Similarly, if you have a measure of total profits from operations in the numerator, you want to divide it by a measure of total investments by both debt holders and stockholders.

Return on Equity

Return on equity (ROE) measures net income as a percentage of the stockholders’ investment in the firm. The return on equity formula and the calculation for Diaz Manufacturing in 2020, based on data from Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, are as follows:

(4.19)
Alternative Calculation of ROA and ROE

As with efficiency ratios, the calculation of ROA and ROE involves dividing an income statement value, which relates to a period of time, by a balance sheet value from the end of the time period. Some analysts prefer to calculate ROA and ROE using the average asset value or equity value, where the average value is determined as follows:

Using the average asset or equity value makes sense because the earnings over a period are generated with the average value of assets or equity.

Market-Value Indicators
The ratios we have discussed so far rely solely on the firm’s financial statements, and we know that much of the data in those statements are historical and do not represent current market values. Also, as we discussed in Chapter 1, the appropriate objective for the firm’s management is to maximize stockholder value, and the market value of the stockholders’ claims is the value of the cash flows that they are entitled to receive, which is not necessarily the same as accounting income. To find out how the stock market evaluates a firm’s liquidity, efficiency, leverage, and profitability, we need ratios based on market values.

Over the years, financial analysts have developed a number of ratios, called market-value ratios, which combine market-value data with data from a firm’s financial statements. Here we examine the most commonly used market-value ratios: earnings per share, the price-earnings ratio, and the market-to-book ratio.

Earnings per Share

Dividing a firm’s net income by the number of shares outstanding yields earnings per share (EPS). At the end of 2020, Diaz Manufacturing had 54,566,054 shares outstanding (see Exhibit 3.1 in Chapter 3) and net income of $118.5 million (Exhibit 4.2). Its EPS at that point is calculated as follows:

(4.20)
Price-Earnings Ratio

The price-earnings (P/E) ratio relates earnings per share to price per share. The formula, with a calculation for Diaz Manufacturing for the end of 2020, is as follows:

(4.21)
Price per share on a given date can be obtained from listings in the Wall Street Journal or from an online source, such as Yahoo! Finance.

What does it mean for a firm to have a price-earnings ratio of 22.4? It means that the stock market places a value of $22.40 on every $1 of net income. Why are investors willing to pay $22.40 for a claim on $1 of earnings? The answer is that the stock price does not reflect only the earnings this year. It reflects all future cash flows from earnings. An especially high P/E ratio can indicate that investors expect the firm’s earnings to grow rapidly in the future. Alternatively, a high P/E ratio might be due to unusually low earnings in a particular year, and investors might expect earnings to recover to a normal level soon. We will discuss how expected growth affects P/E ratios in detail in later chapters. As with other measures, to understand whether the P/E ratio is too high or too low, we must compare the firm’s P/E ratio with those of competitors and also look at movements in the firm’s P/E ratio relative to market trends.

Market-to-Book Ratio

The market-to-book ratio compares the market value of the firm’s investments to its book value. The formula, with a calculation for Diaz at the end of 2020, is:

(4.22)
Book value per share is an accounting number that reflects the cumulative historical investment into the firm’s equity account on a per share basis. Market value of equity per share is simply the price per share. A higher market-to-book ratio suggests that the firm has been more effective at investing in projects that add value for its stockholders. A value of less than one could mean that the firm has not created any value for its stockholders.

Concluding Comments on Ratios
We could have covered many more ratios. However, the group of ratios presented in this chapter is a fair representation of the ratios needed to analyze the performance of a business. When using ratios, it is important that you ask yourself, “What does this ratio mean, and what is it measuring?” rather than trying to memorize a definition. Good ratios should make good economic sense when you look at them.

4.4 The Dupont System: A Diagnostic Tool
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the DuPont system of analysis and be able to use it to evaluate a firm’s performance and identify corrective actions that may be necessary.
By now, your mind may be swimming with ratios. Fortunately, some enterprising financial managers at the DuPont Company developed a system that ties together some of the most important financial ratios and provides a systematic approach to financial ratio analysis.

An Overview of the DuPont System
The DuPont system of analysis is a diagnostic tool that uses financial ratios to evaluate a company’s financial health. The process has three steps. First, management assesses the company’s financial health using the DuPont ratios. Second, if any problems are identified, management corrects them. Finally, management monitors the firm’s financial performance over time, looking for differences from ratios established as benchmarks by management.

Under the DuPont system, management is charged with making decisions that maximize the firm’s return on equity as opposed to maximizing the value of the stockholders’ shares. The system is primarily designed to be used by management as a diagnostic and corrective tool, though investors and other stakeholders have found its diagnostic powers of interest.

The DuPont system is derived from two equations that link the firm’s return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The system identifies three areas where management should focus its efforts in order to maximize the firm’s ROE: (1) how much profit management can earn on sales, (2) how efficient management is in using the firm’s assets, and (3) how much financial leverage management is using. Each of these areas is monitored by a single ratio, and together the ratios comprise the DuPont equation.

The ROA Equation
The ROA equation links the firm’s return on assets with its total asset turnover and net profit margin. We derive this relation from the ROA equation as follows:

As you can see, we start with the ROA formula presented earlier as Equation 4.18. Then we multiply ROA by net sales divided by net sales. In the third line, we rearrange the terms, coming up with the expression ROA = (Net income/Net sales) × (Net sales/Total assets). You may recognize the first ratio in the third line as the firm’s net profit margin (Equation 4.16) and the second ratio as the firm’s total asset turnover (Equation 4.7). Thus, we end up with the final equation for ROA, which is restated as Equation 4.23:

(4.23)
Equation 4.23 says that a firm’s ROA is determined by two factors: (1) the firm’s net profit margin and (2) the firm’s total asset turnover. Let’s look at the managerial implications of each of these terms.

Net Profit Margin
The net profit margin ratio can be written as follows:

As you can see, the net profit margin can be viewed as the product of three ratios: (1) the operating profit margin (EBIT/Net sales), which is Equation 4.15, (2) a ratio that measures the impact of interest expenses on profits (EBT/EBIT), and (3) a ratio that measures the impact of taxes on profits (Net income/EBT). Thus, the net profit margin focuses on management’s ability to generate profits from sales by efficiently managing the firm’s (1) operating expenses, (2) interest expenses, and (3) tax expenses.

Total Asset Turnover
Total asset turnover, which is defined as Net sales/Total assets, measures how efficiently management uses the assets under its command—that is, how much output management can generate with a given asset base.

Net Profit Margin versus Total Asset Turnover

The ROA equation provides some very interesting managerial insights. It says that if management wants to increase the firm’s ROA, it can increase the net profit margin, total asset turnover, or both. Of course, every firm would like to make both terms as large as possible so as to earn the highest possible ROA. Though every industry is different, competition, marketing considerations, technology, and manufacturing capabilities, to name a few, place upper limits on asset turnover and net profit margins and, thus, ROA. Equation 4.23 suggests that management can follow two distinct strategies to maximize ROA. Deciding between the strategies involves a trade-off between total asset turnover and net profit margin.

The first management strategy emphasizes high profit margin and low asset turnover. Examples of companies that use this strategy are luxury stores, such as jewelry stores, high-end department stores, and specialty apparel stores. Such stores carry relatively expensive merchandise that has a high profit margin but tends to sell slowly. The second management strategy depends on low profit margins and high turnover. Examples of firms that use this strategy are discount stores and grocery stores, which have very low profit margins but make up for it by turning over their inventory very quickly. A typical chain grocery store, for example, turns over its inventory more than 12 times per year.

Exhibit 4.4 illustrates both strategies. The exhibit shows asset turnover, profit margin, and ROA for four retailing firms for the fiscal year ending closest to January 2020. Deckers Outdoor Corporation sells specialty footwear, including Teva and UGG. LVMH is a European seller of upscale products ranging from Krug champagne to Christian Dior clothing. At the other end of the spectrum are Target Corporation, the “Expect more, pay less” chain, and Walmart, which is famous for its low-price, high-volume strategy.

EXHIBIT 4.4 Two Basic Strategies to Earn a Higher ROAa

To maximize a firm’s ROA, management can focus more on achieving high profit margins or on achieving high asset turnover. High-end retailers like Deckers Outdoor Corporation and LVMH focus more on achieving high profit margins. In contrast, grocery and discount stores like Target and Walmart tend to focus more on achieving high asset turnover because competition limits their ability to achieve very high profit margins.

Company	Asset Turnover	×	Profit Margin (%)	=	ROA (%)
High Profit Margin:					
  Deckers Outdoor Corporation	1.21		12.95		15.67
  LVMH	0.56		14.50		  8.12
High Turnover:					
  Target	1.80		  4.25		  7.65
  Walmart Stores	2.22		  2.84		  6.30
aRatios are calculated using financial results for the fiscal year ending closest to January 2020.
Notice that the two specialty or luxury-item retailers (Deckers Outdoor Corporation and LVMH) have lower asset turnover and higher profit margins, while the grocery and discount stores have lower profit margins and much higher asset turnover. LVMH’s ROA is lower than Deckers Outdoor Corporation’s due to its low asset turnover. Target and Walmart are strong financial performers in their industry sectors. Their relatively low ROAs of 7.65 and 6.30 percent, respectively, reflect the high degree of competition in the grocery and discount store businesses.

The ROE Equation
To derive the ROE equation, we start with the formula from Equation 4.19:

Next, we multiply by total assets divided by total assets, and then we rearrange the terms so that ROE = (Net income/Total assets) × (Total assets/Total equity), as shown in the third line. By this definition, ROE is the product of two ratios already familiar to us: ROA (Equation 4.18) and the equity multiplier (Equation 4.11). The equation for ROE is shown as Equation 4.24:

(4.24)
Interesting here is the fact that ROE is determined by the firm’s ROA and its use of leverage. The greater the use of debt in the firm’s capital structure, the greater the ROE. Thus, increasing the use of leverage is one way management can increase the firm’s ROE—but at a price. That is, the greater the use of financial leverage, the more risky the firm. How aggressively a company uses this strategy depends on management’s preference for risk and the willingness of creditors to lend money and bear the risk.

The DuPont Equation
Now we can combine our two equations into a single equation. From Equation 4.24, we know that ROE = ROA × Equity multiplier; and from Equation 4.23, we know that ROA = Net profit margin × Total asset turnover. Substituting Equation 4.23 into Equation 4.24 yields an expression formally called the DuPont equation, as follows:

(4.25)
We can also express the DuPont equation in ratio form:

(4.26)
To check the DuPont relation, we will use some values from Exhibit 4.3, which lists financial ratios for Diaz Manufacturing. For 2020, Diaz’s net profit margin is 7.58 percent, total asset turnover is 0.83, and the equity multiplier is 2.02. Substituting these values into Equation 4.25 yields:

With rounding error, this agrees with the value computed for ROE using Equation 4.19.

Applying the DuPont System
In summary, the DuPont equation tells us that a firm’s ROE is determined by three factors: (1) net profit margin, which measures the firm’s operating efficiency and how it manages its interest expense and taxes; (2) total asset turnover, which measures the efficiency with which the firm’s assets are utilized; and (3) the equity multiplier, which measures the firm’s use of financial leverage. The schematic diagram in Exhibit 4.5 shows how the three key DuPont ratios are linked together and how they relate to the balance sheet and income statement for Diaz Manufacturing.

The DuPont system of analysis is a useful tool to help identify problem areas within a firm. For example, suppose that North Sails Group, a sailboat manufacturer located in San Diego, California, is having financial difficulty. Management hires you to find out why the ship is financially sinking. You calculate the DuPont ratio values for the firm and obtain some industry averages to use as benchmarks, as shown.

DuPont Ratios	Firm	Industry
ROE	      8%	      16%
ROA	      4%	      8%
Equity multiplier	  2	  2
Net profit margin	      8%	      16%
Asset turnover	0.5	0.5
EXHIBIT 4.5 Relations in the DuPont System of Analysis for Diaz Manufacturing in 2020 ($ millions) The diagram shows how the three key DuPont ratios are linked together and to the firm’s balance sheet and income statement. Numbers in the exhibit are in millions of dollars and represent 2020 data from Diaz Manufacturing. The ROE of 12.67 percent differs from the 12.64 percent in Exhibit 4.3 due to rounding.


Clearly, the firm’s ROE is quite low compared to its industry (8 percent versus 16 percent), so without question the firm has problems. Next, you examine the values for the firm’s ROA and equity multiplier. The firm’s use of financial leverage is equal to the industry standard of 2 times, but its ROA is half that of the industry (4 percent versus 8 percent). Because ROA is the product of net profit margin and total asset turnover, you next examine these two ratios. Asset turnover does not appear to be a problem because the firm’s ratio is equal to the industry standard of 0.5 times. However, the firm’s net profit margin is substantially below the benchmark standard (8 percent versus 16 percent). Thus, the firm’s performance problem stems from a low profit margin.

Identifying the low profit margin as an area of concern is only a first step. Further investigation is necessary to determine the underlying problem and its causes. The point to remember is that financial analysis identifies areas of concern within the firm, but rarely does it tell us all we need to know.

Is Maximizing ROE an Appropriate Goal?
Throughout this book we have stressed the notion that management should make decisions that maximize the current value of the company stock. An important question is whether maximizing the value of ROE, as suggested by the DuPont system, is equivalent to maximizing share price. The short answer is that the two goals are not equivalent, but some discussion is warranted.

A major shortcoming of ROE is that it does not directly consider cash flow. ROE considers earnings, but earnings are not the same as future cash flows. A second concern is that, ROE does not consider risk. As discussed in Chapter 1, management and stockholders are very concerned about the degree of risk they face. Finally, ROE does not consider the size of the initial investment or the size of future cash payments. As we stressed in Chapter 1, the essence of any business or investment decision is this: What is the size of the cash flows to be received, when do you expect to receive the cash flows, and how likely are you to receive them?

Despite these shortcomings, ROE analysis is widely used in business as a measure of operating performance. Proponents of ROE analysis argue that it provides a systematic way for management to work through the income statement and balance sheet and to identify problem areas within the firm. Furthermore, they note that ROE and stockholder value are often highly correlated.

4.5 Selecting a Benchmark
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what benchmarks are, describe how they are prepared, and discuss why they are important in financial statement analysis.
How do you judge whether a ratio value is too high or too low? Is the value good or bad? We touched on these questions several times earlier in this chapter. As we suggested, the starting point for making these judgments is selecting an appropriate benchmark—a standard that will be the basis for meaningful comparisons. Financial managers can gather appropriate benchmark data in three ways: through trend, industry, and peer group analysis.

Trend Analysis
Trend analysis uses history as its standard by evaluating a single firm’s performance over time. This sort of analysis allows management to determine whether a given ratio value has increased or decreased over time and whether there has been an abrupt shift in a ratio value. An increase or decrease in a ratio value is in itself neither good nor bad. However, a ratio value that is changing typically prompts the financial manager to sort out the issues surrounding the change and to take any action that is warranted. Exhibit 4.3 shows the trends in Diaz Manufacturing’s ratios. For example, the increase in Diaz’s current ratio indicates that the company’s liquidity has improved.

Industry Analysis
A second way to establish a benchmark is to conduct an industry group analysis. To do that, we identify a group of firms that have the same product line, compete in the same market, and are about the same size. The average ratio values for these firms will be our benchmarks. Since no two firms are identical, deciding which firms to include in the analysis is always a judgment call. If we can construct a sample of reasonable size, however, the average values provide defensible benchmarks.

Financial ratios and other financial data for industry groups are published by a number of sources—the U.S. Department of Commerce, Dun & Bradstreet, the Risk Management Association, and Standard & Poor’s (S&P), to name a few. One widely used system for identifying industry groups is the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) System. The SIC codes are four-digit numbers established by the federal government for statistical reporting purposes. The first two digits describe the type of business in a broad sense (for example, firms engaged in building construction, mining of metals, manufacturing of machinery, food stores, or banking). Diaz’s two-digit code is 35: “Industrial and commercial machinery and computer equipment manufacturing.”

More than 350 U.S. public companies fall into the “Industrial and commercial machinery and computer equipment manufacturing” code category. To narrow the group, we use more digits. Diaz Manufacturing’s four-digit code is 3533 (“oil and gas field machinery and equipment manufacturing”), and there are only 31 firms in this category. Among firms within an SIC code, financial ratio data can be further categorized by asset size or by sales, which allows for more meaningful comparisons.

In 1977, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) was introduced as a new classification system. It was intended to refine and replace the older SIC codes, but it has been slow to catch on. Industry databases still allow you to sort data by either SIC or NAICS classifications.

Although industry databases are readily available and easy to use, they are far from perfect. When trying to find a sample of firms that are similar to your company, you may find the classifications too broad. For example, Walmart and Nordstrom have the same four-digit SIC code (5311), but they are very different retailing firms. Another problem is that different databases may compute ratios differently. Thus, when making benchmark comparisons, you must be careful that your calculations match those in the database, or there could be some distortions in your findings.

Peer Group Analysis
The third way to establish benchmark information is to identify a group of firms that compete with the company we are analyzing. Ideally, the firms are in similar lines of business, are about the same size, and are direct competitors of the target firm. These firms form a peer group. Once a peer group has been identified, management can obtain the associated financial information and compute average ratio values against which the firm can compare its performance.

How do we determine which firms should be in the peer group? The senior management team within a company will know its competitors. If you’re working outside the firm, you can look at the firm’s annual report and at financial analysts’ reports. Both of these sources usually identify key competitors. Exhibit 4.6 shows ratios for a five-firm peer group constructed for Diaz Manufacturing for 2018 through 2020.

EXHIBIT 4.6 Peer Group Ratios for Diaz Manufacturing

Peer group analysis is one way to establish benchmarks for a firm. Ideally, a firm’s peer group is made up of firms that are direct competitors and are about the same size. The exhibit shows the average financial ratios for public companies that make up the peer group for Diaz Manufacturing for 2018, 2019, and 2020.

We consider the peer group methodology the best way to establish a benchmark if financial data for peer firms are publicly available. We should note, however, that comparison against a single firm is acceptable when there is a clear market leader and we want to compare a firm’s performance and other characteristics against those of a firm considered the best. For example, Ford Motor Company may want to compare itself directly against the automobile manufacturer that is the most productive. It is worthwhile to compare a firm with the market leader to identify areas of relative strength and weakness.

4.6 Using Financial Ratios
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Identify the major limitations in using financial statement analysis.
So far, our focus has been on the calculation of financial ratios. As you may already have concluded, however, the most important tasks are to correctly interpret the ratio values and to make appropriate decisions based on this interpretation. In this section we discuss using financial ratios in performance analysis.

Performance Analysis of Diaz Manufacturing
Let’s examine Diaz Manufacturing’s performance during 2020, using the DuPont system of analysis as our diagnostic tool and the peer group sample in Exhibit 4.6 as our benchmark. For ease of discussion, Diaz’s financial ratios and the peer group data are assembled in Exhibit 4.7.

We start our analysis by looking at the big picture—the three key DuPont ratios for the firm and a peer group of firms (see Exhibit 4.7). We see that Diaz Manufacturing’s ROE of 12.64 percent is below the benchmark value of 13.07 percent, a difference of 0.43 percent, which is not good news. More dramatically, Diaz’s ROA is 3.07 percent below the peer group benchmark, which is a serious difference. Clearly, Diaz Manufacturing has some performance problems that need to be investigated.

To determine the problems, we examine the firm’s equity multiplier and ROA results in more detail. The equity multiplier value of 2.02, versus the benchmark value of 1.40, suggests that Diaz Manufacturing is using more leverage than the average firm in the benchmark sample. Management is comfortable with the higher-than-average leverage. Conversations with the firm’s investment banker, however, indicate that the company’s debt could become a problem if the economy deteriorated and went into a recession.

EXHIBIT 4.7 Peer Group Analysis for Diaz Manufacturing in 2020

Examining the differences between the ratios of a firm and its peer group is a good way to spot areas that require further analysis.

 	(1)	(2)	(3)
 	Diaz Ratio	Peer Group Ratio	Difference (Column 1 – Column 2)
DuPont Ratios:			
  Return on equity (%)	12.64	13.07	(0.43)
  Return on assets (%)	  6.27	  9.34	(3.07)
  Equity multiplier (%)	  2.02	  1.40	0.62
  Net profit margin (%)	  7.58	10.74	(3.16)
  Total asset turnover	  0.83	  0.87	(0.04)
  Asset Ratios:			
  Current ratio	  2.75	  2.10	0.65
  Fixed asset turnover	  3.92	  3.50	0.42
  Inventory turnover	  2.55	  5.40	(2.85)
  Accounts receivable turnover	  5.11	  4.90	0.21
  Profit Margins:			
  Gross profit margin (%)	30.86	26.80	4.06
  Operating margin (%)	10.77	12.00	(1.23)
  Net profit margin (%)	  7.58	10.74	(3.16)
Without the higher equity multiplier and management’s willingness to bear additional risk, Diaz Manufacturing’s ROE would be much lower. To illustrate this point, suppose management reduced the company’s leverage to the peer group average equity multiplier of 1.40 (see Exhibit 4.7). With an equity multiplier of 1.40, the firm’s ROE would be only 8.78 percent (0.0627 × 1.40 = 0.0878, or 8.78 percent); this is 3.86 percent below the firm’s current ROE of 12.64 percent and 4.29 percent below the peer group benchmark. Thus, the use of higher leverage has, to some extent, masked the severity of the firm’s problem with ROA.

Recall that ROA equals the product of the net profit margin and total asset turnover. Diaz’s net profit margin is 3.16 percentage points lower than the benchmark value (7.58 percent − 10.74 percent = −3.16 percent), and its total asset turnover ratio is slightly below the benchmark value (0.83 versus 0.87). Thus, both ratios that comprise ROA are below the peer group benchmark standard, but the net profit margin appears to be the larger problem.

Turning to the asset turnover ratios shown in Exhibit 4.7, we find that the ratios for Diaz are generally similar to the corresponding peer group ratios. An exception is the inventory turnover ratio, which is substantially below the benchmark: 2.55 for Diaz versus 5.40 for the benchmark. Diaz’s management needs to investigate why the inventory turnover ratio is off the mark.

Because Diaz Manufacturing’s net profit margin is low, we next look at the various profit margins shown in Exhibit 4.7 to gain insight into this situation. Diaz Manufacturing’s gross profit margin is 4.06 percentage points above the benchmark value (30.86 percent − 26.80 percent = 4.06 percent), which is good news. Since gross profit margin is a factor of sales and the cost of goods sold, we can conclude that there is no problem with the price the firm is charging for its products or with its cost of goods sold.

Diaz’s problems begin with its operating margin of 10.77 percent, which is 1.23 percentage points below the peer group benchmark of 12.00 percent (10.77 percent − 12.00 percent = −1.23 percent). The major controllable expense here is selling and administrative costs, and management needs to investigate why these expenses appear to be out of line.

In sum, the DuPont analysis of Diaz Manufacturing has identified two areas that warrant detailed investigation by management: (1) the larger-than-average inventory (slow inventory turnover) and (2) the above-average selling and administrative expenses. Management must now investigate each of these areas and come up with a course of action. Management may also want to give careful consideration to the firm’s high degree of financial leverage and whether it represents a prudent degree of risk.

Financial ratio analysis is an excellent diagnostic tool. It helps management identify the problem areas in the firm—the symptoms. However, it does not tell management what the causes of the problems are or what course of action should be taken. Management must drill down into the accounting data, talk with managers in the field, and if appropriate, talk with people outside the firm, such as suppliers, to understand what is causing the problems and how best to fix them.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 4.5
Ron’s Jewelry Store and the Missing Data

Problem

Ron Roberts has owned and managed a profitable jewelry business in San Diego County for the past five years. He believes his jewelry store is one of the best managed in the county, and he is considering opening several new stores.

When Ron started the store, he supplied all the equity financing himself and financed the rest with personal loans from friends and family members. To open more stores, Ron needs a bank loan. The bank will want to examine his financial statements and know something about the competition he faces.

Ron has asked his brother-in-law, Dennis O’Neil, a CPA, to analyze the financials. Ron has also gathered some financial information about a company he considers the chief competition in the San Diego County market. The competitor has been in business for 25 years, has a number of stores, and is widely admired for its owners’ management skills. Dennis organizes the available information in the following table:

  Financial Ratio/Data	Ron’s Store	Competitor
  Net sales ($ thousands)	  $240	    $300
  Net income ($ thousands)	      $6	—
  ROE	    13.13%	—
  Net profit margin	—	       5.84%
  Asset turnover	1.5	1.5
  Equity multiplier	—	1.5
  Debt-to-equity ratio	2.5	—
Calculate the missing values for the financial data above.

  Financial Ratios	      Ron’s Store	            Competitor
  ROE	           13.13%	                13.14%
  ROA	             3.75%	                  8.76%

  Net sales ($ thousands)	$240	$300
  Net income ($ thousands)	    $6.0	      $17.5
Given the above financial ratios, what recommendations should Dennis make regarding Ron’s jewelry store and its management?

 

Limitations of Financial Statement Analysis
Financial statement and ratio analysis as discussed in this chapter presents two major problems. First, it depends on accounting data based on historical costs. As we discussed in Chapter 3, knowledgeable financial managers would prefer to use financial statements in which all of the firm’s assets and liabilities are valued at market. Financial statements based on current market values more closely reflect a firm’s true economic condition than do statements based on historical cost.

Second, there is little theory to guide us in making judgments based on financial statement and ratio analysis. That is why it is difficult to say a current ratio of 2.0 is good or bad or to say whether ROE or ROA is a more important ratio. The lack of theory explains, in part, why rules of thumb are often used as decision rules in financial statement analysis. The problem with decision rules based on experience rather than theory is that they may work fine in a stable economic environment, but may fail when a significant shift takes place. For example, if you developed a set of decision rules to help manage your business in an economic environment with low inflation, those decision rules might fail if the economy became inflationary.

Despite the limitations, we know that financial managers and analysts routinely use financial statements and ratio analysis to evaluate a firm’s performance and to make a variety of decisions about the firm. These financial statements and the resulting analysis are the primary means by which financial information is communicated both inside and outside of firms. The availability of market-value data is limited for public corporations, and such data are not available for privately held firms and other entities such as government units.

Thus, practically speaking, historical accounting information often represents the best available information. However, times are changing. As the accounting profession becomes more comfortable with the use of market-value data and as technology increases its availability and reliability and lowers its cost, we expect to see an increase in the use of market-based financial statements.

Before You Go On
Explain how the DuPont system allows us to evaluate a firm’s performance.
What are the limitations of traditional financial statement analysis?
List some of the problems that financial analysts confront when analyzing financial statements.
Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Explain the four perspectives from which financial statements can be viewed.

Financial statements can be viewed from the owners’, managers’, creditors’, or other stakeholders’ perspective. All four groups are ultimately interested in a firm’s profitability, but each group takes a different view. Stockholders want to know how much cash they can expect to receive, what their return on investment will be, and how much their stock is worth in the market. Managers are concerned with maximizing the firm’s long-term value through a series of day-to-day management decisions; thus, they need to see the impact of their decisions on the financial statements to confirm that things are going as planned. Creditors are concerned with how much debt the firm is using and whether the firm will have enough cash to meet its debt obligations. As to other stakeholders, suppliers are concerned about firm’s ability to pay for current and future purchases, while employees might want to know if the firm is able to pay wages or avoid layoffs.

2 Describe common-size financial statements, explain why they are used, and be able to prepare and use them to analyze the historical performance of a firm.

Common-size financial statements are financial statements in which each number has been scaled by a common measure of firm size: Balance sheets are expressed as a percentage of total assets, and income statements are expressed as a percentage of net sales. Common-size financial statements make it easier to evaluate changes in a firm’s performance and financial condition over time. They are also useful when comparing firms that are significantly different in size. The preparation of common-size financial statements and their use are illustrated for Diaz Manufacturing in Section 4.2.

3 Discuss how financial ratios facilitate financial analysis and be able to compute and use them to analyze a firm’s performance.

Financial ratios are used in financial analysis because they eliminate problems caused by comparing two or more companies of different size, or when looking at the same company over time as the size changes. Financial ratios can be divided into five categories: (1) Liquidity ratios measure the ability of a company to cover its current bills. (2) Efficiency ratios tell how efficiently the firm uses its assets. (3) Leverage ratios tell how much debt a firm has in its capital structure and whether the firm can meet its long-term financial obligations. (4) Profitability ratios focus on the firm’s earnings. (5) Market value indicators look at a company based on market data as opposed to historical data used in financial statements. The computation and analysis of major financial ratios are presented in Section 4.3 (also see the Summary of Key Equations that follows).

4 Describe the DuPont system of analysis and be able to use it to evaluate a firm’s performance and identify corrective actions that may be necessary.

The DuPont system of analysis is a diagnostic tool that uses financial ratios to assess a firm’s financial condition. Once the financial ratios are calculated and the assessment is complete, management can focus on correcting the problems within the context of maximizing the firm’s ROE. For analysis, the DuPont system breaks ROE into three components: net profit margin, which measures operating efficiency; total asset turnover, which measures how efficiently the firm’s assets are being used; and the equity multiplier, which measures financial leverage. A diagnostic analysis of a firm’s performance using the DuPont system is illustrated in Section 4.4.

5 Explain what benchmarks are, describe how they are prepared, and discuss why they are important in financial statement analysis.

Benchmarks are used to provide a standard for evaluating the financial performance of a firm. In financial statement analysis, a number of benchmarks are used. Most often, benchmark comparisons involve competitors that are roughly the same size and that offer a similar range of products. Another form of benchmarking is time-trend analysis, which compares a firm’s current financial ratios against the same ratios from past years. Time-trend analysis tells us whether a ratio has increased, decreased, or remained the same over time. The preparation and use of peer group benchmark data are illustrated in Section 4.6.

6 Identify the major limitations in using financial statement analysis.

The major limitations to financial statement and ratio analysis are the use of historical accounting data and the lack of theory to guide the decision maker. The lack of theory explains, in part, why there are so many rules of thumb. Rules of thumb are useful in that they may work under certain conditions. However, they may also lead to poor decisions if circumstances change.

Ethics Case
A Sad Tale: The Demise of Arthur Andersen
In January 2002, there were five major public accounting firms: Arthur Andersen, Deloitte Touche, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Ernst & Young. By late fall of that year, the number had been reduced to four. Arthur Andersen became the first major public accounting firm to be found guilty of a felony (a conviction later overturned), and as a result it virtually ceased to exist.


That such a fate could befall Andersen is especially sad given its early history. When Andersen and Company was established in 1918, it was led by Arthur Andersen, an acknowledged man of principle, and the company had a credo that became firmly embedded in the culture: “Think Straight and Talk Straight.” Andersen became an industry leader partly on the basis of high ethical principles and integrity.

How did a one-time industry leader find itself in a position where it received a corporate death penalty over ethical issues? First, the market changed. During the 1980s, a boom in mergers and acquisitions and the emergence of information technology fueled the growth of an extremely profitable consulting practice at Andersen. The profits from consulting contracts soon exceeded the profits from auditing, Andersen’s core business. Many of the consulting clients were also audit clients, and the firm found that the audit relationship was an ideal bridge for selling consulting services. Soon the audit fees became “loss leaders” to win audits, which allowed the consultants to sell more lucrative consulting contracts.

Tension between Audit and Consulting

At Andersen, tension between audit and consulting partners broke into open and sometimes public warfare. At the heart of the problem was how to divide the earnings from the consulting practice between the two groups. The resulting conflict ended in divorce, with the consultants leaving to form their own firm. The firm, Accenture, continues to thrive today.

Once the firm split in two, Andersen began to rebuild a consulting practice as part of the accounting practice. Consulting continued to be a highly profitable business, and audit partners were now asked to sell consulting services to other clients, a role that many auditors found uncomfortable.

Although the accountants were firmly in charge, the role of partners as salespersons compounded an already existing ethical issue—that of conflict of interest. It is legally well established that the fiduciary responsibility of a certified public accounting (CPA) firm is to the investors and creditors of the firm being audited. CPA firms are supposed to render an opinion as to whether a firm’s financial statements are reasonably accurate and whether the firm has applied generally accepted accounting principles in a consistent manner over time so as not to distort the financial statements. To meet their fiduciary responsibilities, auditors must maintain independence from the firms they audit.

What might interfere with the objective judgment of the public accounting firms? One problem arises because it is the audited companies themselves that pay the auditors’ fees. Auditors might not be completely objective when auditing a firm because they fear losing consulting business. This is an issue that regulators and auditors have not yet solved. But another problem arises in situations where accounting firms provide consulting services to the companies they audit. Although all of the major accounting firms were involved in this practice to some extent, Andersen had developed an aggressive culture for engaging partners to sell consulting services to audit clients.

Andersen’s Problems Mount

The unraveling of Andersen began in the 1990s with a series of accounting scandals at Sunbeam, Waste Management, and Colonial Realty—all firms that Andersen had audited. But scandals involving the energy giant Enron proved to be the firm’s undoing. The account was huge. In 2000 alone, Andersen received $52 million in fees from Enron, approximately 50 percent for auditing and 50 percent for other consulting services, especially tax services. The partner in charge of the account and his entire 100-person team worked out of Enron’s Houston office. Approximately 300 of Enron’s senior and middle managers had been Andersen employees.

Enron went bankrupt in December 2001 after large-scale accounting irregularities came to light, prompting an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It soon became clear that Enron’s financial statements for some time had been largely the products of accounting fraud, showing the company to be in far better financial condition than was actually the case. The inevitable question was asked: Why hadn’t the auditors called attention to Enron’s questionable accounting practices? The answer was a simple one. Andersen had major conflicts of interest. Indeed, when one member of Andersen’s Professional Standards Group objected to some of Enron’s accounting practices, Andersen removed him from auditing responsibilities at Enron—in response to a request from Enron management.

Playing Hardball and Losing

The SEC was determined to make an example of Andersen. The U.S. Justice Department began a criminal investigation, but investigators were willing to explore some “settlement options” in return for Andersen’s cooperation. However, Andersen’s senior management appeared arrogant and failed to grasp the political mood in Congress and in the country after a series of business scandals that had brought more than one large company to bankruptcy.

After several months of sparring with the Andersen senior management team, the Justice Department charged Andersen with a felony offense—obstruction of justice. Andersen was found guilty in 2002 of illegally instructing its employees to destroy documents relating to Enron, even as the government was conducting inquiries into Enron’s finances. During the trial, government lawyers argued that by instructing its staff to “undertake an unprecedented campaign of document destruction,” Andersen had obstructed the government’s investigation.

Since a firm convicted of a felony cannot audit a publicly held company, the conviction spelled the end for Andersen. But even before the guilty verdict, there had been a massive defection of Andersen clients to other accounting firms. The evidence presented at trial showed a breakdown in Andersen’s internal controls, a lack of leadership, and an environment in Andersen’s Houston office that fostered recklessness and unethical behavior by some partners.

In 2005, the United States Supreme Court unanimously overturned the Andersen conviction on the grounds that the jury was given overly broad instructions by the federal judge who presided over the case. But by then it was too late. Most of the Andersen partners had either retired or gone to work for former competitors, and the company had all but ceased to exist.

Discussion Questions
To what extent do market pressures encourage unethical behavior? Can the demise of Andersen be blamed on the fact that the market began rewarding consulting services of the kind Andersen could provide?
How serious are the kinds of conflicts of interest discussed in this case? Did Sarbanes-Oxley eliminate the most serious conflicts?
Was it fair for the government to destroy an entire company because of the misdeeds of some of its members, or had Andersen become such a serious offender that such an action on the part of the government was justified?

CHAPTER 5
The Time Value of Money
CHAPTER 5
The Time Value of Money

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Explain the concept of time value of money and why it is so important in the field of finance.
Explain the concept of future value, including the meaning of the terms principal, simple interest, and compound interest, and use the future value formula to make business decisions.
Explain the concept of present value and how it relates to future value, and use the present value formula to make business decisions.
Discuss why the concept of compounding is not restricted to money, and use the future value formula to calculate growth rates.
When you buy a new vehicle, whether its for a business or personal use, the decision of whether to pay cash or finance with debt can affect the price that you pay. For example, manufacturers often offer customers a choice between a cash rebate and low-cost financing. Both of these options will affect the ultimate cost of a vehicle for a buyer.

In October 2020, Honda Motor Company offered special financing terms for its 2020 Accord sedan. Honda offered buyers the choice between (1) receiving $500 off a base (suggested retail) price of $24,770 if they paid cash and (2) receiving 1.99 percent financing on a 60-month loan for the base price of the car. If you had enough cash to buy the car outright and did not need the cash for other purposes, the decision of whether to pay cash or finance the purchase depends on the rate of return you could earn if you financed the car and invested the cash. On the one hand, if it was only possible to earn a 1 percent interest rate, you would be better off paying cash and taking the discount. On the other hand, if it was possible to earn a 5 percent rate, you would be better off financing the purchase and investing the money.

As with most transactions, a crucial element in the analysis of the alternatives offered by Honda is the value of the expected cash flows. Because the cash flows to the two purchase alternatives take place in different time periods, they must be adjusted to account for the time value of money before they can be compared. You, as the buyer of the Accord, want to select the opportunity that results in the lowest value (price paid). This chapter and the next provide the knowledge and tools you need to make the correct decision. You will learn that whether you are dealing with a bank, in a boardroom, or at a car dealer, money has a time value—dollars today are worth more than dollars in the future—and you must account for this reality when making financial decisions.

Chapter Preview
Businesses routinely make decisions to invest in productive assets to earn income. Some assets, such as plant and equipment, are tangible, and other assets, such as patents and trademarks, are intangible. Regardless of the type of investment, a firm pays out money now in the hope that the value of the future cash inflows will exceed the cost of the asset. This process is what value creation is all about—buying productive assets that are worth more than they cost.

The valuation models presented in this book will require you to compute the present and future values of cash flows. This chapter and the next one provide the tools for making these calculations. Chapter 5 explains how to value a single cash flow in different time periods, and Chapter 6 covers valuation of multiple cash flows over time. These two chapters are critical for your understanding of corporate finance.

We begin this chapter with a discussion of the concept of time value of money. We then look at future value, which tells us how funds will grow if they are invested at a particular interest rate. Next, we discuss present value, which answers the question “What is the value today of cash payments that are to be received in the future?” We conclude the chapter with a discussion of several additional topics related to time value of money calculations.

5.1 The Time Value of Money
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the concept of time value of money and why it is so important in the field of finance.
In financial decision making, one basic problem managers face is determining the value of (or price to pay for) cash flows expected in the future. Why is this a problem? Consider as an example the popular Mega Millions lottery game.1 In Mega Millions, the jackpot continues to build up until some lucky person buys a winning ticket—the payouts for jackpot winning tickets often exceed $100 million.

If you won $100 million, headlines would read “Lucky Student Wins $100 Million Jackpot!” Does this mean that your ticket is worth $100 million on the day you win? The answer is no. A Mega Millions jackpot is paid either as a series of 30 payments over 29 years or as a cash lump sum. If you win “$100 million” and choose to receive the series of payments, the 30 payments will total $100 million. If you choose the lump sum option, Mega Millions will pay you less than the stated value of $100 million. This amount was about $80 million in January 2020. Thus, the value, or market price, of a “$100 million” winning Mega Millions ticket was really about $80 million because of the time value of money and the timing of the 30 cash payments. An appropriate question to ask now is “What is the time value of money?”

Consuming Today or Tomorrow
The time value of money is based on the idea that people prefer to consume goods today rather than wait to consume similar goods in the future. Most people would prefer to have a large-screen TV today than to have one a year from now, for example. Money has a time value because a dollar in hand today is worth more than a dollar to be received in the future. This makes sense because if you had the dollar today, you could buy something with it—or, instead, you could invest it and earn interest. For example, if you had $100,000 and you could buy a one-year bank certificate of deposit paying 5 percent interest, you could earn $5,000 interest for the year. At the end of the year, you would have $105,000 ($100,000 + $5,000 = $105,000). The $100,000 today is worth $105,000 a year from today. If the interest rate was higher, you would have even more money at the end of the year.

time value of money the difference in value between a dollar in hand today and a dollar promised in the future; a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future

Based on this example, we can make several generalizations. First, the value of a dollar invested at a positive interest rate grows over time. Thus, the further in the future you receive a dollar, the less it is worth today. Second, the trade-off between money today and money at some future date depends in part on the rate of interest you can earn by investing. The higher the rate of interest, the more likely you will elect to invest your funds and forgo current consumption. Why? At the higher interest rate, your investment will earn more money.

Building Intuition
The Value of Money Changes with Time

The term time value of money reflects the notion that people prefer to consume things today rather than at some time in the future. This makes a dollar in the future worth less than a dollar today. For this reason, people require compensation for deferring consumption.

In the next two sections, we look at two views of time value—future value and present value. First, however, we describe time lines, which are pictorial aids to help solve future and present value problems.

Time Lines as Aids to Problem Solving
Time lines are an important tool for analyzing problems that involve cash flows over time. They provide an easy way to visualize the cash flows associated with investment decisions. A time line is a horizontal line that starts at time zero and shows cash flows as they occur over time. The term time zero is used to refer to the beginning of a transaction in time value of money problems. Time zero is often the current point in time (today).

time zero the beginning of a transaction; often the current point in time

Exhibit 5.1 shows the time line for a five-year investment opportunity and its cash flows. Here, as in most finance problems, cash flows are assumed to occur at the end of the period. The project involves a $10,000 initial investment (cash outflow), such as the purchase of a new machine, that is expected to generate cash inflows over a five-year period: $5,000 at the end of Year 1, $4,000 at the end of Year 2, $3,000 at the end of Year 3, $2,000 at the end of Year 4, and $1,000 at the end of Year 5. Because of the time value of money, it is critical that you identify not only the size of the cash flows but also their timing.

If it is appropriate, the time line will also show the relevant interest rate for the problem. In Exhibit 5.1 this is shown as 5 percent. Also, note in Exhibit 5.1 that the initial cash flow of $10,000 is represented by a negative number. It is conventional that cash outflows from the firm, such as for the purchase of a new machine, are treated as negative values on a time line and that cash inflows to the firm, such as revenues earned, are treated as positive values. The −$10,000 therefore means that there is a cash outflow of $10,000 at time zero. As you will see, it makes no difference how you label cash inflows and outflows as long as you are consistent. That is, if all cash outflows are given a negative value, then all cash inflows must have a positive value. If the signs get mixed up—if some cash inflows are negative and some positive—you will get the wrong answer to any problem you are trying to solve.

Financial Calculator
We recommend that you purchase a financial calculator for this course. You can purchase an actual calculator, or one of many calculator emulator applications available for smart phones. A financial calculator will provide the computational tools to solve most problems in the book. A financial calculator is just an ordinary calculator that has preprogrammed future value and present value algorithms. To solve problems, all you have to do is press the proper keys. The instructions in this book are generally meant for Texas Instruments calculators, such as the TI BA II Plus. If you are using an HP, Sharp, or other calculator, consult the user’s manual for instructions.

EXHIBIT 5.1 Five-Year Time Line for a $10,000 Investment Time lines help us to correctly identify the size and timing of cash flows—critical tasks in solving time value problems. This time line shows the cash flows generated over five years by a $10,000 investment where the relevant interest rate is 5 percent.


It may sound as if the financial calculator will solve problems for you. It won’t. To get the correct answer you must first analyze the problem correctly and then identify the cash flows (size and timing), placing them correctly on a time line. Only then will you enter the correct inputs into the financial calculator.

A calculator can help you eliminate computation errors and save you a great deal of time. However, it is important that you understand the calculations that the calculator is performing. For this reason we recommend when you first start using a financial calculator that you solve problems without using the calculator’s financial functions and then use the financial functions to check your answers.

To help you master your financial calculator, throughout this chapter we provide hints on how to best use the calculator. We also recognize that some professors or students may want to solve problems using one of the popular spreadsheet applications. In this chapter and a number of other chapters, we provide solutions to several problems that lend themselves to spreadsheet analysis. In solving these problems, we used Microsoft Excel. We also provide spreadsheet solutions for additional problems on Wiley Course Resources. Since spreadsheets are commonly used in industry, you should make sure to learn how to use one of these programs early in your studies and become proficient with it before you graduate.

5.2 Future Value and Compounding
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the concept of future value, including the meaning of the terms principal, simple interest, and compound interest, and use the future value formula to make business decisions.
The future value (FV) of an investment is what the investment will be worth after earning interest for one or more time periods. The process of converting the initial amount into a future value is called compounding. We will define this term more precisely later. First, though, we illustrate the concepts of future value and compounding with an example.

future value (FV) the value of an investment after it earns interest for one or more periods

Single-Period Investment
Suppose you place $100 in a bank savings account that pays interest at 10 percent a year. How much money will you have in one year? Go ahead and make the calculation. Most people can intuitively arrive at the correct answer, $110, without the aid of a formula. Your calculation could have looked something like this:

This approach computes the amount of interest earned ($100 × 0.10) and then adds it to the initial, or principal, amount ($100). Notice that when we solve the equation, we factor out the $100. Recall from algebra that if you have the equation y = c + (c × x), you can factor out the common term c and get y = c × (1 + x). By doing this in our future value calculation, we arrived at the term (1 + 0.10). This term can be stated more generally as (1 + i), where i is the interest rate. As you will see, this is a pivotal term in all time value of money calculations.

Let’s use our intuitive calculation to generate a more general formula. First, we need to define the variables used to calculate the answer. In our example, $100 is the principal amount (P0), which is the amount of money deposited (invested) at the beginning of the transaction (time zero); the 10 percent is the simple interest rate (i); and the $110 is the future value (FV1) of the investment after one year. We can write the formula for a single-period investment as follows:

Looking at the formula, we more easily see mathematically what is happening in our intuitive calculation. P0 is the principal amount invested at time zero. If you invest for one period at an interest rate of i, your investment, or principal, will grow by (1 + i) per dollar invested. The term (1 + i) is the future value interest factor—often called simply the future value factor—for a single period, such as one year. To test the equation, we plug in our values:

Good, it works!

Two-Period Investment
We have determined that at the end of one year (one period), your $100 investment has grown to $110. Now let’s say you decide to leave this new principal amount (FV1) of $110 in the bank for another year earning 10 percent interest. How much money would you have at the end of the second year (FV2)? To arrive at the value for FV2, we multiply the new principal amount by the future value factor (1 + i). That is, FV2 = FV1 × (1 + i). Since FV1 = P0 × (1 + i), we can write this as:

The future value of your $110 at the end of the second year (FV2) is as follows:

Another way of thinking of a two-period investment is that it is two single-period investments back to back.

Turning to Exhibit 5.2, we can see what is happening to your $100 investment over the two years we have already discussed and beyond. The future value of $121 at Year 2 consists of three parts. First is the initial principal of $100 (first row of column 2). Second is the $20 ($10 + $10 = $20) of simple interest earned at 10 percent for the first and second years (first and second rows of column 3). Third is the $1 interest earned during the second year (second row of column 4) on the $10 of interest from the first year ($10 × 0.10 = $1.00). This is called interest on interest. The total amount of interest earned is $21 ($10 + $11 = $21), which is shown in column 5 (first and second rows) and is called compound interest.

EXHIBIT 5.2 Future Value of $100 at 10 Percent

With compounding, interest earned on an investment is reinvested so that, in future periods, interest is earned on interest as well as on the principal amount. Here, interest on interest begins accruing in Year 2.

 	 	Interest Earned	 
Year	Value at Beginning of Year	Simple Interest	 	Interest on Interest	 	Total (Compound) Interest	Value at End of Year
(1)	(2)	(3)	 	(4)	 	(5)	(6)
1	$100.00	$10.00	+	$0.00	=	$10.00	$110.00
2	110.00	10.00	+	1.00	=	11.00	121.00
3	121.00	10.00	+	2.10	=	12.10	133.10
4	133.10	10.00	+	3.31	=	13.31	146.41
5	146.41	10.00	+	4.64	=	14.64	161.05
Five‐year total	$100.00	$50.00	+	$11.05	=	$61.05	$161.05
We are now in a position to formally define some important terms already mentioned in our discussion. The principal is the amount of money on which interest is paid. In our example, the principal amount is $100. Simple interest is the amount of interest paid on the original principal amount. With simple interest, the interest earned each period is paid only on the original principal. In our example, the simple interest is $10 per year or $20 for the two years. Interest on interest is the interest earned on the reinvestment of previous interest payments. In our example, the interest on interest is $1 over the first two years. Compounding is the process by which interest earned on an investment is reinvested so that in future periods, interest is earned on the interest previously earned as well as the original principal. In other words, with compounding you are able to earn compound interest, which consists of both simple interest and interest on interest.

principal the amount of money on which interest is paid

simple interest interest earned on the original principal amount only

interest on interest interest earned on interest that was earned in previous periods

compounding the process by which interest earned on an investment is reinvested, so in future periods interest is earned on the interest as well as the original principal

compound interest interest earned both on the original principal amount and on interest previously earned

The Future Value Equation
Let’s continue our bank example. Suppose you decide to leave your money in the bank for three years. Looking back at equations for a single-period and a two-period investment, you can probably guess that the equation for the future value of money invested for three years would be:

With this pattern clearly established, we can see that the general equation to find the future value after any number of periods is as follows:

which is often written as:

(5.1)
where:

FVn	=	future value of investment at the end of period n
PV	=	original principal (P0); this is often called the present value, or PV
i	=	the rate of interest per period
n	=	the number of periods; a period can be a year, a quarter, a month, a day, or some other unit of time
(1 + i)n	=	the future value factor
Let’s test our general equation. Suppose you leave your $100 invested in the bank savings account at 10 percent interest for five years. How much would you have in the bank at the end of five years? Applying Equation 5.1 yields the following:

Exhibit 5.2 shows how the interest is earned on a year-by-year basis. Notice that the total compound interest earned over the five-year period is $61.05 (column 5) and that it is made up of two parts: (1) $50.00 of simple interest (column 3) and (2) $11.05 of interest on interest (column 4). Thus, the total compound interest can be expressed as follows:

The simple interest earned is $100 × 0.10 = $10.00 per year, and thus the total simple interest for the five-year period is $50.00 (5 years × $10.00 = $50.00). The remaining balance of $11.05 ($61.05 − $50.00 = $11.05) comes from earning interest on interest.

A helpful equation for calculating simple interest can be derived by using the future value equation for a single-period investment and solving for the term FV1 − P0:

where SI is the simple interest earned. Thus, the calculation for simple interest is:2

Exhibit 5.3 shows graphically how the compound interest in Exhibit 5.2 grows. Notice that the simple interest earned each year remains constant at $10 per year, but that the amount of interest on interest increases every year. The reason, of course, is that interest on interest increases with the cumulative interest that has been earned. As more and more interest is earned, the compounding of interest accelerates the growth of the interest on interest and therefore the total interest earned.

EXHIBIT 5.3 How Compound Interest Grows on $100 at 10 Percent The amount of simple interest earned on $100 invested at 10 percent remains constant at $10 per year, but the amount of interest earned on interest increases each year. As more and more interest builds, the effect of compounding accelerates the growth of the total interest earned.


EXHIBIT 5.4 Future Value of $1 for Different Periods and Interest Rates The higher the interest rate, the faster the value of an investment will grow, and the larger the amount of money that will accumulate over time. Because of compounding, the growth over time is not linear but exponential—the dollar increase in the future value is greater in each subsequent period.


An interesting observation about Equation 5.1 is that the higher the interest rate, the faster the investment will grow. This fact can be seen in Exhibit 5.4, which shows the growth in the future value of $1.00 at different interest rates and for different time periods into the future. First, notice that the growth in the future value over time is exponential, not linear. The dollar value of the invested funds does not increase by the same dollar amount from year to year. It increases by a greater amount each year. In other words, the growth of the invested funds is accelerated by the compounding of interest. Second, the higher the interest rate, the more the monies accumulated for any time period. Looking at the right side of the exhibit, you can see the difference in total dollars accumulated if you invest a dollar for 10 years: At 5 percent, you will have $1.63; at 10 percent, you will have $2.59; at 15 percent, you will have $4.05; and at 20 percent, you will have $6.19. Finally, as you should expect, if you invest a dollar at 0 percent for 10 years, you will only have a dollar at the end of the 10 years.

Using a Calculator to Compute the Future Value Factor
To solve a future value problem, we need to know the future value factor, (1 + i)n. Fortunately, almost any calculator has a power key (the yx key) that we can use to make this computation. For example, to compute (1.08)10, we enter 1.08, press the yx key and enter 10, and press the = key. The number 2.159 should emerge. Give it a try with your calculator.

Future Value Factor Tables
Before calculators and spreadsheets became widely available, a financial analyst would typically use a future value factor table to obtain the factor for a future value calculation. Doing this reduced the necessary calculation to the simple multiplication of the present value by the future value factor—something that could easily be done by hand. A future value factor table, an example of which is provided in Table A-1 in Appendix A at the back of this book, provides future value factors for a range of interest rates and years. While such tables are no longer commonly used, you might find the one at the back of this book useful in checking some of the calculations that you do throughout this course.

Applying the Future Value Formula
Next, we will review a number of examples of future value problems to illustrate the typical types of problems you will encounter in business and in your personal life.

The Power of Compounding

Our first example illustrates the effects of compounding. Suppose you have an opportunity to make a $5,000 investment that pays 15 percent per year. How much money will you have at the end of 10 years? The time line for the investment opportunity is:


where the $5,000 investment is a cash outflow and the future value you will receive in 10 years is a cash inflow.

We can apply Equation 5.1 to find the future value of $5,000 invested for 10 years at 15 percent interest. We want to multiply the original principal amount (PV) times the appropriate future value factor for 10 years at 15 percent, which is (1 + 0.15)10; thus:

Now let’s determine how much of the interest is from simple interest and how much is from interest on interest. The total compound interest earned is $15,227.79 ($20,227.79 − $5,000.00 = $15,227.79). The simple interest is the amount of interest paid on the original principal amount: SI = P0 × i = $5,000 × 0.15 = $750 per year, which over 10 years is $750 × 10 years = $7,500. The interest on interest must be the difference between the total compound interest earned and the simple interest: $15,227.79 − $7,500 = $7,727.79. Notice how quickly the value of an investment increases and how the reinvestment of interest earned impacts the total compound interest when the interest rate is high.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 5.1
The Power of Compounding

Problem

Your wealthy uncle passed away, and one of the assets he left to you was a savings account that your great-grandfather had set up 100 years ago. The account had a single deposit of $1,000 and paid 10 percent interest per year. How much money have you inherited, what is the total compound interest, and how much of the interest earned came from interest on interest?





As Learning by Doing Application 5.1 indicates, the relative importance of interest earned on interest is especially great for long-term investments. For many people, retirement savings will be some of the longest investments they will make. As you might expect, interest earned on interest has a great impact on how much money people ultimately have for their retirement. For example, consider someone who inherits and invests $10,000 on her 25th birthday and earns 8 percent per year for the next 40 years. This investment will grow to:

Building Intuition
Compounding Drives Much of the Earnings on Long-Term Investments

The earnings from compounding drive much of the return earned on a long-term investment. The reason is that the longer the investment period, the greater the proportion of total earnings from interest earned on interest. Interest earned on interest grows exponentially as the investment period increases.

by the investor’s 65th birthday. In contrast, if the same individual waited until her 35th birthday to invest the $10,000, she would have only:

when she turned 65.

Of the $116,618.65 difference in these amounts, the difference in simple interest accounts for only $8,000 (10 years × $10,000 × 0.08 = $8,000). The remaining $108,618.65 is attributable to the difference in interest earned on interest. This example illustrates both the importance of compounding for investment returns and the importance of getting started early when saving for retirement. The sooner you start saving, the better off you will be when you retire.

Compounding More Frequently Than Once a Year

Interest can be compounded more frequently than once a year. In Equation 5.1, the term n represents the number of periods. These periods can be of any length. They can be a year, a quarter, a month, a week, or even a day. The shorter the period, the more frequently interest payments are compounded, and the larger the future value of $1 for a given time period. Equation 5.1 can be rewritten to explicitly recognize different compounding periods:

(5.2)
where m is the number of times per year that interest is compounded and n is the number of periods specified in years.

Let’s say you invest $100 in a bank account that pays a 5 percent interest rate semiannually (2.5 percent twice a year) for two years. In other words, the annual rate quoted by the bank is 5 percent, but the bank calculates the interest it pays you based on a six-month rate of 2.5 percent. In this example there are four six-month periods, and the amount of principal and interest you would have at the end of the four periods would be:

It is not necessary to memorize Equation 5.2; using Equation 5.1 will do fine. All you have to do is determine the interest paid per compounding period (i/m) and calculate the total number of compounding periods (m × n) as the exponent for the future value factor. For example, if the bank compounds interest quarterly, then both the interest rate and number of compounding periods must be expressed in quarterly terms: (i/4) and (4 × n).

If the bank in the preceding example paid interest annually instead of semiannually, you would have:

at the end of the two-year period. The difference between this amount and the $110.38 is due to the additional interest earned on interest when the compounding period is shorter and the interest payments are compounded more frequently.

During the late 1960s, the effects of compounding periods became an issue in banking. At that time, the interest rates that banks and thrift institutions could pay on consumer savings accounts were limited by regulation. However, financial institutions discovered they could keep their rates within the legal limit and pay their customers additional interest by increasing the compounding frequency. Prior to this, banks and thrifts had paid interest on savings accounts quarterly. You can see the difference between quarterly and daily compounding in Learning by Doing Application 5.2.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 5.2
Changing the Compounding Period

Problem

Your grandmother has $10,000 she wants to put into a bank savings account for five years. The bank she is considering is within walking distance, pays 5 percent annual interest compounded quarterly (5 percent per year/4 quarters per year = 1.25 percent per quarter), and provides a free coffee bar and doughnuts in the morning. Another bank in town pays 5 percent interest compounded daily. Getting to this bank requires a bus trip, but your grandmother can ride free as a senior citizen. More important, though, this bank does not serve coffee and doughnuts. Which bank should your grandmother select?





Continuous Compounding

We can continue to divide the compounding interval into smaller and smaller time periods, such as minutes and seconds, until, at the extreme, we would compound continuously. In this case, m in Equation 5.2 would approach infinity (∞). The formula to compute the future value for continuous compounding (FV∞) is:

(5.3)
where e is the exponential function, which has a known mathematical value of about 2.71828, n is the number of periods specified in years, and i is the annual interest rate. Although the formula may look a little intimidating, it is really quite easy to apply. Look for a key on your calculator labeled ex. If you don’t have the key, you still can work the problem.

Let’s go back to the example in Learning by Doing Application 5.2, in which your grandmother wants to put $10,000 in a savings account at a bank. How much money would she have at the end of five years if the bank paid 5 percent annual interest compounded continuously? To find out, we enter these values into Equation 5.3:

If your calculator has an exponent key, all you have to do to calculate e0.25 is enter the number 0.25, then press the ex key, and the number 1.284025 should appear (depending on your calculator, you may have to press the equal [=] key for the answer to appear). Then multiply 1.284025 by $10,000, and you’re done! If your calculator does not have an exponent key, then you can calculate e0.25 by inputting the value of e (2.71828) and raising it to the 0.25 power using the yx key, as described earlier in this chapter.

Let’s look at your grandmother’s $10,000 bank balance at the end of five years with several different compounding periods: yearly, quarterly, daily, and continuous:3

(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)
Compounding Period	Total Earnings	Compound Interest	Additional Interest
Yearly	$12,762.82	$2,762.82	—
Quarterly	$12,820.37	$2,820.37	$57.55 more than yearly compounding
Daily	$12,840.03	$2,840.03	$19.66 more than quarterly compounding
Continuous	$12,840.25	$2,840.25	$0.22 more than daily compounding
Notice that your grandmother’s total earnings get larger as the frequency of compounding increases, as shown in column 2, but the earnings increase at a decreasing rate, as shown in column 4. The biggest gain comes when the compounding period goes from an annual interest payment to quarterly interest payments. The gain from daily compounding to continuous compounding is small on a modest savings balance such as your grandmother’s. Twenty-two cents over five years will not buy your grandmother a cup of coffee, let alone a doughnut. However, for businesses and governments with very large dollar balances at financial institutions, the difference in compounding periods can be substantial.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 5.1
Which Bank Offers Depositors the Best Deal?

Situation

You have just received a bonus of $10,000 and are looking to deposit the money in a bank account for five years. You investigate the annual deposit rates of several banks and collect the following information:

Bank	Compounding Frequency	Annual Rate
A	Annually	5.00%
B	Quarterly	5.00%
C	Monthly	4.80%
D	Daily	4.85%
You understand that the more frequently interest is compounded in each year, the more you will have at the end of your five-year investment horizon. To determine in which bank you should deposit your money, you calculate how much money you will have at the end of five years at each bank. You apply Equation 5.2 and obtain the following results. Which bank should you choose?

Bank	Investment Amount	Compounding Frequency	Annual Rate	Value after 5 Years
A	$10,000	Annually	5.00%	$12,762.82
B	$10,000	Quarterly	5.00%	$12,820.37
C	$10,000	Monthly	4.80%	$12,706.41
D	$10,000	Daily	4.85%	$12,744.11


Decision Making Example 5.1 provides another illustration of how compounding period can affect investment choice.

Calculator Tips for Future Value Problems
As we have mentioned, all types of future value calculations can be done easily on a financial calculator. Here we discuss how to solve these problems, and we identify some potential problem areas to avoid.

A financial calculator includes the following five basic keys for solving future value and present value problems:


The keys represent the following inputs:

N is the number of periods. The periods can be years, quarters, months, days, or some other unit of time.
i is the interest rate per period, expressed as a percentage.
PV is the present value or the original principal (P0).
PMT is the amount of any recurring payment.4
FV is the future value.
Given any four of these inputs, the financial calculator will solve for the fifth. Note that the interest rate key i differs with different calculator brands: Texas Instruments uses the I/Y key; Hewlett-Packard an i, %i, or I/Y key; and Sharp the i key.

For future value problems, we use only four of the five keys: N for the number of periods, i for the interest rate (or growth rate), PV for the present value (at time zero), and FV for the future value in n periods. The PMT key is not used, but, when working on a problem, you should always enter a zero for PMT to clear the register.

To solve a future value problem, enter the known data into your calculator. For example, if you know that the number of periods is five, key in 5 and press the N key. Repeat the process for the remaining known values. Once you have entered all of the values you know, then press the key for the unknown quantity, and you have your answer. Note that with some calculators, including the TI BA II Plus, you get the answer by first pressing the key labeled CPT (compute).

Let’s try a problem to see how this works. Suppose we invest $5,000 at 15 percent for 10 years. How much money will we have in 10 years? To solve the problem, we enter data on the keys as displayed in the following calculation and solve for FV. Note that the initial investment of $5,000 is a negative number because it represents a cash outflow. Use the +/− key to make a number negative.


If you did not get the correct answer of $20,227.79, you may need to consult the instruction manual that came with your financial calculator. However, before you do that, you may want to look through Exhibit 5.5, which lists the most common problems with using financial calculators. Also, note again that PMT is entered as zero to clear the register.

One advantage of using a financial calculator is that if you have values for any three of the four variables in Equation 5.1, you can solve for the remaining variable at the press of a button. Suppose that you have an opportunity to invest $5,000 in a bank and that the bank will pay you $20,227.79 at the end of 10 years. What interest rate does the bank pay? The time line for our situation is as follows:


EXHIBIT 5.5 Tips for Using Financial Calculators

Following these tips will help you avoid problems that sometimes arise in solving time value of money problems with a financial calculator.
Use the Correct Compounding Period. Make sure that your calculator is set to compound one payment per period or per year. Because financial calculators are often used to compute monthly payments, some will default to monthly payments unless you indicate otherwise. You will need to consult your calculator’s instruction manual because procedures for changing settings vary by manufacturer. Most of the problems you will work in other chapters of this book will compound annually.

Clear the Financial Register of the Calculator Before Starting. Be sure you clear the data from the financial register before starting to work a problem because most calculators retain information between calculations. Since the information may be retained even when the calculator is turned off, turning the calculator off and on will not solve this problem. Check your instruction manual for the correct procedure for clearing the financial register of your calculator.

Ensure the Signs on Cash Outflows and Inflows Are Consistent. For certain types of calculations, you must input a negative (positive) sign for all cash outflows and a positive (negative) sign for all cash inflows. Otherwise, the calculator cannot make the computation, and the answer screen will display an error message, or the answer will be incorrect.

Putting a Negative Sign on a Number. To create a number with a negative sign, enter the number first and then press the “change of sign key.” These keys are typically labeled “CHS” or “+/−”.

Entering an Interest Rate as a Percentage. Most financial calculators require that interest rate data be entered in percentage form, not in decimal form. For example, enter 7.125 percent as 7.125 and not 0.07125. Unlike nonfinancial calculators, financial calculators assume that rates are stated as percentages.

Rounding Off Numbers. Never round off any numbers until all your calculations are complete. If you round off numbers along the way, you can generate significant rounding errors.

Adjusting the Decimal Setting. Most calculators are set to display two decimal places. You will find it convenient at times to display four or more decimal places when making financial calculations, especially when working with interest rates or present value factors. Again, consult your instruction manual.

Having the mode correctly set to BEG or END. In finance, most problems that you solve will involve cash payments that occur at the end of each time period. Most calculators normally operate in this mode, which is usually designated as “END” mode. However, in some problems the cash payments occur at the beginning of each period. This setting is designated as the “BEG” mode. When your financial calculator was purchased, it was set in the END mode. Financial calculators allow you to switch between the END and BEG modes.

We know the values for N (10 years), PV ($5,000), and FV ($20,227.79), so we can enter these values into our financial calculator:


Press the interest rate (i) key, and 15.00 percent appears as the answer. Notice that the cash outflow ($5,000) was entered as a negative value and the cash inflow ($20,227.79) as a positive value. If both values were entered with the same sign, your financial calculator algorithm could not compute the equation, yielding an error message. Go ahead and try it.

The following Using Excel Example illustrates the use of a computer spreadsheet to compute future values with different compounding rates.

Using Excel
Time Value of Money

Spreadsheet applications are a popular method for setting up and solving finance and accounting problems. Throughout this book, we will show you how to structure and calculate some problems using Microsoft Excel. Spreadsheets are like your financial calculator but are especially efficient at doing repetitive calculations. For example, once the spreadsheet is set up, it will allow you to make computations using preprogrammed formulas. Thus, you can simply change any of the input cells, and the preset formula will automatically recalculate the answer based on the new input values. For this reason, we recommend that you use formulas whenever possible.

We begin our spreadsheet examples with time value of money calculations. As with the financial calculator approach, there are five variables used in these calculations, and knowing any four of them will let you calculate the fifth one. Excel includes preset formulas for you to use. These are as follows:

Solving for	Formula
Present Value	= PV(RATE, NPER, PMT, FV)
Future Value	= FV(RATE, NPER, PMT, PV)
Discount Rate	= RATE(NPER, PMT, PV, FV)
Payment	= PMT(RATE, NPER, PV, FV)
Number of Periods	= NPER(RATE, PMT, PV, FV)
To enter a formula, all you have to do is type in the equal sign, the abbreviated name of the variable you want to compute, and an open parenthesis, and Excel will automatically prompt you to enter the rest of the variables. Here is an example of what you would type to compute the future value:

=
FV
(
Here are a few important things to note when entering the formulas: (1) be consistent with signs for cash inflows and outflows; (2) enter the rate of return as a decimal number, not a percentage; and (3) enter the amount of an unknown payment as zero.

5.3 Present Value and Discounting
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the concept of present value and how it relates to future value, and use the present value formula to make business decisions.
In our discussion of future value, we asked the question “If you put $100 in a bank savings account that pays 10 percent annual interest, how much money would you have in one year?” Another type of question that arises frequently in finance concerns present value. This question asks, “What is the value today of a cash flow promised in the future?” We’ll illustrate the present value concept with a simple example.

Single-Period Investment
Suppose that a rich uncle gives you a bank certificate of deposit (CD) that matures in one year and pays $110. The CD pays 10 percent interest annually and cannot be redeemed until maturity. Being a student, you need the money now and would like to sell the CD. What would be a fair price if you sold the CD today?

From our earlier discussion, we know that if we invest $100 in a bank at 10 percent for one year, it will grow to a future value of $100 × (1 + 0.10) = $110. It seems reasonable to conclude that if a CD has an interest rate of 10 percent and will have a value of $110 a year from now, it is worth $100 today.

More formally, to find the present value of a future cash flow, or its value today, we reverse the compounding process and divide the future value ($110) by the future value factor (1 + 0.10). The result is $110/(1 + 0.10) = $100, which is the same answer we derived from our intuitive calculation. If we write the calculations above as a formula, we have a one-period model for calculating the present value of a future cash flow:

The numerical calculation for the present value (PV) from our one-period model follows:

We have noted that while future value calculations involve compounding an amount forward into the future, present value calculations involve the reverse. That is, present value calculations involve determining the current value (or present value) of a future cash flow. The process of calculating the present value is called discounting, and the interest rate i is known as the discount rate. Accordingly, the present value (PV) can be thought of as the discounted value of a future amount. The present value is simply the current value of a future cash flow that has been discounted at the appropriate discount rate.

discounting the process by which the present value of future cash flows is obtained

discount rate the interest rate used in the discounting process to find the present value of future cash flows

present value (PV) the current value of a future cash flow discounted at the appropriate discount rate

Just as we have a future value factor, (1 + i), we also have a present value factor, which is more commonly called the discount factor. The discount factor, which is 1/(1 + i), is the reciprocal of the future value factor. This expression may not be obvious in the equation above, but note that we can write that equation in two ways:

These equations represent the same calculation, but the discount factor is explicit in the second one.

Multiple-Period Investment
Now suppose your uncle gives you another 10 percent CD, but this CD matures in two years and pays $121 at maturity. Like the other CD, it cannot be redeemed until maturity. From the previous section, we know that if we invest $100 in a bank at 10 percent for two years, it will grow to a future value of $100 × (1 + 0.10)2 = $121. To calculate the present value, or today’s price, we divide the future value by the future value factor. If we write this as an equation, the result is a two-period model for computing the present value of a future cash flow:

Plugging the data from our example into the equation yields:

By now, you know the drill. We can extend the equation to a third year as:

and so on for the fourth year and beyond.

The Present Value Equation
Given the pattern shown above, we can see that the general formula for the present value equation is:

(5.4)
where:

PV	=	the value today (time zero) of a cash flow
FVn	=	the future value at the end of period n
i	=	the discount rate, which is the interest rate per period
n	=	the number of periods, which can be years, quarters, months, days, or some other unit of time
Note that Equation 5.4 can be written in slightly different ways, which we will sometimes do in this book. The first form, introduced earlier, separates out the discount factor, 1/(1 + i):5

In the second form, DFn is the discount factor for the nth period: DFn = 1/(1 + i)n:

Future and Present Value Equations Are the Same
Equation 5.4 is just a restatement of the future value equation, Equation 5.1. That is, to get the future value (FVn) of funds invested for n years, we multiply the original investment by (1 + i)n. To find the present value of a future payment (PV), we divide FVn by (1 + i)n. Stated another way, we can start with the future value equation (Equation 5.1), FVn = PV × (1 + i)n, and then solve it for PV; the resulting equation is the present value equation (Equation 5.4), PV = FVn/(1 + i)n.

EXHIBIT 5.6 Comparing Future Value and Present Value Calculations The future value and present value formulas are one and the same; the present value factor, 1/(1 + i)n, is just the reciprocal of the future value factor, (1 + i)n.


Exhibit 5.6 illustrates the relation between the future value and present value calculations for $100 invested at 10 percent interest. You can see from the exhibit that present value and future value are just two sides of the same coin. The formula used to calculate the present value is really the same as the formula for future value, just rearranged.

Applying the Present Value Formula
Let’s work through some examples to see how the present value equation is used. Suppose you are interested in buying a new sports coupe a year from now. You estimate that the car will cost $40,000. If your local bank pays 5 percent interest on savings deposits, how much money will you need to save in order to buy the car as planned? The time line for the car purchase problem is as follows:


Solving this problem involves a direct application of Equation 5.4. What we want to know is how much money you have to put in the bank today to have $40,000 a year from now to buy your car. To find out, we compute the present value of $40,000 using a 5 percent discount rate:

If you put $38,095.24 in a bank savings account at 5 percent today, you will have the $40,000 to buy the car in one year.

Since that’s a lot of money to come up with, your mother suggests that you leave the money in the bank for two years instead of one year. If you follow her advice, how much money do you need to invest? The time line is as follows:


For a two-year waiting period, assuming the car price will stay the same, the calculation is:

Given the time value of money, the result is exactly what we would expect. The present value of $40,000 two years out is lower than the present value of $40,000 one year out—$36,281.18 compared with $38,095.24. Thus, if you are willing to leave your money in the bank for two years instead of one, you can make a smaller initial investment to reach your goal.

Now suppose your rich neighbor says that if you invest your money with her for one year, she will pay you 15 percent interest. The time line is:


The calculation for the initial investment at this new rate is as follows:

Thus, when the interest rate, or discount rate, is 15 percent, the present value of $40,000 to be received in a year’s time is $34,782.61, compared with $38,095.24 at a rate of 5 percent and a time of one year. Holding the number of periods constant, an increase in the discount rate decreases the present value of the future cash flow. This makes sense because when interest rates are higher, it is more valuable to have dollars in hand today to invest; thus, dollars in the future are worth less.

Learning by Doing Application 5.3 shows another present valuation calculation.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 5.3
European Graduation Trip

Problem

Suppose you plan to take a vacation to Europe when you graduate from college in two years. If your savings account at the bank pays 6 percent, how much money do you need to set aside today to have $8,000 when you leave for Europe?





The Relations Among Time, the Discount Rate, and Present Value
From our discussion so far, we can see that (1) the farther in the future a dollar will be received, the less it is worth today, and (2) the higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of a dollar to be received in the future. Let’s look a bit more closely at these relations.

Recall from Exhibit 5.4 that the future value of a dollar increases with time because of compounding. In contrast, the present value of a dollar becomes smaller the farther into the future that dollar is to be received. The reason is that the present value factor 1/(1 + i)n is the reciprocal of the future value factor (1 + i)n. Thus, the present value of $1 must become smaller the farther into the future that dollar is to be received.

Exhibit 5.7 shows the present values of $1 for different time periods and discount rates. For example, the present value of $1 discounted at 5 percent for 10 years is 61 cents, at 10 percent it is 39 cents, and at 20 percent, 16 cents. Thus, the higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of $1 for a given time period. Exhibit 5.7 also shows that, just as with future value, the relation between the present value of $1 and time is not linear, but exponential. Finally, it is worth noting that if interest rates are zero, the present value of $1 is $1; that is, there is no time value of money. In this situation, $1,000 today has the same value as $1,000 a year from now or, for that matter, 10 years from now.

Calculator Tips for Present Value Problems
Calculating the discount factor (present value factor) on a calculator is similar to calculating the future value factor but requires an additional keystroke on most calculators because the discount factor, 1/(1 + i)n, is the reciprocal of the future value factor, (1 + i)n. The additional keystroke involves the use of the reciprocal key (1/x) to find the discount factor. For example, to compute 1/(1.08)10, first enter 1.08, press the yx key and enter 10, then press the equal (=) key. The number on the screen should be 2.159. This is the future value factor. It is a calculation you have made before. Now press the 1/x key, then the equal key, and you have the present value factor, 0.463!

EXHIBIT 5.7 Present Value of $1 for Different Time Periods and Discount Rates The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of $1 for a given time period. Just as with future value, the relation between the present value and time is not linear, but exponential.


Calculating the present value (PV) on a financial calculator is the same as calculating the future value (FVn) except that you solve for PV rather than FVn. For example, what is the present value of $1,000 received 10 years from now at a 9 percent discount rate? To find the answer on your financial calculator, enter the following keystrokes:


then solve for the present value (PV), which is −$422.41. Notice that the answer has a negative sign. As we discussed previously, the $1,000 represents an inflow, and the $442.41 represents an outflow.

Note that, just as financial analysts used future value factor tables to help with calculations before calculators and spreadsheets became widely available, they also used present value (discount) factor tables. Table A-2 in Appendix A at the back of this book is an example of such a table.

Decision Making Example 5.2 illustrates another application of the present value concept.

Future Value Versus Present Value
We can analyze financial decisions using either future value or present value techniques. Although the two techniques approach the decision differently, both yield the same result. Both techniques focus on the valuation of cash flows received over time. In corporate finance, future value problems typically measure the value of cash flows at the end of a project, whereas present value problems measure the value of cash flows at the start of a project (time zero).

EXHIBIT 5.8 Future Value and Present Value Compared Compounding converts a present value into its future value, taking into account the time value of money. Discounting is just the reverse—it converts future cash flows into their present value.


Exhibit 5.8 compares the $10,000 investment decision shown in Exhibit 5.1 in terms of future value and present value. When managers are making a decision about whether to accept a project, they must look at all of the cash flows associated with that project with reference to the same point in time. As Exhibit 5.8 shows, for most business decisions, that point is either the start (time zero) or the end of the project (in this example, Year 5).

5.4 Additional Concepts and Applications
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss why the concept of compounding is not restricted to money, and use the future value formula to calculate growth rates.
In this final section, we discuss several additional issues concerning present and future value, including how to find an unknown interest rate, the time required for an investment to grow by a certain amount, a rule of thumb for estimating the length of time it will take to “double your money,” and how to find the growth rates of various kinds of investments.

Finding the Interest Rate
In finance, some situations require you to determine the interest rate (or discount rate) for a given future cash flow. These situations typically arise when you want to determine the return on an investment. Consider a zero coupon bond, which is essentially a loan that pays no periodic interest. The issuer (the firm that borrows the money) makes a single payment when the bond matures (the loan is due) that includes repayment of the amount borrowed plus all of the interest. Needless to say, the issuer must prepare in advance to have the cash to pay the bondholders.

Suppose a firm is planning to issue $10 million worth of zero coupon bonds with 20 years to maturity. The bonds are issued in denominations of $1,000 and are sold for $90 each. In other words, the investor buys a bond today for $90, and 20 years from now the firm pays the investor $1,000. If you bought one of these bonds, what would be your return on investment?


To find the return, we need to solve Equation 5.1, the future value equation, for i, the interest, or discount, rate. The $90 you pay today is the PV (present value), the $1,000 you get in 20 years is the FV (future value), and n (number of periods) is 20 years. The calculation is as follows:

The rate of return on your investment, compounded annually, is 12.79 percent. Using a financial calculator, we arrive at the following solution:

Interest Rate on a Loan

Problem

If Greg and Joan borrow the money, they will have to repay Greg’s aunt the amount of $23,750. What rate of interest would Greg and Joan be paying on the 10-year loan?





Finding How Many Periods It Takes an Investment to Grow to a Certain Amount
Up to this point we have used variations of Equation 5.1:

to calculate the future value of an investment (FVn), the present value of an investment (PV), and the interest rate necessary for an initial investment (the present value) to grow to a specific value (the future value) over a certain number of periods (i). Note that Equation 5.1 has a total of four variables. You may have noticed that in all of the previous calculations, we took advantage of the mathematical principle that if we know the values of three of these variables we can calculate the value of the fourth.

The same principle allows us to calculate the number of periods (n) that it takes an investment to grow to a certain amount. This is a more complicated calculation than the calculations of the values of the other three variables, but it is an important one for you to know and understand.

Suppose that you would like to purchase a new motorcycle to ride on dirt trails near campus. The motorcycle dealer will finance the bike that you are interested in if you make a down payment of $1,175. Right now you only have $1,000. If you can earn 5 percent by investing your money, how long will it take for your $1,000 to grow to $1,175?

To find this length of time, we must solve Equation 5.1, the future value equation, for n.

It will take 3.31 years for your investment to grow to $1,175. If you don’t want to wait this long to get your motorcycle, you cannot rely on your investment earnings alone. You will have to put aside some additional money.

Note that because n is an exponent in the future value formula, we have to take the natural logarithm, ln(x), of both sides of the equation in the fourth line of the preceding calculations to compute the value of n directly. Your financial calculator should have a key that allows you to calculate natural logarithms. Just enter the value in the parentheses and then press the LN key.

Using a financial calculator, we obtain the same solution.


The Rule of 72
People are fascinated by the possibility of doubling their money. For example, you have probably seen infomercials that tout speculative land and other investments, often claiming that some investors have doubled their money in a short period of time, such as four years. Before there were financial calculators, people used rules of thumb to approximate difficult present value calculations. One such rule is the Rule of 72, which was used to determine the approximate amount of time it takes to double the value of an investment. The Rule of 72 says that the time to double your money (TDM) approximately equals 72/i, where i is the rate of return expressed as a percentage. Thus:

(5.5)
Rule of 72 a rule proposing that the time required to double an amount of money (TDM) approximately equals 72/i, where i is the rate of return expressed as a percentage

Applying the Rule of 72 to the preceding investment example suggests that if you double your money in four years, your annual rate of return will be 18 percent (i = 72/4 years = 18 percent).

Let’s check the rule’s accuracy by applying the future value formula to the speculative land investment example. We are assuming that we will double our money in four years, so n = 4 years. We did not specify a present value or future value amount; however, doubling our money means that we will get back $2 (FV) for every $1 invested (PV). Using Equation 5.1 and solving for the interest rate (i), we find that i = 0.1892, or 18.92 percent.6

That’s not bad for a simple rule of thumb: 18.92 percent versus 18 percent. Within limits, the Rule of 72 provides a quick method for determining approximately how long it will take to double an investment for a particular rate of return. The Rule of 72 is a linear approximation of a nonlinear function, and as such, the rule is fairly accurate for interest rates between 5 and 20 percent. Outside these limits, the rule is not very accurate.

Compound Growth Rates
The concept of compounding is not restricted to money. Any number that changes over time, such as the population of a city, changes at some compound growth rate. Compound growth occurs when the initial value of a number increases or decreases each period by the factor (1 + growth rate). As we go through the book, we will discuss many different types of interest rates, such as the discount rate on capital budgeting projects, the yield on a bond, and the internal rate of return on an investment. All of these interest rates can be thought of as growth rates (g) that relate future values to present values.

When we refer to the compounding effect, we are really talking about what happens when the value of a number increases or decreases by (1 + growth rate)n. That is, the future value of a number after n periods will equal the initial value times (1 + growth rate)n. Does this sound familiar? We can also rewrite Equation 5.1 in a more general form as a compound growth rate formula, substituting g, the growth rate, for i, the interest rate:

(5.6)
where:

FVn	=	future value of the economic factor, such as sales or population, at the end of period n
PV	=	original amount or present value of the economic factor
g	=	growth rate per period
n	=	number of periods, which can be years, quarters, months, weeks, days, minutes, or some other unit of time
Suppose, for example, that because of an advertising campaign, a firm’s sales increased from 20 million units in 2017 to more than 35 million units in 2020. What has been the average annual growth rate in unit sales? Here, the future value is 35 million, the present value is 20 million, and n is 3 since we are interested in the average annual growth rate over three years. The time line is:


Applying Equation 5.6 and solving for the growth factor (g) yields:

Thus, unit sales grew nearly 21 percent per year. More precisely, we could say that unit sales grew at an average annual growth rate, or compound annual growth rate (CAGR), of nearly 21 percent. If we use our financial calculator, we find the same answer:


compound annual growth rate (CAGR) the average annual growth rate over a specified period of time

Note that we enter 20 million as a negative number even though it is not a cash outflow. This is because one value must be negative when using a financial calculator. It makes no difference which number is negative and which is positive.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Explain the concept of time value of money and why it is so important in the field of finance.

The idea that money has a time value is one of the most fundamental concepts in the field of finance. The concept is based on the idea that most people prefer to consume goods today rather than wait to have similar goods in the future. Since money buys goods, they would rather have money today than in the future. Thus, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar received in the future. Another way of viewing the time value of money is that your money is worth more today than at some point in the future because, if you had the money now, you could invest it and earn interest. Thus, the time value of money is the opportunity cost of forgoing consumption today.

Applications of the time value of money focus on the trade-off between current dollars and dollars received at some future date. This is an important element in financial decisions because most investment decisions require the comparison of cash invested today with the value of expected future cash inflows. Time value of money calculations facilitate such comparisons by accounting for both the magnitude and timing of cash flows. Investment opportunities are undertaken only when the value of future cash inflows exceeds the cost of the investment (the initial cash outflow).

2 Explain the concept of future value, including the meaning of the terms principal, simple interest, and compound interest, and use the future value formula to make business decisions.

The future value is what the investment will be worth after earning interest for one or more periods. The principal is the amount of the investment. Simple interest is the interest paid on the original investment; the amount of simple interest remains constant from period to period. Compound interest includes not only simple interest but also interest earned on the reinvestment of previously earned interest, the so-called interest earned on interest. For future value calculations, the higher the interest rate, the faster the investment will grow. The application of the future value formula in business decisions is presented in Section 5.2.

3 Explain the concept of present value and how it relates to future value, and use the present value formula to make business decisions.

The present value is the value today of a future cash flow. Computing the present value involves discounting future cash flows back to the present at an appropriate discount rate. The process of discounting cash flows adjusts the cash flows for the time value of money. Computationally, the present value factor is the reciprocal of the future value factor, or 1/(1 + i). The calculation and application of the present value formula in business decisions is presented in Section 5.3.

4 Discuss why the concept of compounding is not restricted to money, and use the future value formula to calculate growth rates.

Any number of changes that are observed over time in the physical and social sciences follow a compound growth rate pattern. The future value formula can be used in calculating these growth rates, as illustrated in Section 5.4.

Notes
1 Mega Millions is operated by a consortium of the state lottery commissions in 45 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. To play the game, a player pays two dollars and picks five numbers from 1 to 70 and one additional number from 1 to 25 (the Mega Ball number). Twice a week, a machine mixes numbered balls and randomly selects six balls (five white balls and one Mega Ball), which determines the winning combination for that drawing. There are various winning combinations, but a ticket that matches all six numbers, including the Mega Ball number, is the jackpot winner.
2 Another helpful equation is the one that computes the total simple interest (TSI) over several periods: TSI = Number of periods × SI = Number of periods × (P0 × i).
3 The future value calculation for annual compounding is FV5 = $10,000 × (1.05)5 = $12,762.82.
4 The PMT key is used for annuity calculations, which we will discuss in Chapter 6.
5 Equation 5.4 can also be written as PV = FVn × (1 + i)−n.
6 Solve FVn = PV × (1 + i)n for i with FVn = $2, PV = $1, and n = 4 years.

On November 25, 2019, luxury retailer Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, also known as LVMH, announced its blockbuster acquisition agreement to acquire global jeweler Tiffany & Co. for a whopping $16.2 billion in cash. The deal offered the stockholders of Tiffany $135 per share, which was a substantial premium to the $90 per share market value for the stock just one month before. The combination of the two luxury-brand powerhouses seemed like a perfect match at the time. Management at LVMH praised the impending acquisition as one that would “strengthen LVMH’s position in jewelry and further increase its presence in the United States.” In addition, Tiffany would be a brand that would complement LVMH’s seventy-five “Houses,” which range from Dior to Dom Pérignon.

Unfortunately, Tiffany quickly lost its shine for LVMH. By Spring 2020, it was becoming clear that the Covid-19 pandemic was going to have a substantial negative impact on the worldwide market for luxury brands such as Tiffany. With the release of its financials in March, Tiffany forecasted what Reuters described as “a significant results hit this year as it temporarily shut stores and lost about half of its operating days in mainland China since the coronavirus outbreak.” By September 2020, LVMH had had enough. Citing a continued downturn in consumer demand, as well as threats of U.S. tariffs being imposed on imports of French goods, LVMH announced that it was terminating the deal. Lawyers on behalf of Tiffany immediately sued LVMH, calling on the courts to force LVMH to make good on the merger agreement.

Following months of rancorous litigation, Tiffany and LVMH announced in November 2020 that they had agreed to a new acquisition price of $131.5 per share in a deal expected to close in 2021. This new price represented a $425 million discount to the initial purchase agreement, a small concession to LVMH.

In the excitement of an acquisition proposal such as this, it is important not to lose sight of the central question: What are the shares of the target firm really worth? Investors invest in an asset—whether it is a financial asset like the shares of Tiffany, or a real asset like a capital project—because they expect the asset to be worth more than it costs. That’s how investors create value for themselves. The value of a financial or real asset is the sum of the discounted cash flows that it is expected to produce in the future. Thus, the crucial task for both LVMH and Tiffany management and stockholders was to estimate how the acquisition would change the value of the cash flows that they might expect to receive. This chapter, which discusses the discounting of future cash flows, presents fundamental tools that you will need to understand in order to answer questions such as what the Tiffany shares were worth and whether the acquisition of Tiffany was a good deal for LVMH stockholders.

Chapter Preview
In Chapter 5, we introduced the concept of the time value of money: Dollars today are more valuable than dollars to be received in the future. Starting with that concept, we developed the basics of simple interest, compound interest, and future value calculations. We then went on to discuss present value calculations and discounted cash flow analysis. This was all done in the context of a single cash flow.

In this chapter, we consider the value of multiple cash flows. Most business decisions, after all, involve a series of cash flows over time. For example, if Hatteras Hammocks, a North Carolina–based firm that manufactures hammocks, swings, and rockers, wants to consider building a new factory, the decision will require an analysis of the project’s expected cash flows over a number of periods. Initially, there will be large cash outlays to build and get the new factory operational. Thereafter, the project should produce cash inflows for many years. Because the cash flows occur over time, the analysis must consider the time value of money, discounting each of the cash flows by using the present value formula we discussed in Chapter 5.

We begin the chapter by describing calculations of future and present values for multiple cash flows. We then examine some situations in which future cash flows are level over time: These involve annuities, in which the cash flow stream goes on for a finite period, and perpetuities, in which the stream goes on forever. Next, we examine annuities and perpetuities in which the cash flows grow at a constant rate over time. These cash flows resemble common cash flow patterns encountered in business. Finally, we describe the effective annual interest rate and compare it with the annual percentage rate (APR), which is a rate that is used to describe the interest rate in consumer loans.

6.1 Multiple Cash Flows
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain why cash flows occurring at different times must be adjusted to reflect their value as of a common date before they can be compared, and compute the present value and the future value for multiple cash flows.
We begin our discussion of the value of multiple cash flows by calculating the future value and then the present value of multiple cash flows. These calculations, as you will see, are applications of the techniques you learned in Chapter 5.

EXHIBIT 6.1 Future Value of Two Cash Flows This exhibit shows a time line for two cash flows invested in a savings account that pays 10 percent interest annually. The total amount in the savings account after two years is $2,310, which is the sum of the future values of the two cash flows.


Future Value of Multiple Cash Flows
In Chapter 5, we worked through several examples that involved the future value of a lump sum of money invested in a savings account that paid 10 percent interest per year. But suppose you are investing more than one lump sum. Let’s say you put $1,000 in your bank savings account today and another $1,000 a year from now. If the bank continues to pay 10 percent interest per year, how much money will you have at the end of two years?

To solve this future value problem, we can use Equation 5.1: FVn = PV × (1 + i)n. First, however, we construct a time line so that we can see the magnitude and timing of the cash flows. As Exhibit 6.1 shows, there are two cash flows into the savings account. The first cash flow is invested for two years and compounds to a future value as follows:

The second cash flow earns simple interest for a single period only and grows to:

As Exhibit 6.1 shows, the total amount of money in the savings account after two years is the sum of these two amounts, which is $2,310 ($1,100 + $1,210 = $2,310).

Now suppose that you expand your investment horizon to three years and invest $1,000 today, $1,000 a year from now, and $1,000 at the end of two years. How much money will you have at the end of three years? First, we draw a time line to be sure that we have correctly identified the magnitude and timing of each cash flow. This is shown in Exhibit 6.2. Then we compute the future value of each of the individual cash flows using Equation 5.1. Finally, we add up the future values. The total future value is $3,641. The calculations are as follows:

EXHIBIT 6.2 Future Value of Three Cash Flows The exhibit shows a time line for an investment program with a three-year horizon. The value of the investment at the end of three years is $3,641, the sum of the future values of the three separate cash flows.


To summarize, solving future value problems with multiple cash flows involves a simple process. First, draw a time line to make sure that each cash flow is placed in the correct time period. Second, calculate the future value of each cash flow for its time period. Third, add up the future values.

Let’s use this process to solve a practical problem. Suppose you want to buy a condominium in three years and estimate that you will need $20,000 for a down payment. If the interest rate you can earn at the bank is 8 percent and you can save $3,000 now, $4,000 at the end of the first year, and $5,000 at the end of the second year, how much money will you have to obtain from other sources at the end of the third year to have a $20,000 down payment?

The time line for the future value calculation in this problem looks like this:


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the future value for each of the cash flows, add up these values, and then calculate the difference between this amount and the $20,000 needed for the down payment. Using Equation 5.1, we find that the future values of the cash flows at the end of the third year are:

At the end of the third year, you will have $13,844.74, so you will need an additional $6,155.26 ($20,000 − $13,844.74 = $6,155.26) at that time to make the down payment.

Learning by Doing Application 6.1 illustrates another future value calculation with multiple cash flows.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 6.1
Bidding on a Contract to Rebuild a Bridge

Problem

The firm you work for is considering bidding on a contract to rebuild an old bridge that has reached the end of its useful life. The two-year contract will pay the firm $1,100,000 at the end of the second year. The firm’s estimator believes that the project will require an initial expenditure of $700,000 for equipment. The expenses for Years 1 and 2 are estimated at $150,000 per year. Because the cash inflow of $1,100,000 at the end of the contract exceeds the total cash outflows of $1,000,000 ($700,000 + $150,000 + $150,000 = $1,000,000), the estimator believes that the firm should accept the job. Drawing on your knowledge of finance, you point out that the estimator’s decision process ignores the time value of money. Not fully understanding what you mean, the estimator asks you how the time value of money should be incorporated into the decision process. Assume that the appropriate interest rate is 8 percent.



 

Calculator Tip: Calculating the Future Value of Multiple Cash Flows

To calculate the future value of multiple cash flows with a financial calculator, we can use exactly the same process we used in Chapter 5. We simply calculate the future value of each of the individual cash flows, write down each computed future value, and add them up.

Alternatively, we can generally use a shortcut. More than likely, your financial calculator has a memory where you can store numbers; refer to your calculator’s instruction manual for the keys to use. For the preceding example, you would use your financial calculator’s memory (M) as follows: Calculate the future value of the first number, then store the value in the memory (M1); compute the second value, and store it in the memory (M2); compute the third value, and store it in the memory (M3). Finally, retrieve the three numbers from the memory and add them up (M1 + M2 + M3). The advantage of using the calculator’s memory is that you eliminate two potential sources of error: (1) writing down a number incorrectly and (2) making a mistake when adding up the numbers.

Present Value of Multiple Cash Flows
In business, we often need to compute the present value of a series of future cash flows. We do this, for example, to determine the market price of a bond, to decide whether to purchase a new machine, or to determine the value of a company. Solving present value problems involving multiple cash flows is similar to solving future value problems involving multiple cash flows. First, we prepare a time line so that we can see the magnitude and timing of the cash flows. Second, we calculate the present value of each individual cash flow using Equation 5.4: PV = FVn/(1 + i)n. Finally, we add up the present values. The sum of the present values of a stream of future cash flows is their current market price, or value. There is nothing new here!

Using the Present Value Equation

Let’s work through some examples to see how we can use Equation 5.4 to find the present value of multiple cash flows. Suppose that your best friend needs cash and offers to pay you $1,000 at the end of each of the next three years if you will give him $3,000 cash today. You realize that because of the time value of money, the cash flows he has promised to pay are worth less than $3,000. If the interest rate on similar loans is 7 percent, how much should you pay for the cash flows your friend is offering?

To solve the problem, we first construct a time line, as shown in Exhibit 6.3. Then, using Equation 5.4, we calculate the present value for each of the three cash flows, as follows:

If you view this transaction from a purely business perspective, you should not give your friend more than $2,624.32, which is the sum of the individual discounted cash flows.

EXHIBIT 6.3 Present Value of Three Cash Flows This exhibit shows the time line for a three-year loan with a payment of $1,000 at the end of each year and an annual interest rate of 7 percent. To calculate the value of the loan today, we compute the present value of each of the three cash flows and then add them up. The present value of the loan is $2,624.32.


Now let’s consider another example. Suppose you have the opportunity to buy a small business while you are in school. The business involves selling sandwiches, drinks, and snack foods from a food truck that you park around campus. The annual cash flows from the business have been predictable. You believe you can expand the business, and you estimate that cash flows will be as follows: $2,000 in the first year, $3,000 in the second and third years, and $4,000 in the fourth year. At the end of the fourth year, the business will be closed down because the truck and other equipment will need to be replaced. You did some research and found that a 10 percent discount rate would be appropriate. How much should you pay for the business?

To value the business, we compute the present value of the expected cash flows, discounted at 10 percent. The time line for the investment is:


We compute the present value of each cash flow and then add them up:

This tells us that the present value of the expected cash flows is $9,283.51. If you pay $9,283.51 for the business, you will earn a return of exactly 10 percent. Of course, you should buy the business for the lowest price possible, but you should never pay more than the $9,283.51 value today of the expected cash flows. If you do, you will be paying more than the investment is worth.

Learning by Doing Application 6.2, Learning by Doing Application 6.3, and Decision Making Example 6.1 illustrate additional present value calculations and their application in decision-making.

Calculator Tip: Calculating the Present Value of Multiple Cash Flows

To calculate the present value of future cash flows with a financial calculator, we use exactly the same process we used in finding the future value, except that we solve for the present value instead of the future value. We can compute the present values of the individual cash flows, save them in the calculator’s memory, and then add them up to obtain the total present value.

You should note that from this point forward we will use a different notation. Up to this point, we have used the notation FVn to represent a cash flow in period n. We have done this to stress that, for n > 0, we were referring to a future value. From this point on, we will use the notation CFn, instead of FVn, because the CFn notation is more commonly used by financial analysts. When you work through Learning by Doing Application 6.2, you will see the new notation.

6.2 Level Cash Flows: Annuities
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the difference between an ordinary annuity and an annuity due, and calculate the present value and the future value of an ordinary annuity and an annuity due.
In finance we commonly encounter contracts that call for the payment of equal amounts of cash over several time periods. For example, most business term loans and insurance policies require the holder to make a series of equal payments, usually monthly. Similarly, nearly all consumer loans, such as auto, personal, and home mortgage loans, call for equal monthly payments. Any financial contract that calls for equally spaced and level cash flows over a finite number of periods is called an annuity. If the cash flow payments continue forever, the contract is called a perpetuity. Most annuities are structured so that cash payments are received at the end of each period. Because this is the most common structure, these annuities are often called ordinary annuities.

annuity a series of equally spaced and level cash flows extending over a finite number of periods

perpetuity a series of equally spaced and level cash flows that continues forever

ordinary annuity an annuity in which payments are made at the end of each period

Present Value of an Annuity
We frequently need to find the present value of an annuity (PVA). Suppose, for example, that a financial contract pays $2,000 at the end of each year for three years and the appropriate discount rate is 8 percent. The time line for the contract is:


present value of an annuity (PVA) the present value of the cash flows from an annuity, discounted at the appropriate discount rate

What is the most we should pay for this annuity? We have worked problems like this one before. All we need to do is calculate the present value of each individual cash flow (CFn) and add them up. Using Equation 5.4, we find that the present value of the three-year annuity (PVA3) at 8 percent interest is:

This approach to computing the present value of an annuity works as long as the number of cash flows is relatively small. In many situations that involve annuities, however, the number of cash flows is large, and doing the calculations by hand would be tedious. For example, a typical 30-year home mortgage has 360 monthly payments (12 months per year × 30 years = 360 months).

Fortunately, our problem can be simplified because the cash flows (CF) for an annuity are all the same (CF1 = CF2 = … = CFn = CF). Thus, the present value of an annuity (PVAn) with n equal cash flows (CF) at interest rate i is the sum of the individual present value calculations:

With some mathematical manipulations that we discuss in the appendix to this chapter, we can simplify this equation to yield a useful formula for the present value of an annuity:

(6.1)
where:

PVAn	=	present value of an n period annuity
CF	=	equally spaced and level cash flow
i	=	discount rate, or interest rate
n	=	number of periods (often called the annuity’s maturity)
Notice in Equation 6.1 that 1/(1 + i)n is a term you have already encountered: It is the present value factor. Thus, we can also write Equation 6.1 as follows:

where the term on the right is what we call the PV annuity factor:

It follows that yet another way to state Equation 6.1 is:

Let’s apply Equation 6.1 to the example involving a three-year annuity with a $2,000 annual cash flow. To solve for PVAn, we first compute the PV annuity factor for three years at 8 percent. The calculation is made in two steps:

Calculate the present value factor for three years at 8 percent:
Use the present value factor to calculate the PV annuity factor:
We now can calculate PVA3 by plugging our values into the equation:

This is almost the same as the $5,154.19 we calculated by hand earlier. The difference is due to rounding.

Learning by Doing Application 6.4 illustrates another calculation of a PV anuity factor.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 6.4
Computing a PV Annuity Factor

Problem

Calculator Tip: Finding the Present Value of an Annuity

There are four variables in a present value of an annuity equation (PVAn, CF, n, and i), and if you know three of them, you can solve for the fourth in a few seconds with a financial calculator. The calculator key that you have not used so far is the PMT (payment) key, which is the key for level cash flows over the life of an annuity.

To illustrate problem solving with a financial calculator, we will revisit the financial contract that paid $2,000 per year for three years, discounted at 8 percent. To find the present value of the contract, we enter 8 percent for the interest rate (i), $2,000 for the payment (PMT), and 3 for the number of periods (N). The key for FV is not relevant for this calculation, so we enter zero into this register to clear it. The key entries and the answer are as follows:


The price of the contract is $5,154.19, which agrees with our other calculations. As discussed in Chapter 5, the negative sign on the financial calculator box indicates that $5,154.19 is a cash outflow.

PV Annuity Factor Tables

Just as financial analysts once used future value and present value factor tables to help with future value and present value calculations, they also used PV annuity factor tables, which contain PV annuity factors for a range of interest rates and annuity lengths. Table A-4 in Appendix A is an example of a PV annuity factor table.

Finding Monthly or Yearly Payments

A very common problem in finance is determining the payment schedule for a loan on a consumer asset, such as a car or a home. Nearly all consumer loans call for equal monthly payments. Suppose, for example, that you have just purchased a $450,000 condominium in Miami’s South Beach district. You were able to put $50,000 down and obtain a 30-year, fixed- rate mortgage at 6.125 percent for the balance. What are your monthly payments?

In this problem we know the present value of the annuity. It is $400,000, the price of the condominium less the down payment ($450,000 − $50,000 = $400,000). We also know the number of payments; since the payments will be made monthly for 30 years, you will make 360 payments (12 months per year × 30 years = 360 months). Because the payments are monthly, both the interest rate and maturity must be expressed in monthly terms. For consumer loans, to get the monthly interest rate, we divide the annual interest rate by 12. Thus, the monthly interest rate equals 0.51042 percent (6.125 percent per year/12 months per year = 0.51042 percent per month). What we need to calculate is the monthly cash payment (CF) over the loan period. The time line looks like the following:


To find CF (remember that CF1 = CF2 = … = CF360 = CF), we use Equation 6.1. We need to make two preliminary calculations:

First, we calculate the present value factor for 360 months at 0.51042 percent per month (or, in decimal form, 0.0051042):
Next, we solve for the PV annuity factor:
We can now plug all the data into Equation 6.1 and solve it for CF:

Your mortgage payments will be $2,430.45 per month.

Solving the problem on a financial calculator takes only a few seconds once the time line is prepared. The most common error students make when using financial calculators is failing to convert all contract variables to be consistent with the compounding period. If the contract calls for monthly payments, the interest rate and contract duration must be stated in monthly terms.

Having converted our data to monthly terms, we enter the following into the calculator: N = 360 months (30 years × 12 months per year = 360 months), i = 0.51042 (6.125 percent per year/12 months per year = 0.51042 percent per month), PV = $400,000, and FV = 0 (to clear the register). Then, pressing the payment button (PMT), we find the answer, which is −$2,430.44. The keystrokes are:


Note that the financial calculator provides the most precise answer but that the hand and financial calculator answers differ by only 1 cent ($2,430.45 − $2,430.44 = $0.01) in this example. The answers are so close because when doing the hand calculation, we carried six to eight decimal places through the entire set of calculations. Had we rounded off each number as the calculations were made, the difference between the answers from the two calculation methods would have been greater. The more numbers that are rounded during the calculations, the greater the possible rounding error.

Learning by Doing Application 6.5 presents another example in which a calculator is used to compute a periodic payment.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 6.5
What Are Your Monthly Car Payments?

Problem

Preparing a Loan Amortization Schedule

Once you understand how to calculate a monthly or yearly loan payment, you have all of the tools that you need to prepare a loan amortization schedule. The term amortization describes the way in which the principal (the amount borrowed) is repaid over the life of a loan. With an amortizing loan, some portion of each loan payment goes to paying down the principal. When the final loan payment is made, the unpaid principal is reduced to zero and the loan is paid off. The other portion of each loan payment is interest, which is payment for the use of outstanding principal (the amount of money still owed). Thus, with an amortizing loan, each loan payment contains some repayment of principal and an interest payment. Nearly all loans to consumers are amortizing loans.

amortizing loan a loan for which each loan payment contains repayment of some principal and a payment of interest that is based on the remaining principal to be repaid

A loan amortization schedule is a table that shows the loan balance at the beginning and end of each period, the payment made during that period, and how much of that payment represents interest and how much represents repayment of principal. To see how an amortization schedule is prepared, consider an example. Suppose that, to purchase a car, you have just borrowed $10,000 at a 5 percent interest rate from a bank. Typically, you would make monthly payments on such a loan. For simplicity, however, we will assume that the bank allows you to make annual payments and that the loan will be repaid over five years. Exhibit 6.4 shows the amortization schedule for this loan.

amortization schedule a table that shows the loan balance at the beginning and end of each period, the payment made during that period, and how much of that payment represents interest and how much represents repayment of principal

To prepare a loan amortization schedule, we must first compute the loan payment. Since, for consumer loans, the amount of the loan payment is fixed, all the payments are identical in amount. Applying Equation 6.1, we calculate the payment as follows:

Alternatively, we enter in a financial calculator the values N = 5 years, i = 5 percent, and PV = $10,000 and then press the PMT key to solve for the loan payment amount. The answer is −$2,309.75 per year. The difference between the two answers results from rounding. For the amortization table calculation, we will use the more precise answer from the financial calculator.

Turning to Exhibit 6.4, we can work through the amortization schedule to see how the table is prepared. For the first year, the values are determined as follows:

The amount borrowed, or the beginning principal balance (P0), is $10,000.
The annual loan payment, as calculated earlier, is $2,309.75.
The interest payment for the first year is $500 and is calculated as follows:
EXHIBIT 6.4 Amortization Table for a Five-Year, $10,000 Loan with an Interest Rate of 5 Percent A loan amortization table shows how regular payments of principal and interest are applied to repay a loan. The exhibit is an amortization table for a five-year, $10,000 loan with an interest rate of 5 percent and annual payments of $2,309.75. Notice that the interest paid declines with each payment, while the principal paid increases.

Year	Beginning Principal Balance(1)	Total Annual Paymenta(2)	Interest Paidb(3)	Principal Paid(2)–(3)(4)	Ending Principal Balance(1)–(4)(5)
1	$10,000.00	$2,309.75	$500.00	$1,809.75	$8,190.25
2	   8,190.25	   2,309.75	   409.51	   1,900.24	   6,290.02

5	   2,199.76	   2,309.75	   109.99	   2,199.76	           0.00
a The total annual payment is calculated using the formula for the present value of an annuity, Equation 6.1. The total annual payment is CF in PVAn − CF × PV annuity factor.
b Interest paid equals the beginning balance times the interest rate.
The principal paid for the year is $1,809.75, calculated as follows:
The ending principal balance is $8,190.25, computed as follows:
Note that the ending principal balance for the first year ($8,190.25) becomes the beginning principal balance for the second year ($8,190.25), which in turn is used in calculating the interest payment for the second year:

This calculation makes sense because each loan payment includes some principal repayment. This is why the interest paid in column 3 declines each year. We repeat the calculations until the loan is fully amortized, at which point the principal balance goes to zero and the loan is paid off.

The following Using Excel Example shows the amortization table calculations in spreadsheet form.

Note, in Exhibit 6.4, the amounts of interest and principal that are paid each year change over time. Interest payments are greatest in the early years of an amortizing loan because much of the principal has not yet been repaid (see columns 1 and 3). However, as the principal balance is reduced over time, the interest payments decline and more of each payment goes toward paying down the principal (see columns 3 and 4).

Using Excel
Loan Amortization Table

Loan amortization tables are most easily constructed using a spreadsheet. Here, we have reconstructed the loan amortization table shown in Exhibit 6.4 using Excel.

Notice that all the values in the amortization table are obtained by using formulas. Once you have built an amortization table like this one, you can change any of the input variables, such as the loan amount or the interest rate, and all of the other numbers will automatically be updated.


If we were preparing an amortization table for monthly payments, all of the principal balances, loan payments, and interest rates would have to be adjusted to a monthly basis. For example, to calculate monthly payments for our auto loan, we would make the following adjustments: n = 60 payments (12 months per year × 5 years = 60 months), i = 0.4167 percent (5 percent per year/12 months per year = 0.4167 percent per month), and monthly payment = $188.71.

Finding the Interest Rate

Another important calculation in finance is determining the interest, or discount, rate for an annuity. The interest rate tells us the rate of return on an annuity contract. For example, suppose your parents are getting ready to retire and decide to convert some of their retirement portfolio, which is invested in the stock market, into an annuity that guarantees them a fixed annual income. Their insurance agent quotes them a price of $350,000 for an annuity that guarantees to pay them $50,000 a year for 10 years. What is the rate of return on the annuity?

We can insert these values into Equation 6.1:

To determine the rate of return for the annuity, we need to solve the equation for the unknown value i. Unfortunately, it is not possible to solve the resulting equation for i algebraically. The only way to solve the problem is by trial and error. We normally solve this kind of problem using a financial calculator or spreadsheet that finds the solution for us. However, it is important to understand how the solution is arrived at by trial and error in order to understand the intuition, so let’s work this problem by hand.

To start the process, we must select an initial value for i, plug it into the right side of the equation, and solve the equation to see if the present value of the annuity cash flows equals $350,000, which is the left side of the equation. If the present value of the annuity is too large (PVA > $350,000), we need to select a higher value for i. If the present value of the annuity cash flows is too small (PVA < $350,000), we need to select a smaller value. We continue the trial-and-error process until we find the value of i for which PVA = $350,000.

The key to getting started is to make the best guess we can as to the possible value of the interest rate given the information and data available to us. We will assume that the current bank savings rate is 4 percent and that the annuity rate of return must exceed the bank rate to entice your parents to purchase the annuity rather than place their money in a bank. We will start our calculations with a 5 percent discount rate. The present value of the annuity is:

That’s a pretty good first guess, but our present value is greater than $350,000, so we need to try a higher discount rate.1 Let’s try 7 percent:

The present value of the annuity is still slightly higher than $350,000, so we still need a larger value of i. How about 7.10 percent:

The value is too small, but we now know that i is between 7.00 and 7.10 percent. On the next try, we need to use a slightly smaller value of i—say, 7.07 percent:

Since this value is slightly too high, we should try a number for i that is only slightly greater than 7.07 percent. We’ll try 7.073 percent:

The cost of the annuity, $350,000, is now exactly the same as the present value of the annuity ($350,000); thus, 7.073 percent is the rate of return earned by the annuity.

It often takes more guesses to solve for the interest rate than it did in this example. Clearly, solving for i by trial and error can be a long and tedious process. Fortunately, as mentioned, these types of problems are easily solved with a financial calculator or spreadsheet. Next, we describe how to compute the interest rate or rate of return on an annuity on a financial calculator.

Calculator Tip: Finding the Interest Rate

To illustrate how to find the interest rate for an annuity on a financial calculator, we will enter the information from the previous example. We know the number of periods (N = 10), the payment amount (PMT = $50,000), and the present value (PV = −$350,000), and we want to solve for the interest rate (i):


As with our calculations above, the interest rate is 7.073 percent. The Using Excel Example below illustrates how a spreadsheet is used to perform this calculation.

Similar types of investment opportunities will pay 5 percent. Is this a good investment opportunity?

Situation

As the owner of a pizza parlor, you are considering whether to buy a fully automated pizza dough preparation machine. Your staff is wildly supportive of the purchase because it would eliminate a tedious part of their work. Your accountant provides you with the following information:

The cost, including shipping, for the pizza dough machine is $25,000.
Cash savings, including labor, raw materials, and tax savings due to depreciation, are $3,500 per year for 10 years.
The present value of the cash savings is $21,506 at a 10 percent discount rate.2
Given the above data, what should you do?



Future Value of an Annuity
Generally, when we are working with annuities, we are interested in computing their present value. On occasion, though, we need to compute the future value of an annuity (FVA). Such computations typically involve some type of saving activity, such as a monthly savings plan. Another application is computing future values for retirement or pension plans with constant contributions.

future value of an annuity (FVA) the value of an annuity at some point in the future

We will start with a simple example. Suppose that you plan to save $1,000 at the end of every year for four years with the goal of buying a racing bicycle. The bike you want is a Colnago C60, a top-of-the-line Italian racing bike that costs around $4,500. If your bank pays 8 percent interest a year, will you have enough money to buy the bike at the end of four years?

To solve this problem, we can first lay out the cash flows on a time line, as we discussed earlier in this chapter. We can then calculate the future value for each cash flow using Equation 5.1, which is FVn = PV × (1 + i)n. Finally, we can add up all the cash flows. The time line and calculations are shown in Exhibit 6.5. Given that the total future value of the four deposits is $4,506.11, as shown in the exhibit, you should have enough money to buy the bike.

Future Value of Annuity Equations

Of course, most business applications involve longer periods of time than the Colnago bike example. One way to solve more complex problems involving the future value of an annuity is first to calculate the present value of the annuity, PVA, using Equation 6.1, and then to use Equation 5.1 to calculate the future value of the PVA. In practice, we can condense this calculation into a single step by using the future value of annuity (FVA) formula, which we obtain by substituting PVA for PV in Equation 5.1.

(6.2)
where:

FVAn	=	future value of an annuity at the end of n periods
PVAn	=	present value of an n period annuity
CF	=	equally spaced and level cash flow
i	=	discount rate, or interest rate
n	=	number of periods
We can rearrange Equation 6.2 to write it in terms of the future value factor and the FV annuity factor:

EXHIBIT 6.5 Future Value of a Four-Year Annuity: Colnago C60 Bicycle The exhibit shows a time line for a savings plan to buy a Colnago C60 bicycle. Under this savings plan, $1,000 is invested at the end of each year for four years at an annual interest rate of 8 percent. We find the value at the end of the four-year period by adding the future values of the separate cash flows, just as in Exhibits 6.1 and 6.2.


As with PV annuity factors, there are tables listing FV annuity factors. Table A-3 in Appendix A, at the back of this book, includes a table that shows the FV annuity factors for various interest rates and annuity lengths (years).

Using Equation 6.2 to compute FVA for the Colnago bike problem is straightforward. The calculation and process are similar to those we developed for PVA problems. That is, we first calculate the FV annuity factor for four years at 8 percent:

We then compute the future value of the annuity by multiplying the constant cash flow (CF) by the FV annuity factor. We plug our computed values into the equation:

This value differs slightly from the one we calculated in Exhibit 6.5 because of rounding.

Calculator Tip: Finding the Future Value of an Annuity

The procedure for calculating the future value of an annuity on a financial calculator is precisely the same as the procedure for calculating the present value of an annuity discussed earlier. The only difference is that we use the FV (future value) key instead of the PV (present value) key. The PV key is entered as a zero to clear the register.

Let’s work the Colnago bicycle problem on a calculator. Recall that we decided to put $1,000 in the bank at the end of each year for four years. The bank pays 8 percent interest. Clear the financial register and make the following entries:


The calculated value of $4,506.11 is the same as in Exhibit 6.5.

Annuities Due
So far we have discussed annuities whose cash flow payments occur at the end of the period, so-called ordinary annuities. Another type of annuity that is fairly common in business is known as an annuity due. Here, cash payments start immediately, at the beginning of the first period. For example, when you rent an apartment, the first rent payment is typically due immediately. The second rent payment is due the first of the second month, and so on. In this kind of payment pattern, you are effectively prepaying for the service.

annuity due an annuity in which payments are made at the beginning of each period

Exhibit 6.6 compares the cash flows for a four-year ordinary annuity and a four-year annuity due. Note that both annuities are made up of four $1,000 cash flows and carry an 8 percent interest rate. Exhibit 6.6A shows an ordinary annuity, in which the cash flows take place at the end of the period, and Exhibit 6.6B shows an annuity due, in which the cash flows take place at the beginning of the period. There are several ways to calculate the present and future values of an annuity due, and we discuss them next.

Present Value Method

One way to compute the present value of an annuity due is to discount each individual cash flow to the present, as shown in Exhibit 6.6B. Note that since the first $1,000 cash flow takes place now, that cash flow is already in present value terms. The present value of the cash flows for the annuity due is $3,577.

Compare this present value with the present value of the cash flows for the ordinary annuity, $3,312, as calculated in Exhibit 6.6A. It should be no surprise that the present value of the annuity due is larger than the present value of the ordinary annuity ($3,577 > $3,312), even though both annuities have four $1,000 cash flows. The reason is that the cash flows of the annuity due are shifted forward one year and, thus, are discounted less.

EXHIBIT 6.6 Ordinary Annuity versus Annuity Due The difference between an ordinary annuity (part A) and an annuity due (part B) is that with an ordinary annuity, the cash flows take place at the end of each period, while with an annuity due, the cash flows take place at the beginning of each period. As you can see in this example, the PV of the annuity due is larger than the PV of the ordinary annuity. The reason is that the cash flows of the annuity due are shifted forward one year and thus are discounted less.


Annuity Transformation Method

An easier way to work annuity due problems is to transform the formula for the present value of an annuity (Equation 6.1) so that it will work for annuity due problems. To do this, we pretend that each cash flow occurs at the end of the period (although it actually occurs at the beginning of the period) and use Equation 6.1. Since Equation 6.1 discounts each cash flow by one period too many, we then correct for the extra discounting by multiplying our answer by (1 + i), where i is the discount rate or interest rate.

The relation between an ordinary annuity and an annuity due can be formally expressed as:

(6.3)
This relation is especially helpful because it works for both present value and future value calculations. Calculating the value of an annuity due using Equation 6.3 involves three steps:

Adjust the problem time line as if the cash flows were an ordinary annuity.
Calculate the present or future value as though the cash flows were an ordinary annuity.
Multiply the answer by (1 + i).
Let’s calculate the value of the annuity due shown in Exhibit 6.6B using Equation 6.3, the transformation technique. First, we restate the time line as if the problem were an ordinary annuity; the revised time line looks like the one in Exhibit 6.6A. Second, we calculate the present value of the annuity as if the problem involved an ordinary annuity. The value of the ordinary annuity is $3,312, as shown in Exhibit 6.6A. Finally, we use Equation 6.3 to make the adjustment to an annuity due:

As they should be, the answers for the two methods of calculation are identical.

Another easy way to calculate the present value or future value of an annuity due is by using the BEG/END switch in your financial calculator. All financial calculators have a key that switches the cash flow from the end of each period to the beginning of each period. The keys are typically labeled “BEG” for cash flows at the beginning of the period and “END” for the cash flows at the end of the period. To calculate the PV of an annuity due: (1) switch the calculator to the BEG mode, (2) enter the data, and (3) press the PV key for the answer. As an example, work the problem from Exhibit 6.6B using your financial calculator.

6.3 Level Cash Flows: Perpetuities
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what a perpetuity is and where we see them in business, and calculate the value of a perpetuity.
A perpetuity is a series of equally spaced and level cash flows that goes on forever. Perpetuities in the form of bonds were used by the British Treasury Department to pay off the debt incurred by the government to finance the Napoleonic wars. These perpetual bonds, called consols, have no maturity date and were traded in the international bond markets until 2015, when the British Treasury redeemed the last of its outstanding consol bonds.

The most important perpetuities in the securities markets today are preferred stock issues. The issuer of preferred stock promises to pay investors a fixed dividend forever unless a retirement date for the preferred stock has been set. Since, as we discussed in Chapter 1, a corporation can have an indefinite life, the expected cash flows from a corporation might also go on forever. When these expected cash flows are constant, they can be viewed as a perpetuity.

From Equation 6.1, we can calculate the present value of a perpetuity by setting n, which is the number of periods, equal to infinity (∞).3 When that is done, the value of the term 1/(1 + i)∞ approaches 0, and thus the present value of a perpetuity that begins next period (PVP) equals:

(6.4)
As you can see, the present value of a perpetuity is the promised constant cash payment (CF) divided by the interest rate (i). A nice feature of the final equation (PVP = CF/i) is that it is algebraically very simple to work with, since it allows us to solve for i directly rather than by trial and error, as is required with Equations 6.1 and 6.2.

To see how we use the perpetuity formula, suppose you had a great experience during your studies at the school of business and decided to endow a scholarship fund for finance students. The goal of the fund is to provide the university with $100,000 of financial support each year forever. If the rate of interest is 8 percent, how much money will you have to give the university to provide the desired level of support? Using Equation 6.4, we find that the present value of the perpetuity is:

Thus, a gift of $1.25 million will provide constant annual funding of $100,000 to the university forever.

Before we finish our discussion of perpetuities, we should point out that the present value of a perpetuity is typically not very different from the present value of a very long annuity. For example, suppose that instead of funding the scholarship forever, you only plan to fund it for 100 years. If you compute the present value of a 100-year annuity of $100,000 using an interest rate of 8 percent, you will find that it equals $1,249,431.76, which is only slightly less than the $1,250,000 value of the perpetuity. Making your gift a perpetuity would only cost you an additional $568.24. This is because the present value of the cash flows to be received after 100 years is extremely small. The key point here is that cash flows that are to be received far in the future can have very small present values.

Learning by Doing Application 6.7 illustrates another application of the present value of a perpetuity formula, Equation 6.4.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 6.7
Preferred Stock Dividends

Problem

Suppose that you are the CEO of a public company and your investment banker recommends that you issue some preferred stock at $50 per share. Similar preferred stock issues are yielding 6 percent. What annual cash dividend does the firm need to offer to be competitive in the marketplace? In other words, what cash dividend paid annually forever would be worth $50 with a 6 percent discount rate?

6.4 Cash Flows That Grow at a Constant Rate
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss growing annuities and perpetuities, as well as their application in business, and calculate their values.
So far, we have been examining level cash flow streams. Often, though, management needs to value a cash flow stream that increases at a constant rate over time. These cash flow streams are called growing annuities or growing perpetuities.

Growing Annuity
Financial managers often need to compute the value of multiyear product or service contracts with cash flows that increase each year at a constant rate. These are called growing annuities. For example, you may want to value the cost of a 25-year lease that adjusts annually for the expected rate of inflation over the life of the contract. Equation 6.5 can be used to compute the present value of an annuity growing at a constant rate for a finite time period:4

(6.5)
where:

PVAn	=	present value of a growing annuity with n periods
CF1	=	cash flow one period in the future (t = 1)
i	=	interest rate, or discount rate
g	=	constant growth rate per period
growing annuity an annuity in which the cash flows increase at a constant rate

You should be aware of several important points when applying Equation 6.5. First, the cash flow (CF1) used is not the cash flow for the current period (CF0); rather, it is the cash flow to be received in the next period (t = 1). The relation between these two cash flows is CF1 = CF0 × (1 + g). Second, a necessary condition for using Equation 6.5 is that i > g. If this condition is not met (i ⩽ g), the calculations from the equation will be meaningless, as you will get a negative or infinite value for finite positive cash flows. A negative value essentially says that someone would have to pay you money to get you to accept a positive cash flow.

As an example of how Equation 6.5 is applied, suppose you work for a company that owns a number of coffee shops in the New York City area. One coffee shop is located in the Empire State Building, and your boss wants to know how much it is worth. The coffee shop has a 50-year lease, so we will assume that it will be in business for 50 years. It produced cash flows of $300,000 after all expenses this year, and the discount rate used by similar businesses is 15 percent. You estimate that, over the long term, cash flows will grow at 2.5 percent per year because of inflation. Thus, you calculate that the coffee shop’s cash flow next year (CF1) will be $307,500, or $300,000 × (1 + 0.025).

Plugging the values from the coffee shop example into Equation 6.5 yields the following result:

The estimated value of the coffee shop is $2,452,128.

Growing Perpetuity
Sometimes cash flows are expected to grow at a constant rate indefinitely. In this case the cash flow stream is called a growing perpetuity. The formula to compute the present value for a growing perpetuity that begins next period (PVP) is as follows:

(6.6)
growing perpetuity a cash flow stream that grows at a constant rate forever

As before, CF1 is the cash flow occurring at the end of the first period, i is the discount or interest rate, and g is the constant rate of growth of the cash flow (CF). Equation 6.6 is an easy equation to work with, and it is used widely in the valuation of common stock for firms that have a policy and history of paying dividends that grow at a constant rate. It is also widely used in the valuation of entire companies, as we will discuss in Chapter 18.

Notice that we can derive Equation 6.6 from Equation 6.5 by setting n equal to ∞. If i is greater than g, as we said it must be, the term [(1 + g)/(1 + i)]∞ is equal to zero, leading to the following result:

This makes sense, of course, since Equation 6.5 describes a growing annuity and Equation 6.6 describes a growing cash flow stream that goes on forever. Notice that both Equations 6.5 and 6.6 are exactly the same as Equations 6.1 and 6.4 when g equals zero.

To illustrate a growing perpetuity, we will consider an example. Suppose that, after graduating from college, you started a health and athletic club. Your concept included not only providing workout facilities, such as weights, treadmills, and elliptical trainers, but also promoting a healthy lifestyle through a focus on cooking and nutrition. The concept has proved popular, and after only five years, you have seven clubs in operation. Your accountant reports that the firm’s cash flow last year was $450,000, and the appropriate discount rate for the club is 18 percent. You expect the firm’s cash flows to increase by 5 percent per year, which includes 2 percent for expected inflation. Since the business is a corporation, you can assume it will continue operating indefinitely into the future. What is the value of the firm?

We can use Equation 6.6 to solve this problem. Although the equation is very easy to use, a common mistake is using the current period’s cash flow (CF0) and not the next period’s cash flow (CF1). Since the cash flow is growing at a constant growth rate, g, we simply multiply CF0 by (1 + g) to get the value of CF1. Thus,

We can then substitute the result into Equation 6.6, which yields a helpful variant of this equation:

Now we can insert the values for the health club into the equation and solve for PVP:

The business is worth $3,634,615.

The growing annuity and perpetuity formulas are useful, and we will apply them later on in this book. Unfortunately, even though advanced financial calculators have special programs for annuities and perpetuities with constant cash flows, typical financial calculators do not include programs for growing annuities and perpetuities.

6.5 The Effective Annual Interest Rate
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss why the effective annual interest rate (EAR) is the appropriate way to annualize interest rates, and calculate the EAR.
So far in this chapter and the preceding one, there has been little question about which interest rate to use in a particular computation. In most cases, a single interest rate has been supplied. When working with real market data, however, the situation is not so clear-cut. We often encounter interest rates that can be computed in different ways. In this final section, we try to untangle some of the issues that can cause problems.

Why the Confusion?
To better understand why interest rates can be so confusing, consider the following situation. Suppose you borrow $100 on your bank credit card and plan to keep the balance outstanding for one year. The credit card’s stated interest rate is 1 percent per month. The federal Truth-in-Lending Act, which we discuss in more detail later in this section, requires the bank and other financial institutions to disclose to consumers the annual percentage rate (APR) charged on a loan. The APR is the annualized interest rate using simple interest. It ignores the interest earned on interest associated with compounding periods of less than one year. Thus, the APR is defined as the simple interest charged per period multiplied by the number of periods per year. For the bank credit card loan, the APR is 12 percent (1 percent per month × 12 months = 12 percent).

annual percentage rate (APR) the simple interest rate charged per period multiplied by the number of periods per year

At the end of the year, you go to pay off the credit card balance as planned. It seems reasonable to assume that with an APR of 12 percent your credit card balance at the end of one year would be $112 (1.12 × $100 = $112). Wrong! The bank’s actual interest rate is 1 percent per month, meaning that the bank will compound your credit card balance monthly, 12 times over the year. The bank’s calculation for the balance due is $112.68 [$100 × (1.01)12 = $112.68].5 The bank is actually charging you 12.68 percent per year, and the total interest paid for the one-year loan is $12.68 rather than $12.00. This example raises a question: What is the correct way to annualize an interest rate?

Calculating the Effective Annual Interest Rate
In making financial decisions, the correct way to annualize an interest rate is to compute the effective annual interest rate. The effective annual interest rate (EAR) is defined as the annual interest rate that takes compounding over the course of a year into account. Mathematically, the EAR can be stated as follows:

(6.7)
effective annual interest rate (EAR) the annual interest rate that reflects compounding within a year

where m is the number of compounding periods during a year. The quoted interest rate is by definition a simple annual interest rate, like the APR. That means that the quoted interest rate has been annualized by multiplying the rate per period by the number of periods per year. The EAR conversion formula accounts for the number of compounding periods and, thus, effectively adjusts the annualized quoted interest rate for the time value of money. Because the EAR is the true cost of borrowing and lending, it is the rate that should be used for making all finance decisions.

quoted interest rate a simple annual interest rate, such as the APR

We will use our bank credit card example to illustrate the use of Equation 6.7. Recall that the credit card has an APR of 12 percent (1 percent per month). The APR is the quoted interest rate, and the number of compounding periods (m) is 12. Applying Equation 6.7, we find that the effective annual interest rate is:

The EAR value of 12.68 percent is the true cost of borrowing the $100 on the bank credit card for one year. The EAR calculation adjusts for the effects of compounding and, hence, the time value of money.

Finally, notice that interest rates are quoted in the marketplace in three ways:

The quoted interest rate. This is an interest rate that has been annualized by multiplying the rate per period by the number of compounding periods. The APR is an example. All consumer borrowing and lending rates are annualized in this manner.
The interest rate per period. The bank credit card rate of 1 percent per month is an example of this kind of rate. You can find the interest rate per period by dividing the quoted interest rate by the number of compounding periods.
The effective annual interest rate (EAR). This is the interest rate actually paid (or earned) after accounting for compounding. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish a quoted rate from an EAR. Generally, however, an annualized consumer rate is an APR rather than an EAR.
Comparing Interest Rates
When borrowing or lending money, it is sometimes necessary to compare and select among interest rate alternatives. Quoted interest rates are comparable when they cover the same overall time period, such as one year, and have the same number of compounding periods. If quoted interest rates are not comparable, we must adjust them to a common time period. The easiest way, and the correct way, to make interest rates comparable for making finance decisions is to convert them to effective annual interest rates. Consider an example.

Suppose you are the chief financial officer of a manufacturing company. The company is planning a $1 billion plant expansion and will finance it by borrowing money for five years. Three financial institutions have submitted interest rate quotes; all are APRs:

Lender A: 10.40 percent compound monthly
Lender B: 10.90 percent compounded annually
Lender C: 10.50 percent compounded quarterly
Although all the loans have the same maturity, they are not comparable because the APRs have different compounding periods. To make the adjustments for the different time periods, we apply Equation 6.7 to convert each of the APR quotes into an EAR:

As shown, Lender B offers the lowest interest cost at 10.90 percent.

Notice the shift in rankings that takes place as a result of the EAR calculations. When we initially looked at the APR quotes, it appeared that Lender A offered the lowest rate and Lender B had the highest. After computing the EAR, we find that when we account for the effect of compounding, Lender B actually offers the lowest interest rate.

Another important point is that if all the interest rates are quoted as APRs with the same annualizing period, such as monthly, the interest rates are comparable and you can select the correct rate by simply comparing the quotes. That is, the lowest APR corresponds with the lowest cost of funds. Thus, it is correct for borrowers or lenders to make economic decisions with APR data as long as interest rates have the same maturity and the same compounding period. To find the true cost of the loan, however, it is still necessary to compute the EAR.

Learning by Doing Application 6.8 illustrates another effective annual interest rate calculation.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 6.8
What Is the True Cost of a Loan?

Problem

During a period of economic expansion, Frank Smith became financially overextended and was forced to consolidate his debt with a loan from a consumer finance company. The consolidated debt provided Frank with a single loan and lower monthly payments than he had previously been making. The loan agreement quotes an APR of 20 percent, and Frank must make monthly payments. What is the true cost of the loan?





Consumer Protection Acts and Interest Rate Disclosure
In 1968 Congress passed the Truth-in-Lending Act to ensure that all borrowers receive meaningful information about the cost of credit so that they can make intelligent economic decisions.6 The act applies to all lenders that extend credit to consumers, and it covers credit card loans, auto loans, home mortgage loans, home equity loans, home improvement loans, and some small-business loans. Similar legislation, the so-called Truth-in-Savings Act, applies to consumer savings vehicles such as certificates of deposit (CDs). These two pieces of legislation require by law that the APR be disclosed on all consumer loans and savings plans and that it be prominently displayed in advertising and contractual documents.

Truth-in-Lending Act a federal law requiring lenders to fully inform borrowers of important information related to loans, including the annual percentage rate charged

Truth-in-Savings Act a federal law requiring institutions offering consumer savings vehicles, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), to fully inform consumers of important information about the savings vehicles, including the annual percentage rate paid

We know that the EAR, not the APR, represents the true economic interest rate. So why did the Truth-in-Lending and Truth-in-Savings Acts specify that the APR must be the disclosed rate? The APR was selected because it’s easy to calculate and easy to understand. When the legislation was passed, personal computers and handheld calculators did not exist. Down at the auto showroom, salespeople needed an easy way to explain and annualize the monthly interest charge, and the APR provided just such a method. And most important, if all the auto lenders quoted monthly APR, consumers could use this rate to select the loan with the lowest interest cost.

Today, although lenders and borrowers are legally required to quote the APR, they run their businesses using interest rate calculations based on the present value and future value formulas. Consumers are bombarded with both APR and EAR rates, and confusion reigns. At the car dealership, for example, you may find that your auto loan’s APR is 5 percent but the actual borrowing rate is 5.12 percent. And at the bank where your grandmother gets free coffee and doughnuts, she may be told that the bank’s one-year CD has an APR of 3 percent, but it really pays 3.04 percent. Because of confusion arising from conflicting interest rates in the marketplace, some observers believe that the APR calculation has outlived its usefulness and should be replaced by the EAR.

In addition to requiring that lenders report the APR on all consumer loans, the Truth-in-Lending Act provides other important protections for consumers. For example, it also limits the liability of credit card holders if a credit card is stolen or used without the cardholder’s approval. Since this act was passed in 1968, a number of subsequent acts have added to the protections of the Truth-in-Lending Act. The most recent of these, which you may be familiar with, is the Credit Card Act of 2009. This act was passed in response to criticisms of actions by credit card companies leading up to the financial crisis of 2008. Among other things, it places new limits on the ability of credit card companies to raise interest rates, limits the fees that they can charge, requires better disclosure of rate increases and how long it will take a cardholder to pay off the outstanding balance with minimum monthly payments, and makes it more difficult for credit card companies to issue new cards to people under age 21.

The Appropriate Interest Rate Factor
Here is a final question to consider: What is the appropriate interest rate to use when making future or present value calculations? The answer is simple: use the EAR. Under no circumstance should the APR or any other quoted rate be used as the interest rate in present or future value calculations. Consider an example of using the EAR in such a calculation.

Petra, a student at University of Texas, has purchased from a small consumer finance company a $100 savings note with a two-year maturity. The contract states that the note has a 20 percent APR and pays interest quarterly. The quarterly interest rate is thus 5 percent (20 percent/4 quarters = 5 percent per quarter). Petra has several questions about the note: (1) What is the note’s effective annual interest rate (EAR)? (2) How much money will she have at the end of two years? (3) When making the future value calculation, should she use the quarterly interest rate or the EAR?

To answer Petra’s questions, we first compute the EAR, which is the actual interest earned on the note:

Next, we calculate the future value of the note using the EAR. Because the EAR is an annual rate, for this problem we use a total of two compounding periods. The calculation is as follows:

We can also calculate the future value using the quarterly rate of interest of 5 percent with a total of eight compounding periods. In this case, the calculation is as follows:

The two calculation methods yield the same answer: $147.75.

In summary, any time you do a future value or present value calculation, you must use either the interest rate per period (quoted rate/m) or the EAR as the interest rate factor. It does not matter which of these you use. Both will properly account for the impact of compounding on the value of cash flows. Interest rate proxies such as the APR should never be used as interest rate factors for calculating future or present values, because they do not properly account for the number of compounding periods.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Explain why cash flows occurring at different times must be adjusted to reflect their value as of a common date before they can be compared, and compute the present value and the future value for multiple cash flows.

When making decisions involving cash flows over time, we should first identify the magnitude and timing of the cash flows and then adjust each individual cash flow to reflect its value as of a common date. For example, the process of discounting (compounding) cash flows adjusts them for the time value of money because today’s dollars are not equal in value to dollars in the future. Once all of the cash flows are in present (future) value terms, they can be compared to make decisions. Section 6.1 discusses the computation of present values and future values of multiple cash flows.

2 Explain the difference between an ordinary annuity and an annuity due, and calculate the present value and the future value of an ordinary annuity and an annuity due.

An ordinary annuity is a finite series of equally spaced, level cash flows over time. The cash flows for an ordinary annuity are assumed to take place at the end of each period. To find the present value of an ordinary annuity, we multiply the present value of an annuity factor, which is equal to (1 − present value factor)/i, by the amount of the constant cash flow. We multiply the present value of an ordinary annuity by (1 + i)n to calculate its future value in n periods.

An annuity due is an annuity in which the cash flows occur at the beginning of each period. A lease is an example of an annuity due. In this case, we are effectively prepaying for the service. To calculate the value of an annuity due, we calculate the present value (or future value) as though the cash flows are from an ordinary annuity. We then multiply the ordinary annuity value times (1 + i). Section 6.2 discusses the calculation of the present value and future value of an ordinary annuity and an annuity due.

3 Explain what a perpetuity is and where we see them in business, and calculate the value of a perpetuity.

A perpetuity is like an annuity except that the cash flows are perpetual—they never end. British Treasury Department bonds, called consols, were the first widely used securities of this kind. The most common example of a perpetuity today is preferred stock. The issuer of preferred stock promises to pay fixed-rate dividends forever. The cash flows from corporations can also look like perpetuities. To calculate the present value of a perpetuity, we simply divide the constant cash flow (CF) by the interest rate (i).

4 Discuss growing annuities and perpetuities, as well as their application in business, and calculate their values.

Financial managers often need to value cash flow streams that increase at a constant rate over time. These cash flow streams are called growing annuities or growing perpetuities. An example of a growing annuity is a 10-year lease with an annual adjustment for the expected rate of inflation over the life of the contract. If the cash flows continue to grow at a constant rate indefinitely, this cash flow stream is called a growing perpetuity. Since a C-corporation has an indefinite life, when the cash flows from such a corporation are growing at a constant rate, they can be thought of as a growing perpetuity. The calculation of the value of a cash flow stream that grows at a constant rate is discussed in Section 6.4.

5 Discuss why the effective annual interest rate (EAR) is the appropriate way to annualize interest rates, and calculate the EAR.

The EAR is the annual interest rate that takes compounding into account. Thus, the EAR is the true cost of borrowing or lending money. When we need to compare interest rates, we must make sure that the rates to be compared have the same time and compounding periods. If interest rates are not comparable, they must be converted into common terms. The easiest way to convert rates to common terms is to calculate the EAR for each interest rate. The use and calculation of EAR are discussed in Section 6.5.

Appendix: Deriving the Formula for the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity
In this chapter we showed that the formula for a perpetuity can be obtained from the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity if n is set equal to ∞. It is also possible to go the other way. In other words, the present value of an ordinary annuity formula can be derived from the formula for a perpetuity. In fact, this is how the annuity formula was originally obtained. To see how this was done, assume that someone has offered to pay you $1 per year forever, beginning next year, but that, in return, you will have to pay that person $1 per year forever, beginning in year n + 1.

The cash flows you will receive and the cash flows you will pay are represented in the following time line:


The first row of dollar values shows the cash flows for the perpetuity that you will receive. This perpetuity is worth:

The second row shows the cash flows for the perpetuity that you will pay. The present value of what you owe is the value of a $1 perpetuity that is discounted for n years.

Notice that if you subtract, year by year, the cash flows you would pay from the cash flows you would receive, you get the cash flows for an n-year annuity.


Therefore, the value of the offer equals the value of an n-year annuity. Solving for the difference between PVPReceive and PVPPay we see that this is the same as Equation 6.1.

In fact, this is how Equation 6.5 was actually derived. Show how Equation 6.5 can be derived from Equation 6.6.

Ethics Case
America’s Ailing Drug Prices
In September 2016, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch appeared before the U.S. House Oversight Committee to address the controversial issue of rising prescription drug prices. Mylan was in the spotlight because of a dramatic 600 percent increase in the price of the EpiPen, a steroidal injector that treats severe and sometimes deadly allergic reactions. The rise in the cost of EpiPens was stunning. Priced at $100 for a two-pack in 2009, the same medication sold for over $600 by the fall of 2016. Members of the House of Representatives expressed their outrage over the surge in pricing for this important drug. Representative Elijah Cummings, from Maryland, accused the pharmaceutical maker of raising EpiPen prices “to get filthy rich at the expense of our constituents.” Mylan CEO Bresch countered this criticism by claiming that the price increases were necessary to ensure that Mylan could continue to invest in the research and development (R&D) necessary for new drug discovery, as well as improvements to existing products including the EpiPen.


The price increase for the EpiPen is hardly unusual in the U.S. drug market. Most drug makers added significant markups to the retail prices of their compounds over the same time period. For example, AbbVie Inc. raised the price of the arthritis drug Humira more than 126 percent from 2011 to 2015, while Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. increased the price for its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone by 118 percent over the same period. Data from National Health Statistics Group, summarized in the accompanying figure, illustrate that overall U.S. retail expenditures on prescription drugs grew steadily over the last two decades. By 2018, total U.S. expenditures topped $335 billion!1

Boosting the Bottom Line at Patients’ Expense?

To be sure, price increases are an important way for drug company executives to increase profits and benefit their stockholders. Like most manufacturers, pharma giant Pfizer Inc. routinely raises prices for a large proportion of its offerings, including more than 40 of its products in 2019. Similarly, Merck & Co. raised its list prices by an average of about 5.0 percent in 2019. In some cases, increases for just a single prescription can give a major boost to a company’s bottom line. For example, Pfizer increased the price of its popular painkiller Lyrica by 51.7 percent over a three-year period. Analyst projections suggested that Lyrica would generate close to $5 billion in annual sales for Pfizer through 2019.2

While the increasing cost of medications certainly hit patients’ pocketbooks, the consequences can be dire when sharp price increases impact lifesaving drugs. In one high-profile 2015 case, Turing Pharmaceuticals, headed by then CEO Martin Shkreli, acquired the drug Daraprim, a 62-year-old medicine used to treat a parasitic infection that can cause brain damage and death in infants and people with AIDS. Following the acquisition, Turing raised the price of Daraprim overnight from $13.50 to $750 a pill—a 5,000 percent increase! When asked by investors about the impact of the decision on the company’s profits, Shkreli cynically wrote, “I think it will be huge…. So 5,000 paying bottles at the new price is $375,000,000—almost all of it is profit, and I think we will get three years of that or more. Should be a very handsome investment for all of us.” While not illegal, the price increase prompted public outrage and Shkreli was subpoenaed to appear before the U.S. House Oversight Committee to answer questions about the move. While Shkreli resigned as the CEO of Turing later in the year, the company continues to resist numerous calls to reduce the cost of the medication.

While the price increases associated with Daraprim are extreme, there is little doubt that the widespread increase in prescription drug prices is making health care increasingly unaffordable in the United States. Indeed, some health care advocates are now arguing that price increases actually translate into poorer health outcomes and dangerous medical conditions because some patients can no longer afford to take drugs at their prescribed dosage.3

The High Cost of Drug Development

Bringing a new drug to market typically involves many years of very costly research, development, and testing by the pharmaceutical maker. Once a new drug is discovered and developed for human use, its safety and efficacy are evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As part of its evaluation, the FDA assesses the outcomes of three stages of clinical trials involving clinical researchers, doctors, and thousands of patients over several years. This process of discovery and testing can be very expensive, with researchers estimating that the average R&D cost of developing a new FDA-approved medication was $2.6 billion (in 2013 dollars) over the last decade.4 Given these costs, it is little wonder that most pharmaceutical companies make enormous investments in R&D every year. Pfizer, for example, expensed over $8.6 billion in R&D in 2019 alone!

Drug development and testing are also exceedingly time consuming and risky. On average, it takes a successful experimental drug 15 years to go from lab to patient.5 Unfortunately, the vast majority of drugs that are developed actually fail to ever receive FDA approval for use. In a recent industry study of clinical trials between 2006 and 2015, only 9.6 percent of all developmental drugs successfully made it through even the first stage of clinical trials. Of those that succeeded in the first phase, only 30.7 percent ended up making it through the second set of clinical trials.6


Given this very high development expense, the FDA grants a period of market exclusivity lasting from 5 to 12 years when a new patented drug is approved for patient use. During the exclusivity period, no competing low-cost or generic version of the drug can be sold in the U.S. market. While exclusivity gives the company a veritable monopoly on the marketing and pricing of the drug, executives and regulators agree that it provides pharmaceutical companies with a critical economic incentive to develop new drugs. This incentive is important for the stockholders of drug companies because they have to finance R&D expenses and they bear the costs associated with the duration and risk of drug development.

Innovation or Gaming the System

While market exclusivity provides pharmaceutical companies with an important economic incentive to develop new drugs and improve existing medications, many of these same companies attempt to game the exclusivity rules through maneuvers commonly known as “hard switching” and “evergreening.”

Hard switching happens when a manufacturer discontinues the sale of a drug immediately before the end of its exclusivity period and replaces the drug with a new, market-exclusive compound. In many cases, patients are prescribed the new medication before the lower-cost generic medication hits the market. If patients are unaware and never informed of the availability of generic versions of the older drug, they will continue to use the more expensive brand-name medication.

Evergreening occurs when a pharmaceutical company makes small changes to a drug before the end of its exclusivity period in an effort to gain a new patent and a new exclusivity period. Typically these changes involve modifications to a medication’s dosage or form of release. Drug makers claim that the alterations improve the efficacy of the medication and typically promote the new higher-priced product as superior to the older version. Critics of evergreening, however, argue that the majority of these changes are trivial and yield only minor benefits for patients, while allowing pharmaceutical makers to continue to charge exorbitant prices for equivalent drugs.

Can Consumers Fight Back Against High Drug Prices?

Like any product, drug prices are determined by supply and demand. While consumers may have a number of alternative options when they purchase a car or a gallon of milk in the grocery store, patients typically face far fewer options when they purchase medications as individuals or through one of many forms of medical insurance.

There are often many drugs to choose from when treating common conditions. For example, a “statin” lowers cholesterol in the body and is one of the most commonly prescribed medicines in the United States today. Given the high demand for the product, many pharmaceutical companies have developed their own branded statin, including Pfizer (Lipitor), Astra Zeneca (Crestor), and Merck (Zocor), and various very low-cost generic versions of these drugs are available on the market today.

On the other end of the spectrum, exclusivity rules and a lack of viable alternative medications can severely limit a patient’s options. In the most extreme cases, patients with rare conditions must rely on pharmaceutical companies to develop so-called “orphan” drugs. Under the 1983 Orphan Drug Act (ODA), drug companies producing orphan treatments expected to be used by 200,000 patients or less can qualify for additional exclusivity, special tax treatment, and R&D grants to incentivize research for these relatively small populations. Once a treatment is developed, however, the lack of competition can leave patients vulnerable to price increases. For example, in 2015 Valeant Pharmaceuticals raised the price of Cuprimine, a drug to treat an extremely rare malady known as Wilson’s disease, by 400 percent to $26,189 for the annual treatment.

To many, it seems that consumers are at a distinct disadvantage in the prescription drug market. In contrast, in many other countries, drug prices are negotiated by government health programs that have effectively curbed the increases observed in the U.S. market. Since the government programs are the only large buyers, they can drive hard bargains with manufacturers, and the savings for consumers can be huge. For example, a report by CNN noted that the monthly prescription price for the common acid reflux drug Nexium costs $215 in the United States but just $23 in the Netherlands.7 These low prices have driven many U.S. consumers to try to fill their prescriptions outside of the United States, typically in Canada and Mexico, although U.S. law prohibits pharmacies and people with prescriptions from filling their orders over the border.

For the majority of Americans, drug prices are negotiated indirectly through their insurers, which have a limited ability to constrain surging prices. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are the largest insurers of patients in the United States, covering more than 125 million people. Federal law, however, prohibits the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid from negotiating drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies.

Private insurers have some options available to reduce excessive drug pricing. One tool at their disposal is the requirement that a patient receive prior authorization from the insurer before receiving coverage for a given prescription. While prior authorization can cause some drug makers to think twice about exorbitant charges, the practice is under fire by state attorneys general who contend that the threat of nonauthorization for expensive drugs is inconsistent with an insurer’s obligation to cover the medical needs of the insured.

Insurers also rely on drug formularies and tiered co-payments by patients for medications to moderate pharmaceutical costs. Drug formularies are the lists of drugs that a health insurer agrees to pay for, at least partially, for a given medical condition. In setting the formulary, health experts try to provide access to effective but low-cost drugs. In many cases, this means providing access to generic rather than brand-name drugs for the same indication. Higher patient co-payments reduce drug affordability for consumers, reducing the demand for certain drugs. The effect of co-payments on demand, however, is limited by state laws that cap out-of-pocket expenses that must be paid by the insured.

Discussion Questions
Is it ethical for pharmaceutical companies to charge high prices for certain drugs—even if the drugs are required to sustain lives?
What would be the potential benefits and consequences of allowing the Medicare and Medicaid programs to directly negotiate drug prices?
Many have called for the FDA to lower its review standard for the approval of prescription drugs and speed up the clinical trial process. How do you think these changes would affect the stock prices of pharmaceutical companies? How do you think these changes would affect patients?

1 Notice that we have rounded the PV annuity factor to three decimal places (7.722). If we use a financial calculator and do not round, we get a more precise answer of $386,086.75.
2 The annuity present value factor for 10 years at 10 percent is 6.1446. Thus, PVA10 = CF × Annuity factor = $3,500 × 6.1446 = $21,506.10. Using a financial calculator, PVA10 = $21,505.98. The difference is due to rounding errors.
3 Conversely, we can derive the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity, Equation 6.1, from the formula for a perpetuity, as explained in the appendix at the end of this chapter.
4 In Equation 6.5 we represent the present value of a growing annuity of n periods using the same notation (PVAn) that we use for a regular annuity in Equation 6.1. We do this because the regular annuity is just a special case of the growing annuity, where g = 0. Equation 6.5 is the more general form of the annuity formula.
5 If you have any doubt about the total credit card debt at the end of one year, make the calculation 12 times on your calculator: the first month is $100 × 1.01 = 101.00; the second month is $101.00 × 1.01 = $102.01; the third month is $102.01 × 1.01 = $103.03; and so on for 12 months.

The Kohls department store chain was facing headwinds coming into 2020. At approximately $20 billion, the firm’s revenues had changed little since 2019. However, operating income excluding unusual items had declined by almost 20% over the same period. Kohls performance was similar to that of other U.S. retailers facing falling mall traffic, import tariffs, and increasing transportation costs. In addition, Kohls’ business was increasingly being squeezed between the growing segments of e-commerce retailers and off-price stores like TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack. Kohls’ stock price reflected the company’s perilous position, declining precipitously from its all-time high of $79.11 per share on August 1, 2018 to $21.36 just two years later.

The challenges faced by Kohls did not affect every firm in its industry equally. For example, Target’s sales and operating income grew steadily over the same period, thanks in part to its focus on growing its e-commerce sales channel, the diversification of its product offerings to include traditional grocery, and the creation of a range of highly profitable private label brands. The success of Target’s business model paid off for its shareholders, who saw the value of their shares nearly double from $87.50 per share on August 1, 2018 to $151.21 two years later.

This chapter discusses risk, return, and the relation between them. The difference in returns earned by Kohls and Target from August 2018 to August 2020 illustrates a challenge faced by all investors. The shares of both companies were risky investments in 2018, and yet someone who invested in Kohls stock lost 72.9 percent [($21.36 − $79.11)/$79.11 = − 0.729, or −72.9 percent] of their investment over the next two years. An investor in Target, however, earned a positive return of 72.8 percent [($151.21 − $87.50)/$87.50 = 0.728 or 72.8 percent] during the same period. How should investors have viewed the risks of investing in the shares of these companies in 2018, and how is this risk related to the returns that the investors could expect to earn? In addition, how should an investor think about risk and return if these stocks are included in a portfolio of other risky investments? These questions are the focus of this chapter.

Chapter Preview
Up to this point, we have mentioned the rate of return that we use to discount cash flows, but we have not explained how that rate is determined. We have now reached the point where it is time to examine key concepts underlying the discount rate. This chapter introduces a quantitative framework for measuring risk and return. This framework will help you develop an intuitive understanding of how risk and return are related and what risks matter to investors. The relation between risk and return has implications for the rate we use to discount cash flows because the time value of money concepts that we discussed in Chapters 5 and 6 are directly related to the returns that investors require. We must understand these concepts in order to determine the correct present value for a series of cash flows and to be able to make investment decisions that create value for stockholders.

We begin this chapter with a discussion of the general relation between risk and return to introduce the idea that investors require a higher rate of return from riskier assets. This is one of the most fundamental relations in finance. We next develop the statistical concepts required to quantify holding period returns, expected returns, and risk. We then apply these concepts to portfolios with a single asset and with more than one asset to illustrate the benefit of diversification. From this discussion, you will see how investing in more than one asset enables an investor to reduce the total risk associated with his or her investment portfolio, and you will learn how to quantify this benefit.

Once we have discussed the concept of diversification, we examine what it means for the relation between risk and return. We find that the total risk associated with an investment consists of two components: (1) unsystematic risk and (2) systematic risk. Diversification enables investors to eliminate the unsystematic risk associated with an individual asset. Investors do not require higher returns for the unsystematic risk that they can eliminate through diversification. Only systematic risk—risk that cannot be diversified away—affects expected returns on an investment. The distinction between unsystematic and systematic risk and the recognition that unsystematic risk can be diversified away are extremely important in finance. After reading this chapter, you will understand precisely what the term risk means in finance and how it is related to the rates of return that investors require.

7.1 Risk and Return
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the relation between risk and return.
The rate of return that investors require for an investment depends on the risk associated with that investment. The greater the risk, the larger the return investors require as compensation for bearing that risk. This is one of the most fundamental relations in finance. The rate of return is what you earn on an investment, stated in percentage terms. We will be more specific later, but for now you might think of risk as a measure of how certain you are that you will receive a particular return. Higher risk means you are less certain.

To get a better understanding of how risk and return are related, consider an example. You are trying to select the best investment from among the following three stocks:

Stock	Expected Return (%)	Risk Level (%)
A	12	12
B	12	16
C	16	16
Which would you choose? If you were comparing only Stocks A and B, you should choose Stock A. Both stocks have the same expected return, but Stock A has less risk. It does not make sense to invest in the riskier stock if the expected return is the same. Similarly, you can see that Stock C is clearly superior to Stock B. Stocks B and C have the same level of risk, but Stock C has a higher expected return. It would not make sense to accept a lower return for taking on the same level of risk.

Building Intuition
More Risk Means a Higher Expected Return

The greater the risk associated with an investment, the greater the return investors expect from it. A corollary to this idea is that investors want the highest return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of return. When choosing between two investments that have the same level of risk, investors prefer the investment with the higher return. Alternatively, if two investments have the same expected return, investors prefer the less risky alternative.

But what about the choice between Stocks A and C? This choice is less obvious. Making it requires understanding the concepts that we discuss in the rest of this chapter.

7.2 Holding Period Returns
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the two components of a total holding period return, and calculate this return for an asset.
Before we begin a detailed discussion of the relation between risk and return, we should define more precisely what these terms mean. We begin with the measure of holding period return. When people refer to the return from an investment, they are generally referring to the total return over some investment period, or holding period. The total holding period return consists of two components: (1) capital appreciation and (2) income. The capital appreciation component of a return, RCA, arises from a change in the price of the asset over the investment or holding period and is calculated as follows:

where P0 is the price paid for the asset at time zero and P1 is the price at a later point in time.

total holding period return the total return on an asset over a specific period of time or holding period

The income component of a return arises from income that an investor receives from the asset while he or she owns it. For example, when a firm pays a cash dividend on its stock, the income component of the return on that stock, RI, is calculated as follows:

where CF1 is the cash flow from the dividend.

The total holding period return, RT, is simply the sum of the capital appreciation and income components of return:

(7.1)
Let’s consider an example of calculating the total holding period return on an investment. One year ago today, you purchased a share of Twitter, Inc., stock for $32.05. Today it is worth $44.00. What total return did you earn on this stock over the past year if Twitter paid no dividend?

Since Twitter paid no dividend, and assuming you received no other income from holding the stock, the total return for the year equals the return from the capital appreciation. The total return is calculated as follows:

What return would you have earned if Twitter had paid a $1 dividend and today’s price was $43.00? With the $1 dividend and a correspondingly lower price, the total return is the same:

You can see from this example that a dollar of capital appreciation is worth the same as a dollar of income.

Learning by Doing Application 7.1 illustrates another holding period return calculation.

Calculating the Return on an Investment

Problem

You purchased a beat-up 1974 Datsun 240Z sports car a year ago for $1,500. Datsun is what Nissan, the Japanese car company, was called in the 1970s. The 240Z was the first in a series of cars that led to the Nissan 370Z that is being sold today. Recognizing that a mint-condition 240Z is a much sought-after car, you invested $7,000 and a lot of your time in fixing up the car. Last week, you sold it to a collector for $18,000. Not counting the value of the time you spent restoring the car, what is the total return you earned on this investment over the one-year holding period?





Before You Go On
What are the two components of a total holding period return?
7.3 Expected Returns
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what an expected return is, and calculate the expected return for an asset.
An expected return is a reflection of the possible returns from an investment, weighted by the probability of each possible return. Expected returns reflect investors’ expectations about future outcomes. To better understand this concept, let’s suppose that you are a senior who plays college baseball and that your team is in the College World Series. Furthermore, suppose that you have been drafted by the Washington Nationals and are coming up for your last at-bat as a college player. The fact that this is your last at-bat is important because you just signed a very unusual contract with the Nationals. Your signing bonus will be determined solely by whether you get a hit in your final collegiate at-bat. If you get a hit, then your signing bonus will be $800,000. Otherwise, it will be $400,000. This past season, you got a hit 32.5 percent of the times you were at bat (you did not get a hit 67.5 percent of the time), and you believe this percentage reflects the likelihood that you will get a hit in your last collegiate at-bat.1

What is the expected value of your bonus? If you have taken a statistics course, you might recall that an expected value represents the sum of the products of the possible outcomes and the probabilities that those outcomes will be realized. In our example, the expected value of the bonus can be calculated using the following formula:

where E(Bonus) is your expected signing bonus, pH is the probability of a hit, pNH is the probability of no hit, BH is the bonus you receive if you get a hit, and BNH is the bonus you receive if you get no hit. Since pH equals 0.325, pNH equals 0.675, BH equals $800,000, and BNH equals $400,000, the expected value of your bonus is:

Notice that the expected bonus of $530,000 is not equal to either of the two possible payoffs. Neither is it equal to the simple average of the two possible payoffs. This is because the expected bonus takes into account the probability of each event occurring. If the probability of each event had been 50 percent, then the expected bonus would be equal to the simple average of the two payoffs:

However, since it is more likely that you will not get a hit (a 67.5 percent chance) than that you will get a hit (a 32.5 percent chance), and the payoff is lower if you do not get a hit, the expected bonus is less than the simple average.

What would your expected payoff be if you got a hit 99 percent of the time? We intuitively know that the expected bonus should be much closer to $800,000 in this case. In fact, it is:

The key point here is that the expected value reflects the relative likelihoods of the possible outcomes.

We calculate an expected return in finance in the same way that we calculate any expected value. The expected return is a weighted average of the possible returns from an investment, where each of these returns is weighted by the probability that it will occur. In general terms, the expected return on an asset, E(RAsset), is calculated as follows:

(7.2)
expected return an average of the possible returns from an investment, where each return is weighted by the probability that it will occur

where Ri is possible return i and pi is the probability that you will actually earn Ri. The summation symbol in this equation

is mathematical shorthand indicating that n values are added together. In Equation 7.2, each of the n possible returns is multiplied by the probability that it will be realized, and these products are then added together to calculate the expected return.

It is important to make sure that the sum of the n individual probabilities, the pi s, always equals 1, or 100 percent, when you calculate an expected value. The sum of the probabilities cannot be less than 100 percent because you must account for all possible outcomes in the calculation. On the other hand, as you may recall from statistics, the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes cannot exceed 100 percent. For example, notice that the sum of the pi s equals 1 in each of the expected bonus calculations that we discussed earlier (0.325 + 0.625 = 1 in the first calculation, 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 in the second, and 0.99 + 0.01 = 1 in the third).

The expected return on an asset reflects the return that you can expect to receive from investing in that asset over the period that you plan to own it. It is your best estimate of this return, given the possible outcomes and their associated probabilities.

Note that if each of the possible outcomes is equally likely (that is, p1 = p2 = p3 = … = pn = p = 1/n), this formula reduces to the formula for a simple (equally weighted) average of the possible returns:

To see how we calculate the expected return on an asset, suppose you are considering purchasing Twitter, Inc. stock for $44.00 per share. You plan to sell the stock in one year. You estimate that there is a 30 percent chance that Twitter stock will sell for $41.50 at the end of one year, a 30 percent chance that it will sell for $47.00, a 30 percent chance that it will sell for $48.25, and a 10 percent chance that it will sell for $50.00. If Twitter pays no dividends on its shares, what is the return that you expect from this stock in the next year?

With no dividends, the total return on Twitter stock equals the return from capital appreciation:

Therefore, we can calculate the return from owning Twitter stock under each of the four possible outcomes using the approach we used for the Twitter problem we solved earlier in the chapter. These returns are calculated as follows:

Twitter Stock Price in One Year	Total Return
$41.50	
$47.00	
$48.25	
$50.00	
Applying Equation 7.2, the expected return on Twitter stock over the next year is therefore 4.60 percent, calculated as follows:

Notice that the negative return is entered into the formula just like any other. Also notice that the sum of the pi’s equals 1.

Learning by Doing Application 7.2 and Decision Making Example 7.1 illustrate another expected return calculation and the application of expected returns in decision making.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 7.2
Calculating Expected Returns

Problem

You have just purchased 100 railroad cars that you plan to lease (rent) to a large railroad company. Demand for shipping goods by rail has recently increased due to the rising price of oil. You expect oil prices, which are currently at $74.56 per barrel, to reach $98.00 per barrel in the next year. If this happens, railroad shipping prices will increase, thereby driving up the value of your railroad cars as increases in demand outpace the rate at which new cars are being produced.

Given your oil price prediction, you estimate that there is a 30 percent chance that the value of your railroad cars will increase by 15 percent, a 40 percent chance that their value will increase by 25 percent, and a 30 percent chance that their value will increase by 30 percent in the next year. In addition to appreciation in the value of your cars, you expect to earn 10 percent on your investment over the next year (after expenses) from leasing the railroad cars. What total return do you expect to earn on your railroad car investment over the next year?





DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 7.1
Using Expected Values in Decision Making

Situation

You are deciding whether you should advertise your pizza business on the radio or on billboards placed on local taxicabs. For $1,000 per month, you can either buy 20 one-minute ads on the radio or place your ad on 40 taxicabs.

There is some uncertainty regarding how many new customers will visit your restaurant after hearing one of your radio ads. You estimate that there is a 30 percent chance that 35 people will visit, a 45 percent chance that 50 people will visit, and a 25 percent chance that 60 people will visit. Therefore, you expect the following number of new customers to visit your restaurant in response to each radio ad:

This means that you expect 20 one-minute ads to bring in 20 × 48 = 960 new customers.

Similarly, you estimate that there is a 20 percent chance you will get 20 new customers in response to an ad placed on a taxi, a 30 percent chance you will get 30 new customers, a 30 percent chance that you will get 40 new customers, and a 20 percent chance that you will get 50 new customers. Therefore, you expect the following number of new customers in response to each ad that you place on a taxi:

Placing ads on 40 taxicabs is therefore expected to bring in 40 × 35 = 1,400 new customers.

Which of these two advertising options is more attractive? Is it cost-effective?



Before You Go On
How is the expected return on an investment calculated?
7.4 Variance and Standard Deviation as Measures of Risk
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what the standard deviation of returns is and why it is very useful in finance, and calculate it for an asset.
We turn next to a discussion of the two most basic measures of risk used in finance—variance and standard deviation. These are the same variance and standard deviation measures that you studied if you took a course in statistics.

Calculating Variance and Standard Deviation
Let’s begin by returning to our College World Series example. Recall that you will receive a bonus of $800,000 if you get a hit in your final collegiate at-bat and a bonus of $400,000 if you do not. The expected value of your bonus is $530,000. Suppose you want to measure the risk, or uncertainty, associated with the bonus. How can you do this? One approach would be to compute a measure of how much, on average, the bonus payoffs deviate from the expected value. The underlying intuition is that the greater the difference between the actual bonus and the expected value, the greater the risk. For example, you might calculate the difference between each possible bonus payment and the expected value, and sum these differences. If you do this, you will get the following result:

Unfortunately, using this calculation to obtain a measure of risk presents two problems. First, since one difference is positive and the other difference is negative, one difference partially cancels the other. As a result, you are not getting an accurate measure of total risk. Second, this calculation does not take into account the number of potential outcomes or the probability of each outcome.

A better approach would be to square the differences (squaring the differences makes all the numbers positive) and multiply each squared difference by its associated probability before summing them up. This calculation yields the variance (σ2) of the possible outcomes. The variance does not suffer from the two problems associated with the above calculation and provides a measure of risk that has a consistent interpretation across different situations or assets. For the original bonus arrangement, the variance is:

variance (σ2) a measure of the uncertainty associated with an outcome

Note that the square of the Greek symbol sigma, σ2, is generally used to represent the variance.

Because it is somewhat awkward to work with units of squared dollars, in a calculation such as this we would typically take the square root of the variance. The square root gives us the standard deviation (σ) of the possible outcomes. For our example, the standard deviation is:

standard deviation (σ) the square root of the variance

As you will see when we discuss the normal distribution, the standard deviation has a natural interpretation that is very useful for assessing investment risks.

The general formula for calculating the variance of returns can be written as follows:

(7.3)
Equation 7.3 simply extends the calculation illustrated above to the situation where there are n possible outcomes. Like the expected return calculation (Equation 7.2), Equation 7.3 can be simplified if all of the possible outcomes are equally likely. In this case, it becomes:

In both the general case and the case where all possible outcomes are equally likely, the standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance .

Interpreting Variance and Standard Deviation
The variance and standard deviation are especially useful measures of risk for variables that are normally distributed—those that can be represented by a normal distribution. The normal distribution is a symmetric frequency distribution that is completely described by its mean (average) and standard deviation. Exhibit 7.1 illustrates what this distribution looks like. Even if you have never taken a statistics course, you have already encountered the normal distribution. It is the “bell curve” on which instructors often base their grade distributions. SAT scores and IQ scores are also based on normal distributions.

normal distribution a symmetric frequency distribution that is completely described by its mean and standard deviation; also known as a bell curve due to its shape

This distribution is very useful in finance because the returns for many assets are approximately normally distributed. This makes the variance and standard deviation practical measures of the uncertainty associated with investment returns. Since the standard deviation is more easily interpreted than the variance, we will focus on the standard deviation as we discuss the normal distribution and its application in finance.

In Exhibit 7.1, you can see that the normal distribution is symmetric: the left and right sides are mirror images of each other. The mean falls directly in the center of the distribution, and the probability that an outcome is less than or greater than a particular distance from the mean is the same whether the outcome is on the left or the right side of the distribution. For example, if the mean is 0, the probability that a particular outcome is −3 or less is the same as the probability that it is +3 or more (both are 3 or more units from the mean). This enables us to use a single measure of risk for the normal distribution. That measure is the standard deviation.

The standard deviation tells us everything we need to know about the width of the normal distribution or, in other words, the variation in the individual values. This variation is what we are referring to when we talk about risk in finance. In general terms, risk is a measure of the range of potential outcomes. The standard deviation is an especially useful measure of risk because it tells us the probability that an outcome will fall a particular distance from the mean, or within a particular range. You can see this in the following table, which shows the fraction of all observations in a normal distribution that are within the indicated number of standard deviations from the mean.

EXHIBIT 7.1 Normal Distribution The normal distribution is a symmetric distribution that is completely described by its mean and standard deviation. The mean is the value that defines the center of the distribution, and the standard deviation, σ, describes the dispersion of the values centered around the mean.


Number of Standard Deviations from the Mean	Fraction of Total Observations
1.000	68.26%
1.645	     90%
1.960	     95%
2.575	     99%
Since the returns on many assets are approximately normally distributed, the standard deviation provides a convenient way of computing the probability that the return on an asset will fall within a particular range. In these applications, the expected return on an asset equals the mean of the distribution, and the standard deviation is a measure of the uncertainty associated with the return.

For example, if the expected return for a real estate investment in Miami, Florida, is 10 percent with a standard deviation of 2 percent, there is a 90 percent chance that the actual return will be within 3.29 percent of 10 percent. How do we know this? As shown in the table above, 90 percent of all outcomes in a normal distribution have a value that is within 1.645 standard deviations of the mean value, and 1.645 × 2 percent = 3.29 percent. This tells us that there is a 90 percent chance that the realized return on the investment in Miami will be between 6.71 percent (10 percent − 3.29 percent = 6.71 percent) and 13.29 percent (10 percent + 3.29 percent = 13.29 percent), a range of 6.58 percent (13.29 percent − 6.71 percent = 6.58 percent).

You may be wondering what is standard about the standard deviation. The answer is that this statistic is standard in the sense that it can be used to directly compare the uncertainties (risks) associated with the returns on different investments. For instance, suppose you are comparing the real estate investment in Miami with a real estate investment in Fresno, California. Assume that the expected return on the Fresno investment is also 10 percent. If the standard deviation for the returns on the Fresno investment is 3 percent, there is a 90 percent chance that the actual return is within 4.935 percent (1.645 × 3 percent = 4.935 percent) of 10 percent. In other words, 90 percent of the time, the return will be between 5.065 percent (10 percent − 4.935 percent = 5.065 percent) and 14.935 percent (10 percent + 4.935 percent = 14.935 percent), a range of 9.87 percent (14.935 percent − 5.065 percent = 9.87 percent).

This range is exactly 9.87 percent/6.58 percent = 1.5 times as large as the range for the Miami investment opportunity. Notice that the ratio of the two standard deviations also equals 1.5 (3 percent/2 percent = 1.5). This is not a coincidence. We could have used the standard deviations to directly compute the relative uncertainty associated with the Fresno and Miami investment returns. The relation between the standard deviation of returns and the width of a normal distribution (the uncertainty) is illustrated in Exhibit 7.2. As you can see in the exhibit, the larger the standard deviation, the riskier the investment.

Let’s consider another example of how the standard deviation is interpreted. Suppose customers at your pizza restaurant have complained that there is no consistency in the number of slices of pepperoni that your cooks are putting on large pepperoni pizzas. One night you decide to work in the area where the pizzas are made so that you can count the number of pepperoni slices on the large pizzas to get a better idea of just how much variation there is. After counting the slices of pepperoni on 50 pizzas, you estimate that, on average, your pizzas have 18 slices of pepperoni and that the standard deviation is 3 slices.

With this information, you estimate that 95 percent of the large pepperoni pizzas sold in your restaurant have between 12.12 and 23.88 pepperoni slices. You are able to estimate this range because you know that 95 percent of the observations in a normal distribution fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. With a standard deviation of three slices, this implies that the number of pepperoni slices on 95 percent of your pizzas is within 5.88 slices of the mean (3 slices × 1.96 = 5.88 slices). This, in turn, indicates a range of 12.12 (18 − 5.88 = 12.12) to 23.88 (18 + 5.88 = 23.88) slices.

Since you put only whole slices of pepperoni on your pizzas, 95 percent of the time the number of slices is somewhere between 12 and 24. That’s a big difference, so it is no wonder your customers are up in arms! In response to this information, you decide to implement a standard policy regarding the number of pepperoni slices that go on each type of pizza.

Learning by Doing Application 7.3 illustrates application of a normal distribution to the analysis of a stock return.

EXHIBIT 7.2 Standard Deviation and Width of the Normal Distribution The larger standard deviation for the return on the Fresno investment means that the Fresno investment is riskier than the Miami investment. The actual return for the Fresno investment is more likely to be further from its expected return.

Understanding the Standard Deviation

Problem

You are considering investing in a share of Mastercard Inc. stock and want to evaluate how risky this potential investment is. You know that stock returns tend to be normally distributed, and you have calculated the expected return on Mastercard stock to be 4.67 percent and the standard deviation of the annual return to be 23 percent. Based on these statistics, within what range would you expect the return on this stock to fall during the next year? Calculate this range for a 90 percent level of confidence (that is, 90 percent of the time, the returns will fall within the specified range).





Historical Market Performance
Now that we have discussed how returns and risks can be measured, we are ready to examine the characteristics of the historical returns earned by securities such as stocks and bonds. Exhibit 7.3 illustrates the distributions of historical returns for some securities in the United States and shows the average and standard deviations of these annual returns for the period from 1926 to 2019.

Note that the statistics reported in Exhibit 7.3 are for indexes that represent total average returns for the indicated types of securities, not total returns on individual securities. We generally use indexes to represent the performance of the stock or bond markets. For instance, when news services report on the performance of the stock market, they often report that the Dow Jones Industrial Average (an index based on 30 large stocks), the S&P 500 Index (an index based on 500 large stocks), or the NASDAQ Composite Index (an index based on all stocks that are traded on NASDAQ) went up or down on a particular day. These and other indexes are discussed in Chapter 9.

The plots in Exhibit 7.3 are arranged from top to bottom in order of decreasing risk, which is indicated by the decreasing standard deviation of the annual returns. The top plot shows returns for a small-stock index that represents the 10 percent of U.S. firms that have the lowest total equity value (number of shares multiplied by price per share). The second plot shows returns for the S&P 500 Index, representing large U.S. stocks. The remaining plots show three different types of government debt: long-term government bonds that mature in 20 years, intermediate-term government bonds that mature in 5 years, and U.S. Treasury bills, which are short-term debts of the U.S. government, that mature in 30 days.

The key point to note in Exhibit 7.3 is that, on average, annual returns have been higher for riskier securities. Small stocks, which have the largest standard deviation of total returns, at 31.48 percent, also have the largest average annual return, 16.26 percent. On the other end of the spectrum, Treasury bills have the smallest standard deviation, 3.09 percent, and the smallest average annual return, 3.37 percent. Returns for small stocks in any particular year may have been higher or lower than returns for the other types of securities, but on average, they were higher. This is evidence that investors require higher returns for investments with greater risks.

EXHIBIT 7.3 Distributions of Annual Total Returns for U.S. Stocks and Bonds from 1926 to 2019 Higher standard deviations of returns have historically been associated with higher returns. For example, between 1926 and 2019, the standard deviation of the annual returns for small stocks was higher than the standard deviations of the returns earned by other types of securities, and the average return that investors earned from small stocks was also higher. At the other end of the spectrum, the returns on Treasury bills had the smallest standard deviation, and Treasury bills earned the smallest average return.

The statistics in Exhibit 7.3 describe actual investment returns, as opposed to expected returns. In other words, they represent what has happened in the past. Financial analysts often use historical numbers such as these to estimate the returns that might be expected in the future. That is exactly what we did in the baseball example earlier in this chapter. We used the percentage of at-bats in which you got a hit this past season to estimate the likelihood that you would get a hit in your last collegiate at-bat. We assumed that your past performance was a reasonable indicator of your future performance.

To see how historical numbers are used in finance, let’s suppose that you are considering investing in a fund that mimics the S&P 500 Index (this is what we call an index fund) and that you want to estimate what the returns on the S&P 500 Index are likely to be in the future. If you believe that the 1926 to 2019 period provides a reasonable indication of what we can expect in the future, then the average historical return on the S&P 500 Index of 12.09 percent provides a perfectly reasonable estimate of the return you can expect from your investment in the S&P 500 Index fund. In Chapter 13 we will explore in detail how historical data can be used in this way to estimate the discount rate for evaluating projects in the capital budgeting process.

Comparing the historical returns for an individual stock with the historical returns for an index can also be instructive. Exhibit 7.4 shows such a comparison for Apple Inc. and the S&P 500 Index using monthly returns for the period from September 2015 through September 2020. Notice in the exhibit that the returns for Apple stock are much more volatile than the average returns for the firms represented in the S&P 500 Index. In other words, the standard deviation of returns for Apple stock is higher than that for the S&P 500 Index. This is not a coincidence; we will discuss shortly why returns on individual stocks tend to be riskier than returns on indexes.

One last point is worth noting while we are examining historical returns: the value of a $1.00 investment in 1926 would have varied greatly by 2019, depending on where that dollar was invested. Exhibit 7.5 shows that $1.00 invested in U.S. Treasury bills in 1926 would have been worth $21.60 by 2019. In contrast, that same $1.00 invested in small stocks would have been worth $39,381.93 by 2019.2 Over a long period of time, earning higher rates of return can have a dramatic impact on the value of an investment. This huge difference reflects the impact of compounding of returns (returns earned on returns), much like the compounding of interest we discussed in Chapter 5.

EXHIBIT 7.4 Monthly Returns for Apple Inc. stock and the S&P 500 Index from September 2015 through September 2020 The returns on shares of individual stocks tend to be much more volatile than the returns on portfolios of stocks, such as the S&P 500.


EXHIBIT 7.5 Cumulative Value of $1 Invested in 1926 The value of a $1 investment in stocks, small or large, grew much more rapidly than the value of a $1 investment in bonds or Treasury bills over the 1926 to 2019 period. This graph illustrates how earning a higher rate of return over a long period of time can affect the value of an investment portfolio. Although annual stock returns were less certain between 1926 and 2019, the returns on stock investments were much greater.

What relation do we generally observe between risk and return when we examine historical returns?
7.5 Arithmetic Average and Geometric (Compounded) Average Returns
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what an arithmetic average return is and what a geometric average return is, and calculate these returns for an asset.
The average returns reported for the different types of U.S. stocks and bonds in Exhibit 7.3 are known as arithmetic average returns. These returns are calculated for each type of stock or bond by simply adding up the returns during each year from 1926 through 2019 and then dividing by the total number of years. This calculation tells us the return that was earned in an average year during the 94-year period from 1926 to 2019. An arithmetic average return can be calculated for an investment period of any length, such as a day, month, quarter, or year, by adding the returns across all periods and dividing by the total number of periods. Equation 7.4 shows this calculation.

(7.4)
where:

arithmetic average return the return earned in an average period

While the arithmetic average return is helpful in comparing the annual returns earned on investments in the different types of U.S. stocks and bonds in Exhibit 7.3, it does not tell us the average annual return an investor would have earned on an investment in a particular stock or bond.

For example, the 12.09 percent arithmetic average annual return on large U.S. stocks does not mean that a $1 investment in large U.S. stocks in 1926 would have grown at a compounded rate of 12.09 percent through 2019. If it had done this, that investment would have grown to $45,633.70 [$1 × (1 + 0.1209)94 = $45,633.70], when, in fact, Exhibit 7.5 shows that it grew to only $9,229.00.

The future value formula, Equation 5.1, tells us that this $9,229.00 value implies a compounded average annual return on large U.S. stocks from 1926 to 2019 of only 10.02 percent:

Why is there a difference between the arithmetic average return and the average return that an investor actually earned? The answer is that the compounded average annual return that an investor earns, which we call the geometric (compounded) average return, is sensitive to variation in returns over time. To see this, consider a two-year investment of $1 that returns 6.95 percent in Year 1 and 16.95 percent in Year 2. This investment, which has an arithmetic average return of 11.95 percent [(6.95 percent + 16.95 percent)/2 = 11.95 percent], will be worth $1.25 in Year 2 [Value in Year 2 = (1 + 0.0695)(1 + 0.1695) = $1.25], which implies a geometric (compounded) average return of:

geometric (compounded) average return average compounded return earned by an investor

In contrast, if the return is 11.95 percent in both years, the arithmetic and geometric average returns both equal 11.95 percent. The fact that the return is not the same each year causes the geometric average return to differ from the arithmetic average return. The more variation there is in the year-to-year return, the greater the difference between the arithmetic and geometric returns.

Note that in the preceding example, in which the returns are 6.95 percent and 16.95 percent, we can write the equation for the geometric average return as:

If we substitute RGeometric average for i, the general form of this equation can be written as:

(7.5)
where:

The geometric average return will always be lower than the arithmetic average return when there is year-to-year variation in returns because of the difference in the way that the two calculations treat the dollar value of percentage changes. For example, suppose that you invest $1 for two years and your investment earns 15 percent in Year 1 and loses 15 percent in Year 2. The arithmetic average return would be 0 percent [(15 percent + −15 percent)/2 = 0 percent], but the geometric average would be −1.13 percent ([(1 + 0.15)(1 + −0.15)]1/2 – 1 = −0.0113). The lower geometric return reflects the fact that the positive return in Year 1 represents a $0.15 increase in value (0.15 × $1 = $0.15) while the negative return in Year 2 represents a $0.17 decrease in value (−0.15 × [$1 × (1 + 0.15)] = −$0.17). The difference is that the 15 percent increase in Year 1 is based on a smaller dollar amount (the $1 starting value) than the 15 percent decrease in Year 2, which is a decrease from the Year 1 value of $1.15. The arithmetic average return calculation treats both changes equally while the geometric average calculation accounts for the difference.

7.6 Risk and Diversification
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the concept of diversification and its effect on risk.
It does not generally make sense to invest all of your money in a single asset. The reason is directly related to the fact that returns on individual stocks tend to be riskier than returns on indexes. By investing in two or more assets whose values do not always move in the same direction at the same time, an investor can reduce the risk of his or her collection of investments, or portfolio. This is the idea behind the concept of diversification.

portfolio the collection of assets an investor owns

diversification reducing risk by investing in two or more assets whose values do not always move in the same direction at the same time

This section develops the tools necessary to evaluate the benefits of diversification. We begin with a discussion of how to quantify risk and return for a single-asset portfolio, and then we discuss more realistic and complicated portfolios that have two or more assets. Although our discussion focuses on stock portfolios, it is important to recognize that the concepts discussed apply equally well to portfolios that include a range of assets, such as stocks, bonds, gold, art, and real estate, among others.

Single-Asset Portfolios
Returns for individual stocks from one day to the next have been found to be largely independent of each other and approximately normally distributed. In other words, the return for a stock on one day is largely independent of the return on that same stock the next day, two days later, three days later, and so on. Each daily return can be viewed as having been randomly drawn from a normal distribution where the probability associated with the return depends on how far it is from the expected value. If we know what the expected value and standard deviation are for the distribution of returns for a stock, it is possible to quantify the risks and expected returns that an investment in the stock might yield in the future.

To see how we might do this, assume that you are considering investing in one of two stocks for the next year: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) or Intel. Also, to keep things simple, assume that there are only three possible economic conditions (outcomes) a year from now and that the returns on AMD and Intel under each of these outcomes are as follows:

Economic Outcome	Probability	AMD Return	Intel Return
Poor	0.2	–0.13	–0.10
Neutral	0.5	  0.10	  0.07
Good	0.3	  0.25	  0.22
With this information, we can calculate the expected returns for AMD and Intel by using Equation 7.2:

and

Similarly, we can calculate the standard deviations of the returns for AMD and Intel in the same way that we calculated the standard deviation for our baseball bonus example in Section 7.2:

and

Having calculated the expected returns and standard deviations for AMD and Intel stock, the natural question to ask is which provides the higher risk-adjusted return. Before we answer this question, let’s return to the example at the beginning of Section 7.1. Recall that, in this example, we proposed choosing among three stocks: A, B, and C. We stated that investors would prefer the investment that provides the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given expected return. This made it fairly easy to choose between Stocks A and B, which had the same return but different risk, and between Stocks B and C, which had the same risk but different returns. We were stuck when trying to choose between Stocks A and C, however, because they differed in both risk and return. Now, armed with tools for quantifying expected returns and risk, we can at least take a first pass at comparing stocks such as these.

The coefficient of variation (CV) is a measure that can help us in making comparisons such as that between Stocks A and C. The coefficient of variation for stock i is calculated as:

(7.6)
coefficient of variation (CV) a measure of the risk associated with an investment for each 1 percent of expected return

In this equation, CV is a measure of the risk associated with an investment for each 1 percent of expected return.

Recall that Stock A has an expected return of 12 percent and a risk level of 12 percent, while Stock C has an expected return of 16 percent and a risk level of 16 percent. If we assume that the risk level given for each stock is equal to the standard deviation of its return, we can find the coefficients of variation for the stocks as follows:

Since these values are equal, the coefficient of variation measure suggests that these two investments are equally attractive on a risk-adjusted basis.

While this analysis appears to make sense, there is a conceptual problem with using the coefficient of variation to compute the amount of risk an investor can expect to realize for each 1 percent of expected return. This problem arises because investors expect to earn a positive return even when assets are completely risk free. For example, as shown in Exhibit 7.3, from 1926 to 2019 investors earned an average return of 3.37 percent each year on 30-day Treasury bills, which are considered to be risk free.3 If investors can earn a positive risk-free rate without bearing any risk, then it really only makes sense to compare the risk of the investment, , with the return that investors expect to earn over and above the risk-free rate. As we will discuss in detail in Section 7.7, the expected return over and above the risk-free rate is a measure of the return that investors expect to earn for bearing risk.

This suggests that we should use the difference between the expected return, E(Ri), and the risk-free rate, Rrf, instead of E(Ri) alone in the coefficient of variation calculation. With this change, Equation 7.6 would be written as:

where is a modified coefficient of variation that is computed by subtracting the risk-free rate from the expected return.

Let’s compute this modified coefficient of variation for the AMD and Intel example. If the risk-free rate equals 0.03, or 3 percent, the modified coefficients of variation for the two stocks are:

We can see that the modified coefficient of variation for AMD is smaller than the modified coefficient of variation for Intel. This tells us that an investment in AMD stock is expected to have less risk for each 1 percent of return. Since investors prefer less risk for a given level of return, the AMD stock is a more attractive investment.

A popular version of this modified coefficient of variation calculation is known as the Sharpe Ratio. This ratio is named after 1990 Nobel Prize Laureate William Sharpe, who developed the concept and was one of the originators of the Capital Asset Pricing Model that is discussed in Section 7.8. The Sharpe Ratio is simply the inverse of the modified coefficient of variation:

(7.7)
Sharpe Ratio a measure of the return per unit of risk for an investment

For the stocks of AMD and Intel, the Sharpe Ratios are:

This tells us that investors in AMD stock can expect to earn 0.524 percent for each one standard deviation of return while investors in Intel stock can expect to earn 0.458 percent for each one standard deviation of return. Many people find the Sharpe Ratio to be a more intuitive measure than the coefficient of variation because they find it easier to think about the return per unit of risk than risk per unit of return.

Learning by Doing Application 7.4 illustrates other Sharpe Ratio calculations.

Portfolios with More Than One Asset
It may seem like a good idea to evaluate investments by calculating a measure of risk for each 1 percent of expected return or the expected return per unit of risk. However, the coefficient of variation and the Sharpe Ratio have a critical shortcoming that is not quite evident when we are considering only a single asset. In order to explain this shortcoming, we must discuss the more realistic setting in which an investor has constructed a portfolio with more than one asset.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 7.4
Calculating and Interpreting the Sharpe Ratio

Problem

You are trying to choose between two investments. The first investment, a painting by Picasso, has an expected return of 14 percent with a standard deviation of 30 percent over the next year. The second investment, a pair of blue suede shoes once worn by Elvis, has an expected return of 20 percent with a standard deviation of 40 percent. The risk-free rate of interest is 3 percent. What is the Sharpe Ratio for each of these investments, and what do these ratios tell us?





Expected Return on a Portfolio with More Than One Asset

Suppose you own a portfolio that consists of $500 of AMD stock and $500 of Intel stock and that over the next year you expect to earn returns on the AMD and Intel shares of 9.9 percent and 8.1 percent, respectively. How would you calculate the expected return for the overall portfolio?

Let’s try to answer this question using our intuition. If half of your funds are invested in each stock, it would seem reasonable that the expected return for this portfolio should be a 50–50 mixture of the expected returns from the two stocks, or:

Notice that this formula is just like the expected return formula for an individual stock. However, in this case, instead of multiplying outcomes by their associated probabilities, we are multiplying expected returns for individual stocks by the fraction of the total portfolio value that each of these stocks represents. In other words, the formula for the expected return for a two-stock portfolio is:

where x1 represents the fraction of the portfolio invested in asset 1, and x2 represents the fraction of the portfolio invested in asset 2. The corresponding equation for a portfolio with n assets is:

(7.8)
where xi represents the fraction of the portfolio invested in asset i. Equation 7.8 is just like Equation 7.2, except that (1) the returns are expected returns for individual assets and (2) instead of multiplying by the probability of an outcome, we are multiplying by the fraction of the portfolio invested in each asset. Note that this equation can be used only if you have already calculated the expected return for each stock.

To see how Equation 7.8 is used to calculate the expected return on a portfolio with more than two assets, consider an example. Suppose that you were recently awarded a $500,000 grant from a national foundation to pursue your interest in advancing the art of noodling—a popular pastime in some parts of the country in which people catch 40- to 50-pound catfish by putting their hands into catfish holes and wiggling their fingers like noodles to attract the fish.4 Since your grant is intended to support your activities for five years, you kept $100,000 to cover your expenses for the next year and invested the remaining $400,000 in U.S. Treasury bonds and stocks. Specifically, you invested $100,000 in Treasury bonds (TB) that yield 4.5 percent; $150,000 in Procter & Gamble stock (P&G), which has an expected return of 7.5 percent; and $150,000 in Exxon Mobil Corporation stock (EMC), which has an expected return of 9.0 percent. What is the expected return on this $400,000 portfolio?

In order to use Equation 7.8, we must first calculate xi, the fraction of the portfolio invested in asset i, for each investment. These fractions are as follows:

Therefore, the expected return on the portfolio is:

Learning by Doing Application 7.5 illustrates another expected return calculation for a portfolio.

Risk of a Portfolio with More Than One Asset

Now that we have calculated the expected return on a portfolio with more than one asset, the next question is how to quantify the risk of such a portfolio. Before we discuss the mechanics of how to do this, it is important to have some intuitive understanding of how variances in the returns for different assets interact to determine the variance of the overall portfolio.

You have become concerned that you have too much of your money invested in your pizza restaurant and have decided to diversify your personal portfolio. Right now the pizza restaurant is your only investment. To diversify, you plan to sell 45 percent of your restaurant and invest the proceeds from the sale, in equal proportions, into a stock market index fund and a bond market index fund. Over the next year, you expect to earn a return of 15 percent on your remaining investment in the pizza restaurant, 12 percent on your investment in the stock market index fund, and 8 percent on your investment in the bond market index fund. What return will you expect from your diversified portfolio over the next year?





EXHIBIT 7.6 Monthly Returns for American Airlines and Target Stock from September 2015 through September 2020 The returns on two stocks are generally different. In some periods, the return on one stock is positive, while the return on the other is negative. Even when the returns on both are positive or negative, they are rarely exactly the same.


The prices of two stocks in a portfolio will rarely, if ever, change by the same amount and in the same direction at the same time. Normally, the price of one stock will change by more than the price of the other. In fact, the prices of two stocks will frequently move in different directions. These differences in price movements affect the total variance of the returns for a portfolio.

Exhibit 7.6 shows monthly returns for the stock of American Airlines and Target over the period from September 2015 through September 2020. Notice that the returns on these shares are generally different and that the prices of the shares can move in different directions in a given month (one stock has a positive return when the other has a negative return). When the stock prices move in opposite directions, the change in the price of one stock offsets at least some of the change in the price of the other stock. As a result, the level of risk for a portfolio of the two stocks is less than the average of the risks associated with the individual shares.

This means that we cannot calculate the variance of a portfolio containing two assets simply by calculating the weighted average of the variances of the individual stocks. We have to account for the fact that the returns on different shares in a portfolio tend to partially offset each other. For a two-asset portfolio, we calculate the variance of the returns using the following formula:

(7.9)
where x1 represents the fraction of the portfolio invested in stock 1, is the variance of the return of stock 1, x2 represents the fraction of the portfolio invested in stock 2, is the variance of the return of stock 2, and is the covariance of the returns between stocks 1 and 2. The covariance of returns is a measure of how the returns on two assets covary, or move together. The third term in Equation 7.9, the covariance, accounts for the fact that returns from the two assets will offset each other to some extent. The covariance of returns is calculated using the following formula:

(7.10)
covariance of returns a measure of how the returns on two assets covary, or move together

where i represents outcomes rather than assets. Compare this equation with Equation 7.3, reproduced here:

You can see that the covariance calculation is very similar to the variance calculation. The difference is that, instead of squaring the difference between the return from each outcome and the expected return for an individual asset, we calculate the product of this difference for two different assets.

Just as it is difficult to directly interpret the variance of the returns for an asset—recall that the variance is in units of squared dollars—it is difficult to directly interpret the covariance of returns between two assets. We get around this problem by dividing the covariance of returns by the product of the standard deviations of the returns for the two assets. This gives us the correlation, ρ, between the returns on those assets:

(7.11)
The correlation between the returns on two assets will always have a value between −1 and +1. This makes the interpretation of this variable straightforward. A negative correlation means that the returns tend to have opposite signs. That is, when the return on one asset is positive, the return on the other asset tends to be negative. If the correlation is exactly −1, the returns on the two assets are perfectly negatively correlated. In other words, when the return on one asset is positive, the return on the other asset will always be negative. A positive correlation means that when the return on one asset is positive, the return on the other asset also tends to be positive. If the correlation is exactly equal to +1, then the returns of the two assets are said to be perfectly positively correlated. That is, the return on one asset will always be positive when the return on the other asset is positive. Finally, a correlation of 0 means that the returns on the assets are not correlated. In this case, the fact that the return on one asset is positive or negative tells you nothing about how likely it is that the return on the other asset will be positive or negative.

Let’s work an example to see how Equation 7.9 is used to calculate the variance of the returns on a portfolio that consists of 50 percent American Airlines stock and 50 percent Target stock. Using the data plotted in Exhibit 7.6, we can calculate the variance of the annual returns for the American Airlines and Target stocks, , to be 0.1795 and 0.0847, respectively. The covariance between the annual returns on these two stocks is 0.0255. We do not show the calculations for the variances and the covariance because each of these numbers was calculated using 60 different monthly returns. These calculations are too cumbersome to illustrate. Rest assured, however, that they were calculated using Equations 7.3 and 7.10.5 With these values, we can calculate the variance of a portfolio that consists of 50 percent American Airlines (AAL) stock and 50 percent Target (TGT) stock as:

You can see that this portfolio variance is smaller than the average of the variances of the returns on the American Airlines and Target stocks [(0.1795 + 0.0847)/2 = 0.1321]. This is because their returns are not perfectly positively correlated. Indeed, in this case, the portfolio variance is lower than the individual variances of both stocks.

If we calculate the standard deviations by taking the square roots of the variances, we find that the standard deviations for American Airlines stock, Target stock, and the portfolio consisting of those two stocks are 0.424 (42.4 percent), 0.291 (29.1 percent), and 0.281 (28.1 percent), respectively.

Exhibit 7.7 illustrates the monthly returns for the portfolio of American Airlines and Target stock, along with the monthly returns for the individual stocks. You can see in this exhibit that the returns on the portfolio vary quite a bit. However, as noted above, this variation is less than the average variation in the returns for the individual company shares.

Using Equation 7.11, we can calculate the correlation of the returns between American Airlines and Target stock as:

EXHIBIT 7.7 Monthly Returns for American Airlines and Target Stock and for a Portfolio with 50 Percent of the Value in Each of These Two Stocks from September 2015 through September 2020 The variation in the returns from a portfolio that consists of American Airlines and Target stock in equal proportions is less than the variation in the returns from either of those stocks alone.


The positive correlation tells us that the prices of American Airlines and Target stock tend to move in the same direction. However, the correlation of less than 1 tells us that they do not always do so. The fact that the prices of these two shares do not always move together is the reason that the returns on a portfolio of the two stocks have less variation than the average variation of the returns on the individual company shares. This example illustrates the benefit of diversification—how holding more than one asset with different risk characteristics can reduce the risk of a portfolio. Note that if the correlation of the returns between American Airlines and Target stock equaled 1, holding these two stocks would not reduce risk because their prices would always move up or down together. Also, the standard deviation of the returns on the portfolio would equal the average of the standard deviations of the returns on the individual stocks.6

As we add more and more assets to a portfolio, calculating the variance using the approach illustrated in Equation 7.9 becomes increasingly complex. The reason for this is that we have to account for the covariance between each pair of assets. These more extensive calculations are beyond the scope of this book, but they are conceptually the same as those for a portfolio with two assets.

Learning by Doing Application 7.6 illustrates another calculation of the variance for a two-asset portfolio.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 7.6
Calculating the Variance of a Two-Asset Portfolio

Problem

You are still planning to sell 45 percent of your pizza restaurant in order to diversify your personal portfolio. However, you have now decided to invest all of the proceeds in the stock market index fund. After you diversify, you will have 55 percent of your wealth invested in the restaurant and 45 percent invested in the stock market index fund. You have estimated the variances of the returns for these two investments and the covariance between their returns to be as follows:

What will be the variance and standard deviation of returns in your portfolio after you have sold the ownership interest in your restaurant and invested in the stock market index fund?





The Limits of Diversification
In the sample calculations for the portfolio containing American Airlines and Target stock, we saw that the standard deviation of the returns from September 2015 through September 2020 for a portfolio consisting of equal investments in those two stocks was 28.1 percent and that this figure was lower than the average of the standard deviation of returns for the individual stocks. You might wonder how the standard deviation for the portfolio is likely to change if we increase the number of assets in the portfolio. The answer is simple. If the returns on the individual stocks added to our portfolio do not all change in the same way (are not perfectly correlated), then increasing the number of stocks in the portfolio will reduce the standard deviation of the portfolio returns even further.

Building Intuition
Diversified Portfolios Are Less Risky

Diversified portfolios generally have less risk for a given level of return than the individual risky assets in the portfolio. This is because the values of individual assets rarely change by the same amount and in the same direction at the same time. As a result, some of the variation in an asset’s value can be diversified away by owning another asset at the same time. This is important because it tells us that investors can eliminate some of the risk associated with individual investments by holding them in a diversified portfolio.

Let’s consider a simple example to illustrate this point. Suppose that all assets have a standard deviation of returns that is equal to 40 percent and that the covariance between the returns for each pair of assets is 0.048. If we form a portfolio in which we have an equal investment in two assets, the standard deviation of returns for the portfolio will be 32.25 percent. If we add a third asset, the portfolio standard deviation of returns will decrease to 29.21 percent. It will be even lower, at 27.57 percent, for a four-asset portfolio. Exhibit 7.8 illustrates how the standard deviation for the portfolio declines as more stocks are added.

In addition to showing how increasing the number of assets decreases the overall risk of a portfolio, Exhibit 7.8 illustrates three other very important points. First, the decrease in the standard deviation for the portfolio gets smaller and smaller as more assets are added. You can see this effect by looking at the distance between the straight horizontal line and the plot of the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.

The second important point is this: as the number of assets becomes very large, the portfolio standard deviation does not approach zero; it decreases only so far. In the example in Exhibit 7.8, it approaches 21.9 percent. The standard deviation does not approach zero because we are assuming that the variations in the asset returns do not completely cancel each other out. This is a realistic assumption because in practice investors cannot diversify away all risk. They can diversify away risk that is unique to the individual assets, but they cannot diversify away risk that is common to all assets. The risk investors can diversify away is called unsystematic or diversifiable risk, and the risk they cannot diversify away is called systematic or nondiversifiable risk. In the next section, we will discuss systematic risk in detail.

unsystematic or diversifiable risk risk that can be eliminated through diversification

systematic or nondiversifiable risk risk that cannot be eliminated through diversification

EXHIBIT 7.8 Total Risk in a Portfolio as the Number of Assets Increases The total risk of a portfolio decreases as the number of assets increases. This is because the amount of unsystematic risk in the portfolio decreases. The diversification benefit from adding another asset declines as the total number of assets in the portfolio increases and the unsystematic risk approaches zero. Most of the diversification benefit can often be achieved with as few as 15 or 20 assets.


The third key point illustrated in Exhibit 7.8 is that most of the risk-reduction benefits from diversification can be achieved in a portfolio with 15 to 20 assets. Of course, the number of assets required to achieve a high level of diversification depends on the covariances between the assets in the portfolio. However, in general, it is not necessary to invest in a very large number of different assets.

7.7 Systematic Risk
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss why systematic risk matters to investors and how this measure relates to expected returns.
The objective of diversification is to eliminate variation in returns that is unique to individual assets. We diversify our investments across a number of different assets in the hope that their unique variations will cancel each other out. With complete diversification, all of the unsystematic risk is eliminated from the portfolio. An investor with a diversified portfolio still faces systematic risk, however, and we now turn our attention to that form of risk.

Why Systematic Risk Is All That Matters
The idea that unsystematic risk can be diversified away has direct implications for the relation between risk and return. If the transaction costs associated with constructing a diversified portfolio are relatively low, then rational, informed investors will prefer to hold diversified portfolios.

Diversified investors face only systematic risk, whereas investors whose portfolios are not well diversified face systematic risk plus unsystematic risk. Because they face less risk, the diversified investors will be willing to pay higher prices for individual assets than the other investors. Therefore, expected returns on individual assets will be lower than the total risk (systematic plus unsystematic risk) of those assets suggests they should be.

To illustrate, consider two individual investors, Emily and Jane. Each of them is trying to decide if she should purchase stock in your pizza restaurant. Emily holds a diversified portfolio and Jane does not. If your restaurant’s stock has systematic and unsystematic risk, Emily faces less risk than Jane (Emily can diversify away the unsystematic risk while Jane cannot) and will require a lower expected rate of return. Consequently, Emily will be willing to pay a higher price than Jane.

Building Intuition
Systematic Risk Is the Risk That Matters

The required rate of return on an asset depends only on the systematic risk associated with that asset. Because unsystematic risk can be diversified away, investors can and will eliminate their exposure to this risk. Competition among diversified investors will drive the prices of assets to the point where the expected returns will compensate investors for only the systematic risk that they bear.

If the market includes a large number of diversified investors such as Emily, competition among these investors will drive the price of your restaurant’s shares up further. This competition will ultimately push the price up to the point where the expected return just compensates all investors for the systematic risk associated with your stock. The bottom line is this: because of competition among diversified investors, all investors are only rewarded for bearing systematic risk in asset markets. For this reason, we are concerned only about systematic risk when we think about the relation between risk and return in finance.

Measuring Systematic Risk
If systematic risk is all that matters when we think about expected returns, then we cannot use the standard deviation of returns as a measure of risk.7 The standard deviation is a measure of total risk. We need a way of quantifying the systematic risk of individual assets.

A natural starting point for doing this is to recognize that the most diversified portfolio possible will come closest to eliminating all unsystematic risk. Such a portfolio provides a natural benchmark against which we can measure the systematic risk of an individual asset. What is the most diversified portfolio possible? The answer is simple. It is the portfolio that consists of all assets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, commodities, art, baseball cards, and so forth from all over the world. In finance, we call this the market portfolio.

market portfolio the portfolio of all assets

Unfortunately, we do not have very good data for most of these assets for most of the world, so we use the next best thing: the U.S. public stock market. A large number of stocks from a broad range of industries trade in this market. The companies that issue these stocks own a wide range of assets all over the world. These characteristics, combined with the facts that the U.S. market has been operating for a very long time and that we have very reliable and detailed information on prices for U.S. stocks, make the U.S. stock market a natural benchmark for estimating systematic risk.

Since systematic risk is, by definition, risk that cannot be diversified away, the systematic risk of an individual asset is really just a measure of the relation between the returns on the individual asset and the returns on the market portfolio, which has no unsystematic risk. In fact, systematic risk is often referred to as market risk. To see how we might use data from the U.S. public stock market to estimate the systematic risk of an individual asset, look at Exhibit 7.9, which plots 60 historical monthly returns for General Electric Company (GE) against the corresponding monthly returns for the S&P 500 Index (a proxy for the U.S. stock market). In this plot, you can see that returns on GE stock tend to be higher when returns on the S&P 500 tend to be higher. The measure of systematic risk that we use in finance is a statistical measure of this relation.

market risk a term commonly used to refer to nondiversifiable, or systematic, risk

EXHIBIT 7.9 Plot of Monthly General Electric Company Stock and S&P 500 Index Returns: September 2015 through September 2020 The monthly returns on General Electric stock are positively related to the returns on the S&P 500 Index. In other words, the return on General Electric’s stock tends to be higher when the return on the S&P 500 Index is higher and lower when the return on the S&P 500 Index is lower.


We quantify the relation between the returns on GE stock and the market by finding the slope of the line that best represents the relation illustrated in Exhibit 7.9. Specifically, we estimate the slope of the line of best fit. We do this using the statistical technique called regression analysis. If you are not familiar with regression analysis, don’t worry; the details are beyond the scope of this course. All you have to know is that this technique gives us the line that fits the data best.

Exhibit 7.10 illustrates the line that was estimated for the data in Exhibit 7.9 using regression analysis. Note that the slope of this line is 0.93. Recall from your math classes that the slope of a line equals the ratio of the rise (vertical distance) divided by the corresponding run (horizontal distance). In this case, the slope is the change in the return on GE stock divided by the change in the return on the U.S. stock market. A slope of 0.93 therefore means that, on average, the change in the return on GE stock was 0.93 times as large as the change in the return on the S&P 500 Index. Thus, if the S&P 500 Index goes up 1 percent, the average increase in GE’s stock is 0.93 percent. This is a measure of systematic risk because it tells us that the volatility of the returns on GE stock is 0.93 times as large as that for the S&P 500 as a whole.

To explore this idea more completely, let’s consider another, simpler example. Suppose that you have data for Nike stock and for the U.S. stock market (S&P 500 Index) for each of the past two years. In the first year, the return on the market was 10 percent, and the return on Nike stock was 15 percent. In the second year, the return on the market was 12 percent, and the return on Nike stock was 19 percent. From this information, we know that the return on Nike stock increased by 4 percent while the return on the market increased 2 percent. If we plotted the returns for Nike stock and for the market for each of the last two periods, as we did for GE stock and the market in Exhibits 7.9 and 7.10, and estimated the line that best fit the data, it would be a line that connected the dots for the two periods. The slope of this line would equal 2, calculated as follows:

EXHIBIT 7.10 Slope of Relation between General Electric Company Monthly Stock Returns and S&P 500 Index Returns: September 2015 through September 2020 The line shown in the exhibit best represents the relation between the monthly returns on General Electric stock and the returns on the S&P 500 Index. The slope of this line, which equals 0.93, indicates that the return on General Electric stock tends to equal about 0.93 times the return on the S&P 500 Index.


Although we have to be careful about drawing conclusions when we have only two data points, we might interpret the slope of 2 to indicate that new information that causes the market return to increase by 1 percent will tend to cause the return on Nike stock to increase by 2 percent. Of course, the reverse might also be true. That is, new information that causes the market return to decrease by 1 percent may also cause the return on Nike stock to go down by 2 percent. To the extent that the same information is driving the changes in returns on Nike stock and on the market, it would not be possible for an investor in Nike stock to diversify this risk away. It is nondiversifiable, or systematic, risk.

In finance, we call the slope of the line of best fit beta. Often we simply use the corresponding Greek letter, β, to refer to this measure of systematic risk. As shown below, a beta of 1 tells us that an asset has just as much systematic risk as the market. A beta higher than or lower than 1 tells us that the asset has more or less systematic risk than the market, respectively. A beta of 0 indicates a risk-free security, such as a U.S. Treasury bill.

beta (β) a measure of nondiversifiable, systematic (or market) risk

Now you might ask yourself what happened to the unsystematic risk of GE or Nike stock. This is best illustrated by the GE example, where we have more than two return observations. As you can see in Exhibit 7.10, the line of best fit does not go through each data point. That is because some of the change in GE’s stock price each month reflected information that did not affect the S&P 500 as a whole. That information is the unsystematic component of the risk of GE’s stock. The vertical distance between each data point and the line of best fit represents variation in GE’s stock return that can be attributed to this unsystematic risk.

The positive slope (β) of the regression line in Exhibit 7.10 tells us that returns for the S&P 500 and for GE stock will tend to move in the same direction. The return on the S&P 500 and the return on GE’s stock will not always change in the same direction, however, because the unsystematic risk associated with GE stock can more than offset the effect of the market in any particular period. In the next section, we will discuss the implications of beta for the level (as opposed to the change) in the expected return for a stock such as GE.

Compensation for Bearing Systematic Risk
Now that we have identified the measure of the risk that diversified investors care about—systematic risk—we are in a position to examine how this measure relates to expected returns. Earlier, in our discussion of the coefficient of variation and the Sharpe Ratio, we asserted that the expected return over and above the risk-free rate is the return that investors expect to earn for bearing risk. To see why this must be true, think about the rate of return that you would require for an investment. First, you would want to make sure that you were compensated for inflation. It would not make sense to invest if you expected the investment to return an amount that did not at least allow you to have the same purchasing power that the money you invested had when you made the investment. Second, you would want some compensation for the fact that you are giving up the use of your money for a period of time. This compensation may be very small if you are forgoing the use of your money for only a short time, such as when you invest in a 30-day Treasury bill, but it might be relatively large if you are investing for several years. Finally, you would also require compensation for the systematic risk associated with the investment.

When you invest in a U.S. government security such as a Treasury bill, note, or bond, you are investing in a security that has no risk of default. After all, the U.S. government can always increase taxes or print more money to pay you back. Changes in economic conditions and other factors that affect the returns on other assets do not affect the default risk of U.S. government securities. As a result, these securities do not have systematic risk, and their returns can be viewed as risk free. In other words, returns on government bonds reflect the compensation required by investors to account for the impact of inflation on purchasing power and for their inability to use the money during the life of the investment.

It follows that the difference between required returns on government securities and required returns for risky investments represents the compensation investors require for taking risk. Recognizing this allows us to write the expected return for an asset i as:

where Rrf is the return on a security with a risk-free rate of return, which analysts typically estimate by looking at returns on government securities. The compensation for taking risk, which varies with the risk of the asset, is added to the risk-free rate of return to get an estimate of the expected rate of return for an asset. If we recognize that the compensation for taking risk varies with asset risk and that systematic risk is what matters, we can write the preceding equation as follows:

where units of systematic riski is the number of units of systematic risk associated with asset i. Finally, if beta, β, is the appropriate measure for the number of units of systematic risk, we can also define compensation for taking risk as follows:

where βi is the beta for asset i.

Remember that beta is a measure of systematic risk that is directly related to the risk of the market as a whole. If the beta for an asset is 2, that asset has twice as much systematic risk as the market. If the beta for an asset is 0.5, then the asset has half as much systematic risk as the market. Recognizing this natural interpretation of beta suggests that the appropriate “unit of systematic risk” is the level of risk in the market as a whole and that the appropriate “compensation per unit of systematic risk” is the expected return required for the level of systematic risk in the market as a whole. The required rate of return on the market, over and above that of the risk-free return, represents compensation required by investors for bearing market (systematic) risk. This suggests that:

where E(Rm) is the expected return on the market. The term E(Rm) − Rrf is called the market risk premium. Consequently, we can now write the equation for expected return as:

7.8 The Capital Asset Pricing Model
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe what the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) tells us and how to use it to evaluate whether the expected return of an asset is sufficient to compensate an investor for the risks associated with that asset.
In deriving Equation 7.12, we intuitively arrived at the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Equation 7.12 is the CAPM, a model that describes the relation between risk and expected return. We will discuss the predictions of the CAPM in more detail shortly, but first let’s look more closely at how it works.

Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) a model that describes the relation between risk and expected return

Suppose that you want to estimate the expected return for a stock that has a beta of 1.5 and that the expected return on the market and risk-free rate are 10 percent and 4 percent, respectively. We can use Equation 7.12 (the CAPM) to find the expected return for this stock:

Note that we must have three pieces of information in order to use Equation 7.12: (1) the risk-free rate, (2) beta, and (3) either the market risk premium or the expected return on the market. Recall that the market risk premium is the difference between the expected return on the market and the risk-free rate [E(Rm) − Rrf], which is 6 percent in the above example.

While the expected return on the market is known in the above example, we actually cannot observe it in practice. For this reason, financial analysts estimate the market risk premium using historical data. We discuss how they do this in Chapter 13.

The Security Market Line
Exhibit 7.11 displays a plot of Equation 7.12 to illustrate how the expected return on an asset varies with systematic risk. This plot shows that the relation between the expected return on an asset and beta is positive and linear. In other words, it is a straight line with a positive slope. The line in Exhibit 7.11 is known as the Security Market Line (SML).

Security Market Line (SML) a plot of the relation between expected return and systematic risk

In Exhibit 7.11, you can see that the expected rate of return equals the risk-free rate when beta equals 0. This makes sense because when investors do not face systematic risk, they will only require a return that reflects the expected rate of inflation and the fact that they are giving up the use of their money for a period of time. Exhibit 7.11 also shows that the expected return on an asset equals the expected return on the market when beta equals 1. This is not surprising given that both the asset and the market would have the same level of systematic risk if this were the case.

It is important to recognize that the SML illustrates what the CAPM predicts the expected total return should be for various values of beta. The actual expected total return depends on the price of the asset. You can see this from Equation 7.1:

where P0 is the price that the asset is currently selling for. If an asset’s price implies that the expected return is greater than that predicted by the CAPM, that asset will plot above the SML in Exhibit 7.11. This means that the asset’s price is lower than the CAPM suggests it should be. Conversely, if the expected return on an asset plots below the SML, this implies that the asset’s price is higher than the CAPM suggests it should be. The point at which a particular asset plots relative to the SML, then, tells us something about whether the price of that asset might be low or high. Recognizing this fact can be helpful in evaluating the attractiveness of an investment such as the General Electric stock in Learning by Doing Application 7.7.

Decision Making Example 7.2 further illustrates application of the concepts discussed in this section to the selection of investments.

EXHIBIT 7.11 The Security Market Line The Security Market Line (SML) is the line that shows the relation between expected return and systematic risk, as measured by beta. When beta equals 0 and there is no systematic risk, the expected return equals the risk-free rate. As systematic risk (beta) increases, the expected return increases. This is an illustration of the positive relation between risk and return. The SML shows that it is systematic risk that matters to investors.


LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 7.7
Expected Returns and Systematic Risk

Problem

You are considering buying 100 shares of General Electric stock. The Yahoo! Finance Web site reports that the beta for General Electric is 0.93. The risk-free rate is 4 percent, and the market risk premium is 6 percent. What is the expected rate of return on General Electric stock according to the CAPM?





DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 7.2
Choosing between Two Investments

Situation

You are trying to decide whether to invest in one or both of two different stocks. Stock 1 has a beta of 0.8 and, based on its current price, has an expected return of 7.0 percent. Stock 2 has a beta of 1.2 and, based on its current price, has an expected return of 9.5 percent. You remember learning about the CAPM in school and believe that it does a good job of telling you what the appropriate expected return should be for a given level of risk. Since the risk-free rate is 4 percent and the market risk premium is 6 percent, the CAPM tells you that the appropriate expected rate of return for an asset with a beta of 0.8 is 8.8 percent. The corresponding return for an asset with a beta of 1.2 is 11.2 percent. Should you invest in either or both of these stocks?



The Capital Asset Pricing Model and Portfolio Returns
The expected return for a portfolio can also be estimated using the CAPM. The expected return on a portfolio with n assets is calculated using the relation:

Of course, this should not be surprising, since investing in a portfolio is simply an alternative to investing in a single asset.

The fact that the SML is a straight line turns out to be rather convenient if we want to estimate the beta for a portfolio. Recall that the equation for the expected return for a portfolio with n assets was given by Equation 7.8:

If we substitute Equation 7.12 into Equation 7.8 for each of the n assets and rearrange the equation, we find that the beta for a portfolio is simply a weighted average of the betas for the individual assets in the portfolio. In other words:

(7.13)
where xi is the proportion of the portfolio value that is invested in asset i, βi is the beta of asset i, and n is the number of assets in the portfolio. This formula makes it simple to calculate the beta of any portfolio of assets once you know the betas of the individual assets. As an exercise, you might prove this to yourself by using Equations 7.8 and 7.12 to derive Equation 7.13.

Let’s consider an example to see how Equation 7.13 is used. Suppose that you invested 25 percent of your wealth in a fully diversified market fund, 25 percent in risk-free Treasury bills, and 50 percent in a house with twice as much systematic risk as the market. What is the beta of your overall portfolio? What rate of return would you expect to earn from this portfolio if the risk-free rate is 4 percent and the market risk premium is 6 percent?

We know that the beta for the market must equal 1 by definition and that the beta for a risk-free asset equals 0. The beta for your home must be 2 since it has twice the systematic risk of the market. Therefore, the beta of your portfolio is:

Your portfolio has 1.25 times as much systematic risk as the market. Based on Equation 7.12, you would, therefore, expect to earn a return of 11.5 percent, calculated as follows:

Learning by Doing Application 7.8 illustrates another calculation of the expected return for a portfolio.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 7.8
Portfolio Risk and Expected Return

Problem

You have recently become very interested in real estate. To gain some experience as a real estate investor, you have decided to get together with nine of your friends to buy three small cottages near campus. If you and your friends pool your money, you will have just enough to buy the three properties. Since each investment requires the same amount of money and you will have a 10 percent interest in each, you will effectively have one-third of your portfolio invested in each cottage.

While the cottages cost the same, they are different distances from campus and in different neighborhoods. You believe that this causes them to have different levels of systematic risk, and you estimate that the betas for the individual cottages are 1.2, 1.3, and 1.5. If the risk-free rate is 4 percent and the market risk premium is 6 percent, what will be the expected return on your real estate portfolio after you make all three investments?





Up to this point, we have focused on calculating the expected rate of return for an investment in any asset from the perspective of an investor, such as a stockholder. A natural question that might arise is how these concepts relate to the rate of return that should be used within a firm to evaluate a project. The short answer is that they are the same. The rate of return used to discount the cash flows for a project with a particular level of systematic risk is exactly the same as the rate of return that an investor would expect to receive from an investment in any asset having the same level of systematic risk. In Chapter 13 we will explore the relation between the expected return and the rate used to discount project cash flows in much more detail. By the time we finish that discussion, you will understand thoroughly how businesses determine the rate that they use to discount the cash flows from their investments.

If an asset’s expected return does not plot on the line in question 2 above, what does that imply about its price?
Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Explain the relation between risk and return.

Investors require higher returns for taking greater risk. They prefer the investment with the highest possible return for a given level of risk or the investment with the lowest risk for a given level of return.

2 Describe the two components of a total holding period return, and calculate this return for an asset.

The total holding period return on an investment consists of a capital appreciation component and an income component. This return is calculated using Equation 7.1. It is important to recognize that investors do not care whether they receive a dollar of return through capital appreciation or as a cash dividend. Investors value both sources of return equally.

3 Explain what an expected return is, and calculate the expected return for an asset.

The expected return is a weighted average of the possible returns from an investment, where each of these returns is weighted by the probability that it will occur. It is calculated using Equation 7.2.

4 Explain what the standard deviation of returns is and why it is very useful in finance, and calculate it for an asset.

The standard deviation of returns is a measure of the total risk associated with the returns from an asset. It is useful in evaluating returns in finance because the returns on many assets tend to be normally distributed. The standard deviation of returns provides a convenient measure of the dispersion of returns. In other words, it tells us about the probability that a return will fall within a particular distance from the expected value or within a particular range. To calculate the standard deviation, the variance is first calculated using Equation 7.3. The standard deviation of returns is then calculated by taking the square root of the variance.

5 Explain what an arithmetic average return is and what a geometric average return is, and calculate these returns for an asset.

The arithmetic average return is the return earned in an average period, while the geometric average return is the average compounded return earned by an investor. Equations 7.4 and 7.5 are used to calculate these returns.

6 Explain the concept of diversification and its effect on risk.

Diversification entails reducing risk by investing in two or more assets whose returns do not always move in the same direction at the same time. Investing in a portfolio containing assets whose prices do not always move together reduces risk because some of the changes in the prices of individual assets offset each other. This can cause the overall variance in the returns of an investor’s portfolio to be lower than if it consisted of only a single asset.

7 Discuss why systematic risk matters to investors and how this measure relates to expected returns.

Investors care about only systematic risk. This is because they can eliminate unsystematic risk by holding a diversified portfolio. Diversified investors will bid up prices for assets to the point at which they are just being compensated for the systematic risks they must bear. Expected returns increase with the systematic risk of an asset. Government securities do not have systematic risk, since there is no risk of default. The difference between the required returns on government securities, measured by the risk-free rate of return, and required returns for risky assets, represents the compensation investors require for taking on systematic risk.

8 Describe what the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) tells us and how to use it to evaluate whether the expected return of an asset is sufficient to compensate an investor for the risks associated with that asset.

The CAPM tells us that the relation between systematic risk and return is linear and that the risk-free rate of return is the appropriate return for an asset with no systematic risk. From the CAPM, we know what rate of return investors will require for an investment with a particular amount of systematic risk (beta). This means that we can use the expected return predicted by the CAPM as a benchmark for evaluating whether expected returns for individual assets are sufficient. If the expected return for an asset is less than that predicted by the CAPM, then the asset is an unattractive investment because its expected return is lower than the CAPM indicates it should be. By the same token, if the expected return for an asset is greater than that predicted by the CAPM, then the asset is an attractive investment because its return is higher than it should be.

In other words, both are equally attractive investments for a diversified investor. However, since you are still in school and do not have a lot of money, your investment portfolio is not diversified. You have decided to invest in the stock that has the highest expected return per unit of total risk. If the expected return and standard deviation of returns for Stock A are 10 percent and 25 percent, respectively, and the expected return and standard deviation of returns for Stock B are 15 percent and 40 percent, respectively, which should you choose? Assume that the risk-free rate is 5 percent.



7.6 Viatris, Inc., stock has a beta of 1.35. If the expected market return is 14.5 percent and the risk-free rate is 5.5 percent, what does CAPM indicate the appropriate expected return for Viatris stock is?



Discussion Questions
7.1 Suppose that you know the risk and the expected return for two stocks. Discuss the process you might utilize to determine which of the two stocks is a better buy. You may assume that the two stocks will be the only assets held in your portfolio.

7.2 What is the difference between the expected rate of return and the required rate of return? What does it mean if they are different for a particular asset at a particular point in time?

7.3 Suppose that the standard deviation of the returns on the shares of stock at two different companies is exactly the same. Does this mean that the required rate of return will be the same for these two stocks? How might the required rate of return on the stock of a third company be greater than the required rates of return on the stocks of the first two companies even if the standard deviation of the returns of the third company’s stock is lower?

7.4 The correlation between Stocks A and B is 0.50, while the correlation between Stocks A and C is −0.5. You already own Stock A and are thinking of buying either Stock B or Stock C. If you want your portfolio to have the lowest possible risk, would you buy Stock B or C? Would you expect the stock you choose to affect the return that you earn on your portfolio?

7.5 The idea that we can know the return on a security for each possible outcome is overly simplistic. However, even though we cannot possibly predict all possible outcomes, this fact has little bearing on the risk-free return. Explain why.

7.6 Which investment category included in Exhibit 7.3 has shown the greatest degree of risk in the United States since 1926? Explain why that makes sense in a world where the value of an asset in this investment category is likely to be more sensitive to changes in market conditions than is the price of a corporate bond.

7.7 You are concerned about one of the investments in your fully diversified portfolio. You just have an uneasy feeling about the CFO, Iam Shifty, of that particular firm. You do believe, however, that the firm makes a good product and that it is appropriately priced by the market. Should you be concerned about the effect on your portfolio if Shifty embezzles a portion of the firm’s cash?

7.8 The CAPM is used to price the risk (estimate the expected return) for any asset. Our examples have focused on stocks, but we could also use CAPM to estimate the expected rate of return for bonds. Explain why.

7.9 In recent years, investors have agreed that the market portfolio consists of more than just a group of U.S. stocks and bonds. If you are an investor who invests in only U.S. stocks and bonds, describe the effects on the risk in your portfolio.

7.10 You may have heard the statement that you should not include your home as an asset in your investment portfolio. Assume that your house will comprise up to 75 percent of your assets in the early part of your investment life. Evaluate the implications of omitting it when calculating the risk of your overall investment portfolio.

She knows that the return on the utility stock has a standard deviation of 40 percent and the return on the commodity stock has a standard deviation of 30 percent. However, she does not know the exact covariance of the returns of the two stocks. Emmy would like to plot the variance of the portfolio for each of three cases—covariance of 0.12, 0, and −0.12—in order to understand what the variance of the portfolio would be for a range of covariances. Do the calculation for all three cases (0.12, 0, and −0.12), assuming an equal proportion of each stock in the portfolio.

7.22 Portfolios with more than one asset: Given the returns and probabilities for the three possible states listed below, calculate the covariance between the returns of Stock A and Stock B.

7.34 Brad is about to purchase an additional asset for his well-diversified portfolio. He notices that when he plots the historical returns of the asset against those of the market portfolio, the line of best fit tends to have a large amount of prediction error for each data point (the scatter plot is not very tight around the line of best fit). Do you think that this will have a large or a small impact on the beta of the asset? Explain your opinion.

Ethics Case
Pay for Performance or Just More Pay? The Conflicting Case for CEO Pay

Few issues in corporate America today garner as much attention as the pay of public company CEOs. As discussed in Chapter 1 of this textbook, management compensation can be the most effective means of aligning the interests of managers with those of their stockholders when executive pay is linked to company performance. Thus, most incentive plans include a base salary as well as performance bonuses and stock-based compensation such as stock options and stock grants. While the right mix of these elements can provide strong incentives for managerial performance, many corporate governance experts and shareholder groups have expressed alarm at the sharp rise in CEO pay that may not adequately reflect the performance of their corporations. In a recent example, Abigail Disney, great-niece of the company’s co-founder Walt Disney, criticized the $65 million pay package of then CEO Bob Iger as “insane” stating that “No one on this freaking planet is worth that much money.”

The CEOs of large corporations today are some of the top paid individuals on the globe. Many CEOs earn vastly more than the well-publicized earnings paid to top professional athletes and entertainment stars. For example, in 2020 the highest paid NBA player, LeBron James, earned approximated $96.5 million in salary, endorsements and other investments. While a vast sum by any standard, LeBron’s income was less than half of the $211 million earned by Paycom CEO Chad Richison, and only one tenth of the record 2020 payout of $1.1 billion to Alexander Karp, the CEO of Palantir Technologies.1

While the executive payouts at Paycom and Palantir are outliers, the median pay package for the CEOs of some of the largest U.S. public companies was a generous $13.7 million, up from the median pay package of $12.8 million for the same companies just one year before. This increase was remarkable given the vast negative impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on many aspects of business around the world. This latest increase in pay is just part of a longer trend in which CEO compensation nearly doubled for CEOs of S&P 500 companies over the course of the last decade and increased over 1,000 percent over the last three decades!2,3

Critics of CEO pay packages are quick to point out that these company leaders earn vastly more that their own rank and file employees, contributing to the growing trend in income inequality. Data compiled by Equilar and The New York Times show that the gap in earnings has accelerated as rapidly as the level of CEO pay. In 1989, the CEOs of the largest U.S. corporations earned approximately 61 times the average worker in their companies, but by 2019, that number had ballooned to almost 300 times.4


How Do Boards of Directors Set CEO Pay

With such astronomical pay packages, it is natural to question how CEO compensation is determined. From the standpoint of shareholders, hiring a CEO is an important investment for the company. As with any other investment, corporate boards should pay CEOs based on the value they will create for the company, however, this figure can be very difficult to estimate. One of the most important approaches in setting CEO pay is to determine what other “peer” companies pay their CEOs. Compensation Committees of boards typically hire outside compensation consultants who benchmark CEO pay against a carefully selected peer group that consists of a dozen or more companies that are similar in size and have comparable business models. While the CEO pay at company peers provides a reasonable benchmark, critics of this process have noted a potential pitfall to this approach, noting that corporate directors may be favorably biased in assessing the skills and performance of their own CEO. This bias can cause members of the compensation committee to set their CEO pay at the high end of the peer group. And when committees increase CEO pay, that, in turn, drives other companies to pay their CEOs more because peer group norms go up. This so called “ratchet” effect is one explanation for the sharp increase in CEO pay over time.


Linking CEO Pay to Company Performance

Designing a CEO pay package that is sensitive to company performance is important for the shareholders and other corporate stakeholders. When a company’s board of directors create these incentives, CEOs are more likely to focus on taking actions that maximize the value of the company, because doing so maximizes their pay. Performance-based pay takes several forms including bonuses tied to accounting performance and other important outcomes, as well as stock-based pay such as restricted stock, performance shares, and stock option grants.

Restricted stock is stock awarded to a CEO with a specific vesting schedule for when in the future the CEO can expect to fully own the shares. Consider a CEO who receives 10,000 shares of restricted stock in their company that vests in two years with a per share price of $20 per share. The value of the restricted stock awarded to the executive is $200,000. If, however, the CEO is able to make investment and other decisions that increase the price per share to $30 over the next two years, her stock award will be worth $300,000 when it vests, a $100,000 gain! After vesting, the CEO can sell some or all of her stock to realize the gains attributable to her performance.

If instead, the CEO receives 10,000 performance shares, she will need to meet a specific performance target(s) to take actual ownership of the shares. These targets can include traditional financial metrics such as earnings and return on assets, but may also include more specific goals set by company directors, for example diversity and sustainability outcomes. Finally, stock options awards grant executives the right to buy shares in their company stock at a predetermined price that is above the current market price. Much like restricted stock and performance shares, executive stock options vest over time and become more valuable when executives take actions that cause an appreciation in the stock price.

Critics of stock-based pay today argue that the incentive awards have become simply too large, and do not include stringent enough performance hurdles. Today, stock awards comprise more than 50 percent of the total pay awarded to CEOs of S&P 500 companies. In the extreme case of Palantir Technologies, the bulk of Alexander Karp’s 2020 pay consisted of options worth approximately $800 million, with another $300 million in stock awards. This stock-based compensation vastly outweighed his roughly $1.5 million in cash compensation in the same year. For some perspective, the $1.1 billion pay package of Mr. Karp was equivalent to the total revenue of Palantir in 2020, making it difficult to understand how it could be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders or other stakeholders.

Additional concerns focus on the performance targets associated with stock-based compensation. For example, incentives tied to stock prices can reward CEOs for luck rather than their effort if a company’s stock price rises due simply to macroeconomic factors such as the business cycle, or industry wide gains. Critics have also noted that performance targets can be gamed by CEOs who can manipulate investment and other company decisions to boost earnings up, and are wary that boards of directors may set performance conditions that are not sufficiently tough to meet.

Do Shareholders Have a Say on Pay?

Most large public companies in the U.S. are now required to provide shareholders with an annual vote on CEO compensation under the SEC’s Say-on-Pay rule. While Say-on-Pay votes are non-binding and do not require a response by the board of directors, they do provide shareholders, particularly institutional investors, with a voice in the process of setting CEO pay. Since the inception of the 2010 federal Say-on-Pay legislation, only about 2 percent of Say-on-Pay votes failed to garner a majority of shareholder approval. However, a number of high-profile shareholder rejections, including the 2021 resolution at Starbucks, have caused some boards to reconsider how they set CEO pay.5

Discussion Questions
Do CEOs make too much money? If you were a corporate director, how would you suggest your company determine the pay of the CEO? Do CEOs make too much money relative to their average worker?
Should companies focus exclusively on performance targets for CEO pay that are related to stockholder value such as return on equity and per share earnings, or should they include broader targets such as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals?
Do you think that Say-on-Pay votes should be binding, and therefore require a response by boards of directors if pay proposals fail to receive a majority of shareholder approval?
Notes
1 For simplicity, let’s ignore the possibility of your hitting a sacrifice fly and other such outcomes.
2 From a practical standpoint, it would not really have been possible to grow $1.00 to $39,381.93 by investing in small U.S. stocks because this increase assumes that an investor is able to rebalance the stock portfolio by buying and selling shares as necessary at no cost. Since buying and selling shares is costly, the final wealth would have been lower. Nevertheless, even after transaction costs, it would have been much more profitable to invest in small stocks than in U.S. Treasury bills.
3 On August 5, 2011, Standard and Poor’s, the credit rating agency, lowered its rating on U.S. Treasury securities from AAA to AA+, indicating that it considered these securities to have a very small amount of default risk. The other two large credit rating agencies, Moody’s and Fitch, decided not to lower their ratings of U.S. Treasury securities at that time, suggesting that if there was any default risk, it remained extremely small. The agencies have not subsequently changed their ratings on U.S. Treasury securities.

5 The only adjustment that we had to make was to account for the fact that our calculations used monthly returns rather than annual returns. This adjustment simply required us to multiply each number we calculated by 12 because there are 12 months in a year.
6 You can see this by using Equation 7.11 to solve for , substituting for in Equation 7.9, and then solving for by using algebra to solve for the square root of .
7 This statement is true in the context of how expected returns are determined. However, the standard deviation is still a very useful measure of the risk faced by an individual investor who does not hold a diversified portfolio. For example, the owners of most small businesses have much of their personal wealth tied up in their businesses. They are certainly concerned about the total risk because it is directly related to the probability that they will go out of business and lose much of their wealth.

CHAPTER 8
Bond Valuation and the Structure of Interest Rates
CHAPTER 8
Bond Valuation and the Structure of Interest Rates

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Describe the market for corporate bonds and three types of corporate bonds.
Explain how to calculate the value of a bond and why bond prices vary negatively with interest rate movements.
Distinguish between a bond’s coupon rate, yield to maturity, and effective annual yield.
Explain why investors in bonds are subject to interest rate risk and why it is important to understand the bond theorems.
Discuss the concept of default risk and know how to compute a default risk premium.
Describe the factors that determine the level and shape of the yield curve.
On May 22, 2020, the car rental company Hertz filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection from its creditors. A large portion of Hertz’s revenue comes from car rentals at airports around the world, and this source of revenue all but evaporated with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. It quickly became impossible for the firm to make all of the required payments on its nearly $20 billion in outstanding debt.

Hertz’s dire financial situation was compounded by the fact that much of its debt load was made up of securitized debt, obligations with payments tied to the value of its fleet of rental cars. As the global health crisis worsened, a decline in the market value of used vehicles increased Hertz’s monthly payments to these secured creditors. Management attempted to negotiate with the firm’s creditors to obtain some temporary relief, and proposed selling as many as 30,000 vehicles a month from the company’s fleet of over 500,000 cars in an effort to improve cash flows. Ultimately, these efforts were unsuccessful, prompting management to voluntarily declare bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code.

Chapter 11 is the part of the bankruptcy code that companies can use to restructure operations and debts when the debts are so large that the company cannot reasonably expect to pay them in full. In a situation such as that faced by Hertz, a debt restructuring involves developing a plan that repays the creditors as much as possible while allowing the company to continue its operations. Many creditors in a restructuring are forced to “forgive” some of the value they are owed so that the company has the necessary breathing room to continue to function.

The value of all of Hertz’s bonds fell when investors realized that a bankruptcy filing was likely. Publicly traded bonds for Hertz were selling for as little as 11 cents per dollar on the date of the May 2020 bankruptcy declaration, a nearly 90 percent decline in value from their price just three months earlier. The firm’s bond values fell because the prices that investors pay for bonds reflect the value of the interest and principal payments that ownership of those debts entitles them to receive. When a debt issuer gets into financial difficulty, investors are less likely to receive the interest and principal payments that they have been promised, and so they place less value on them. Specifically, investors require higher rates of return for riskier debts. As you might recall from Chapters 5 and 6, when required rates of return go up, the present value of future cash flows, such as interest and principal payments, goes down. The weaker the security underlying the interest and principal payments from a debt, the more the interest rates increase. This chapter discusses the characteristics of bonds, a common form of debt financing used by businesses. It also explains how bonds are valued and identifies the factors that determine bond prices and yields.

Chapter Preview
This chapter is all about debt that firms issue as bonds and how bonds are valued, or priced, in the marketplace. As you might suspect, the bond valuation models presented in this chapter are derived from the present value concepts discussed in Chapters 5 and 6. The market price of a bond is simply the present value of the promised cash flows (interest and principal payments), discounted at the current market rate of interest for bonds of similar risk.

In this chapter we first discuss the corporate bond market, bond price information that is available, and the types of bonds found in the market. Then we develop the basic equation used to calculate bond prices and show how to compute the following characteristics of a bond: (1) yield to maturity and (2) effective annual yield. We next discuss interest rate risk and identify three bond theorems that describe how bond prices respond to changes in interest rates. Finally, we explain why firms have different borrowing costs. We find that four factors affect a firm’s cost of borrowing: (1) the debt’s marketability, (2) default risk, (3) call risk, and (4) term to maturity.

8.1 Corporate Bonds
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the market for corporate bonds and three types of corporate bonds.
In this section we discuss the market for corporate bonds and some of the types of bonds that firms issue.


Market for Corporate Bonds
The market for corporate bonds is enormous. At the end of the third quarter of 2020, for example, the value of corporate debt outstanding for nonfinancial firms in the United States was $16.9 trillion, almost 79 percent as large as the total U.S. gross domestic product in 2019 of $21.44 trillion. By comparison, the market for corporate equity was the largest part of the U.S. capital market, with a value of $36.3 trillion, and U.S. government Treasury bills and bonds totaled $19 trillion. State and local government debt markets were much smaller at $4.2 trillion. The most important investors in corporate bonds are large institutional investors such as life insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds. Because the primary investors are so big, trades in this market tend to involve very large blocks of securities.

Most secondary market transactions for corporate bonds take place through dealers in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. An interesting characteristic of the corporate bond market is the large number of different bond issues that trade in the market. The reason is that while a corporation typically has a single issue of common stock outstanding, it may have a dozen or more different notes and bonds outstanding. Therefore, despite the large overall trading volume of corporate bonds, the bonds from any particular issue will not necessarily trade on a given day. As a result, the market for corporate bonds is thin compared to the market for corporate stocks or money market securities. On Wall Street, the term thin means that secondary market trades of individual securities are relatively infrequent. Thus, corporate bonds are less marketable than the securities that have higher daily trading volumes, like stocks or U.S. Treasury securities.

Prices in the corporate bond market also tend to be more volatile than prices of securities sold in markets with greater trading volumes. This is because a few large trades can have a larger impact on a security’s price than numerous trades of various sizes. The result is that the market for corporate bonds is not as efficient (new information does not get incorporated into corporate bond prices as efficiently) as those for highly marketable securities, such as stocks or U.S. Treasury bills and bonds.

Bond Price Information
The corporate bond market also has little transparency because it is almost entirely an OTC market. A financial market is transparent if it is easy to view prices and trading volume. An example of a transparent market is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), where price information on every trade and trade size is available for every transaction during the day. In contrast, corporate bond market transactions are widely dispersed, with dealers located all over the country, and there is an enormous number of different securities. While trade prices are available for some debt securities, many corporate bond transactions are negotiated directly between the buyer and the seller, and there is limited centralized reporting of these sales. As a result, information on individual corporate bond transactions is not widely published as the transactions occur. This is another reason that the corporate bond market is not as efficient as the stock or money markets.

Types of Corporate Bonds
Corporate bonds are long-term IOUs that represent claims against a firm’s assets. Unlike stockholders’ returns, most bondholders’ returns are fixed; they receive only the interest payments that are promised plus the repayment of the loan amount when the bond matures. Debt instruments where the interest paid to investors is fixed for the life of the contract are called fixed-income securities. We examine three types of fixed-income securities in this section.

fixed-income securities debt instruments that pay interest in amounts that are fixed for the life of the contract

Vanilla Bonds

The most common bonds issued by corporations have coupon payments that are fixed for the life of the bond, and at maturity the entire original principal is paid and the bonds are retired. These bonds are known as vanilla bonds if they have no special characteristics, such as a conversion feature (discussed below).


The time line above shows the cash payments for a three-year vanilla bond with a $1,000 face value and an 8 percent coupon (interest) rate. PB is the price (value) of the bond, which will be discussed in the next section. The $80 cash payments ($1,000 × 8 percent = $80) made each year are called the coupon payments. Coupon payments are the interest payments made to bondholders. These payments are usually made annually or semiannually, and the payment amount (or rate) remains fixed for the life of the bond contract, which for our example is three years. The face value, or par value, for most corporate bonds is $1,000, and it is the principal amount owed to the bondholder at maturity. Finally, the bond’s coupon rate is the annual coupon payment (C) divided by the bond’s face value (F). Our vanilla bond pays $80 of coupon interest annually and has a face value of $1,000. The coupon rate is thus:

coupon payments the interest payments made to bondholders

face value, or par value the amount on which interest is calculated and that is owed to the bondholder when a bond reaches maturity

coupon rate the annual coupon payment of a bond divided by the bond’s face value

Zero Coupon Bonds

Some bonds have no coupon payments but promise a single payment at maturity. The interest paid to a bondholder is the difference between the price paid for the bond and the face value received at maturity. These bonds are sold at a price below the amount that the investor receives at maturity because all of the interest is paid when the bonds are retired at maturity rather than in semiannual or yearly coupon payments. The face value of a zero coupon bond is different from that of a vanilla bond in that it includes both the interest and the principal.

The most frequent and regular issuer of zero coupon bonds is the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and perhaps the best-known zero coupon security is a United States Saving Bond. Corporations also issue zero coupon bonds from time to time. Firms that are expanding operations but have little cash available to make interest payments are especially likely to use zero coupon bonds for funding. In the 1990s, the bond market was flooded with zero coupon bonds issued by telecommunications firms. These firms were spending huge amounts to build fiber-optic networks, which generated few cash inflows until they were completed.

Convertible Bonds

Corporate convertible bonds can be converted into shares of common stock at some predetermined ratio at the discretion of the bondholder. For example, a $1,000 face-value bond may be convertible into 100 shares of common stock. A conversion feature is valuable to bondholders because it allows them to share in the good fortunes of the firm if the firm’s stock price rises above a certain level. Specifically, the bondholders profit if they exchange their bonds for the company’s stock when the market value of the stock they receive exceeds the market value of the bonds.

Typically, the conversion ratio is set so that the firm’s stock price must appreciate at least 15 to 20 percent before it is profitable to convert the bonds into stock. As you would expect from our discussion, since a conversion feature is valuable to bondholders, firms that issue convertible bonds can do so at a lower interest rate. This reduces the amount of cash that the firms must use to make interest payments.

8.2 Bond Valuation
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain how to calculate the value of a bond and why bond prices vary negatively with interest rate movements.
We turn now to the topic of bond valuation—how bonds are priced. Throughout this book, we have stressed that the value, or price, of any asset is the present value of its future cash flows. The steps necessary to value an asset are as follows:

Estimate the expected future cash flows.
Determine the required rate of return, or discount rate. This rate depends on the riskiness of the future cash flowsd.
Compute the present value of the future cash flows. This present value is what the asset is worth at a particular point in time.
For bonds, the valuation procedure is relatively easy. The cash flows (coupon and principal payments) are contractual obligations of the firm and are known by market participants, since they are stated in the bond contract. Thus, market participants know the magnitude and timing of the expected cash flows as promised by the borrower (the bond issuer). The required rate of return, or discount rate, for a bond is the market interest rate, called the bond’s yield to maturity (or more commonly, simply its yield). This rate is determined from the market prices of bonds that have features similar to those of the bond being valued; by similar, we mean bonds that have the same term to maturity, have the same bond rating (default risk class), and are similar in other ways.

Notice that the required rate of return is the opportunity cost for the investors who purchase the bond. An opportunity cost is the highest alternative return that is given up when an investment is made. For example, if bonds identical to the bond being valued—having the same risk—yield 9 percent annually, the threshold yield or required return on the bond being valued is 9 percent. Why? An investor would not buy a bond with an 8 percent yield when an identical bond yielding 9 percent is available.

opportunity cost the return from the best alternative investment with similar risk that an investor gives up when he or she makes a certain investment

Given the above information, we can compute the current value, or price, of a bond (PB) by calculating the present value of the bond’s expected cash flows:

Next, we examine this calculation in detail.

The Bond Valuation Formula
To begin, refer to Exhibit 8.1, which shows the cash flows for a three-year corporate bond (a bond with three years to maturity) with an 8 percent coupon rate and a $1,000 face value. If the market rate of interest on similar bonds is 10 percent and interest payments are made annually, what is the market price of the bond? In other words, how much should you be willing to pay for the promised cash flow stream?

To value (or price) the bond, we can discount each of the payments back to time zero one at a time, and add those values up. We can also view the bond payments as being made up of a regular annuity of three annual payments of $80 each and a final lump sum payment of $1,000. Thus, the price of the bond (PB) is the sum of the present value calculations for the coupon payments (C) and the principal amount (F), discounted at the required rate (i). That calculation is:

EXHIBIT 8.1 Cash Flows for a Three-Year Bond The exhibit shows a time line for a three-year bond that pays an 8 percent coupon rate and has a face value of $1,000. How much should we pay for such a bond if the market rate of interest is 10 percent? To solve this problem, we discount the promised cash flows to the present and then add them up.


Notice that you could have simplified the calculation by combining the final coupon payment and the principal payment (C3 + F3), since both cash flows occur at time t = 3.

The above calculation suggests that the general equation for the price of the bond can be written as:

Or:

(8.1)
where:

PB = the price of the bond, or present value of the stream of cash payments

Ct = the coupon payment in period t, where t = 1, 2, 3, …, n

Fn = par value or face value (principal amount) to be paid at maturity

i = market interest rate (discount rate or yield)

n = number of periods to maturity

Note that there are five variables in the bond pricing equation. If we know any four of them, we can solve for the fifth.

Calculator Tip: Bond Valuation Problems
We can easily calculate bond prices using a financial calculator or a spreadsheet. We solve for bond prices and bond yields in exactly the same way we solved for the present value (bond price) and discount rate (bond yield) in Chapter 6. We solve our example problem on a financial calculator as follows:


Several points are worth noting:

Always draw a time line for the cash flows. This simple step will significantly reduce mistakes.
The PMT key enters the dollar amount of an ordinary annuity for n periods. In our example, keying in 3 with the N key and $80 with the PMT key enters an $80 annuity with the final payment made at the end of Year 3.
Be sure that you enter the coupon and the principal payments separately. Do not enter the final coupon payment ($80) and principal amount ($1,000) as a single entry of $1,080 on the FV key. The reason is that the PMT key is the annuity key, and when you enter N = 3, the $80 is entered in the calculator as a three-year ordinary annuity with a final payment of $80 in period t = 3. If you then enter $1,080 on the FV key, you will have an extra $80 in the final period (t = 3). In this example, we entered the $80 coupon payments with the PMT key and the $1,000 principal payment with the FV key.
Finally, as we have mentioned in earlier chapters, you must be consistent throughout a problem in how you enter the signs (positive or negative) for cash inflows and cash outflows. For example, if you are a bond investor and decide to enter all cash inflows with a positive sign, then you must enter all coupon and principal payments with a positive sign. The price you paid for the bond, which is a cash outflow, must be entered as a negative number. This is the convention we will follow.
The value from the financial calculator can differ from the value that we calculate when discounting individual cash flows due to rounding error.
Learning by Doing Application 8.1 illustrates another example of the use of a calculator to value a bond, and the Using Excel example that follows Application 8.1 illustrates the use of a spreadsheet to solve this problem.

Par, Premium, and Discount Bonds
One of the mathematical properties of the bond pricing equation is that whenever a bond’s coupon rate is equal to the market rate of interest on similar bonds (the bond’s yield), the bond will sell at par value. We call such bonds par-value bonds. For example, suppose that you own a three-year bond with a face value of $1,000 and an annual coupon rate of 5 percent, when the yield or market rate of interest on similar bonds is 5 percent. The price of your bond, based on Equation 8.1, is:

As predicted, the bond’s price equals its par value.

par-value bonds bonds that sell at par value, or face value; whenever a bond’s coupon rate is equal to the market rate of interest on similar bonds, the bond will sell at par (face) value

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 8.1
Pricing a Bond

Problem

Your investment advisor is trying to sell you a 15-year bond with a 7 percent coupon, and the interest, or yield, on similar bonds is 10 percent. Is the bond selling for a premium, at par, or at a discount? Answer the question without making any calculations, and then prove that your answer is correct. The time line is as follows:






Using Excel
Bond Prices and Yields

Calculating bond prices and yields using a spreadsheet may seem daunting at first. However, understanding the terminology used in the formulas will make the calculations a matter of common sense:

Settlement date—the date a buyer purchases the bond.

Maturity date—the date the bond expires. If you know only the “n” (number of years remaining) of the bond, use a date that is n years in the future in this field.

Redemption—the security’s redemption value per $10 face value. In other words, if the bond has a par value of $1,000, you enter 100 in this field.

Frequency—the number of coupon payments per year.


Here is a spreadsheet showing the setup for calculating the price of the discount bond described in Learning by Doing Application 8.1.

We first use the =PRICE(settlement, maturity, rate, yield, redemption, frequency) formula in Excel to calculate the bond price as a percentage of par. We then multiply this percentage (77.18 percent in the example) by $1,000 to obtain the bond price in dollars. A bond yield, which is discussed in the next section, is calculated in a similar manner, using the “=YIELD(settlement, maturity, rate, price, redemption, frequency)” formula.

Now assume that the market rate of interest rises overnight to 8 percent. What happens to the price of the bond? Will the bond’s price be below, above, or at par value?

When i is equal to 8 percent, the price of the bond declines to $922.69. The bond sells at a price below par value; such bonds are called discount bonds.

discount bonds bonds that sell at prices below par (face) value

Whenever a bond’s coupon rate is lower than the market rate of interest on similar bonds, the bond will sell at a discount. This is true because of the fixed nature of a bond’s coupon payments. Let’s return to our 5 percent coupon bond. If the market rate of interest is 8 percent and our bond pays only 5 percent, no economically rational person would buy the bond at its par value. This would be like choosing a bond with a 5 percent yield over one with an 8 percent yield. We cannot change the coupon rate to 8 percent because it is fixed for the life of the bond. That is why bonds are referred to as fixed-income securities. The only way to increase our bond’s yield to 8 percent is to reduce the price of the bond to $922.69. At this price, the bond’s yield will be precisely 8 percent, which is the current market rate for similar bonds. Through the price reduction of $77.31 ($1,000 − $922.69 = $77.31), the seller provides the new owner with additional “interest” in the form of a higher yield.

What would happen to the price of the bond if interest rates on similar bonds declined to 2 percent and the coupon rate remained at 5 percent? The price would rise to $1,086.52. At this price, the bond’s yield would be precisely 2 percent, which is the current market yield. The $86.52 ($1,086.52 − $1,000 = $86.52) premium adjusts the bond’s yield to 2 percent, which is the current market yield for similar bonds. Bonds that sell at prices above par are called premium bonds. Whenever a bond’s coupon rate is higher than the market rate of interest, the bond will sell at a premium.

premium bonds bonds that sell at prices above par (face) value

Our discussion of bond pricing can be summarized as follows, where i is the market rate of interest:

i > coupon rate—the bond sells for a discount
i < coupon rate—the bond sells for a premium
i = coupon rate—the bond sells at par value
The negative relation between changes in the level of interest rates and changes in the price of a bond (or any fixed-income security) is one of the most fundamental relations in corporate finance. The relation exists because the coupon payments on most bonds are fixed and the only way bonds can pay the current market rate of interest to investors is through an adjustment in the price of the bond. This is exactly what happened to the bonds of Hertz as discussed at the beginning of this chapter. As the risk of those bonds increased, their prices declined so that investors received a market rate of interest that reflected the bond’s higher risk.

Semiannual Compounding
In Europe, bonds generally pay coupon interest on an annual basis. In contrast, in the United States, most bonds pay coupon interest semiannually—that is, twice a year. Thus, if a bond has an 8 percent coupon rate (paid semiannually), each year the bondholder will receive two coupon payments of $40 each, totaling $80 ($40 × 2 = $80). We can modify Equation 8.1 as follows to adjust for coupon payments made more than once a year:

(8.2)
where C is the annual coupon payment, m is the number of times coupon payments are made each year, n is the number of years to maturity, and i is the annual market interest rate. In the case of a bond with semiannual coupon payments, m equals 2.

Whether we are computing bond prices annually, semiannually, quarterly, or for some other period, the computation is the same. We need only be sure that the bond’s yield, coupon payment, and maturity are adjusted to be consistent with the bond’s stated compounding period. Once that information is converted to the correct compounding period, it can simply be entered into Equation 8.1. Thus, there is really no need to memorize or use Equation 8.2 unless you find it helpful. Let’s work an example to demonstrate.

Earlier we determined that a three-year, 5 percent coupon bond will sell for $922.69 when the market rate of interest is 8 percent. Our computation assumed that coupon payments were made annually. What is the price of the bond if the coupon payments are made semiannually? The time line for the semiannual coupon bond is:


We convert the bond data to semiannual compounding as follows: (1) the yield is 4 percent semiannually (8 percent per year/2 = 4 percent), (2) the coupon payment is $25 semiannually ($50 per year/2 = $25), and (3) the total number of coupon payments is 6 (2 payments per year × 3 years = 6 payments). Plugging the data into Equation 8.1, we find that the bond price is:

Notice that the price of the bond is slightly less with semiannual compounding than with annual compounding ($921.37 < $922.69). The slight difference in price reflects the change in the timing of the cash flows and the interest rate adjustment.1

Learning by Doing Application 8.2 illustrates the use of a calculator to value a bond with semiannual coupon payments.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 8.2
Bond Pricing with Semiannual Coupon Payments

Problem

A corporate treasurer decides to purchase a 20-year U.S Government Treasury bond with a 4 percent coupon rate. If the current market rate of interest for similar Treasury securities is 4.5 percent, what is the price of the bond?





Zero Coupon Bonds
As previously mentioned, zero coupon bonds have no coupon payments but promise a single payment at maturity. The price (or yield) of a zero coupon bond is simply a special case of Equation 8.2 in which all the coupon payments are equal to zero.

Hence, the pricing equation for a zero coupon bond is:

(8.3)
where:

PB = the price of the bond

Fmn = the amount of the cash payment at maturity (face value)

i = annual market interest rate (discount rate or yield)

n = number of years until the payment is due

m = number of times interest is compounded each year

Notice that if a zero coupon bond compounds annually, m = 1 and Equation 8.3 becomes:

Now let’s work an example. What is the price of a zero coupon bond with a $1,000 face value, 10-year maturity, and semiannual compounding when the market interest rate is 12 percent? Since the bond compounds interest semiannually, the number of compounding periods is 20 (m × n = 2 × 10 = 20). The semiannual interest is 6 percent (12 percent/2 = 6 percent). The time line for the cash flows is as follows:


Plugging the data into Equation 8.3, we find that the price of the bond is:

Notice that the zero coupon bond is selling at a very large (deep) discount. This should come as no surprise, since the bond has no coupon payment and all the dollars paid to investors are paid at maturity. Why are zero coupon bonds so heavily discounted compared with similar bonds that do have coupon payments? From Chapter 5, we know that because of the time value of money, dollars to be received in the future have less value than current dollars. Thus, zero coupon bonds, for which all the cash payments are made at maturity, must sell for less than similar bonds that make coupon payments before maturity.

8.3 Bond Yields
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Distinguish between a bond’s coupon rate, yield to maturity, and effective annual yield.
We frequently know a bond’s price from an offer to sell it, but not its yield to maturity. In this section, we discuss how to compute the yield to maturity and some other important bond yields.

Yield to Maturity
The yield to maturity of a bond is the discount rate that makes the present value of the coupon and principal payments equal to the price of the bond. The yield to maturity can be viewed as a promised yield because it is the annual return that the investor earns if the bond is held to maturity and all the coupon and principal payments are made as promised. A bond’s yield to maturity changes daily as interest rates increase or decrease, but its calculation is always based on the issuer’s promise to make interest and principal payments as stipulated in the bond contract.

yield to maturity for a bond, the discount rate that makes the present value of the coupon and principal payments equal to the price of the bond

Let’s work through an example to see how a bond’s yield to maturity is calculated. Suppose you decide to buy a three-year bond with a 6 percent coupon rate for $960.99. For simplicity, we will assume that the coupon payments are made annually. The time line for the cash flows is as follows:


To compute the yield to maturity, we apply Equation 8.1 and solve for i. We can set up the problem using Equation 8.1 as follows:

As we discussed in Chapter 6, we cannot solve for i mathematically; we must find it by trial and error. We know that the bond is selling for a discount because its price is below par, so the yield must be higher than the 6 percent coupon rate. Let’s try 7 percent.

The computed price of $973.76 is still greater than our market price of $960.99; thus, we need to use a slightly larger discount rate. Let’s try 7.7 percent.

Our computed value of $955.95 is now less than the market price of $960.99, so we need a lower discount rate. We’ll try 7.5 percent.

At a discount rate of 7.5 percent, the price of the bond is exactly equal to the market price, and thus, the bond’s yield to maturity is 7.5 percent.

We can, of course, also compute the bond’s yield to maturity using a financial calculator or spreadsheet. Computing the yield in this way is no different from computing the price, except that the unknown is the bond’s yield. As with calculating the price of a bond, the major source of computational errors is failing to make sure that all the bond data are consistent with the bond’s compounding period. The three variables that may require adjustment are (1) the coupon payment, (2) the yield, and (3) the bond maturity.

For the three-year corporate bond discussed earlier, the bond data are already in a form that is consistent with the annual compounding period, so we enter it into the calculator and solve for i, which is the yield to maturity:


The bond’s yield to maturity is 7.5 percent, which is identical to the answer from our hand calculation.

Effective Annual Yield
Up to now, when pricing a bond with a semiannual compounding period, we assumed the bond’s annual yield to be twice the semiannual yield. This is the convention used on Wall Street and by other practitioners who deal in bonds. However, notice that bond yields quoted in this manner are just like the APRs discussed in Chapter 6. For example, we showed that the APR for a bank credit card with a 1 percent monthly interest rate is simply the monthly interest rate multiplied by the number of months in a year, or 12 percent. As you recall, interest rates (or yields) annualized in this manner do not take compounding into account. Hence, the values calculated are not the true cost of funds.

As a result, annualized yields calculated by multiplying a yield per period by the number of compounding periods are only acceptable for decision-making purposes when comparing bonds that have the same compounding frequencies. For example, an investor must be careful when comparing yields of European and U.S. bonds, since interest on a European bond is compounded annually while interest on a U.S. bond compounds twice a year.

The correct way to annualize an interest rate is to compute the effective annual interest rate (EAR). In financial markets, the EAR is called the effective annual yield (EAY); thus, EAR = EAY. Drawing on Equation 6.7 (see Chapter 6), we find that the correct way to annualize the yield on a bond is as follows:

effective annual yield (EAY) the annual yield that takes compounding into account; another name for the effective annual interest rate (EAR)

Let’s work through an example to see how the EAY differs from the yield to maturity. Suppose an investor buys a 30-year bond with a $1,000 face value for $800. The bond’s coupon rate is 8 percent, and interest payments are made semiannually. What is the bond’s yield to maturity, and what is its EAY? To find out, we first need to convert the bond’s annual data into semiannual data: (1) the 30-year bond has 60 compounding periods (30 years × 2 periods per year = 60 periods), and (2) the bond’s semiannual coupon payment is $40 [($1,000 × 0.08)/2 = $80/2 = $40]. The time line for this bond is:


We can set up the problem using Equation 8.1 (or 8.2) as:

Solving an equation with so many terms by hand can be time consuming. Therefore, we will solve for the yield to maturity using the yield function in a financial calculator as follows:


The answer is 5.07 percent. We then multiply the semiannual yield by 2 to convert it to an annual yield: 2 × 5.07 percent = 10.14 percent. This is the bond’s yield to maturity.

If, instead of multiplying 5.07 percent by 2, we calculate the EAY for the semiannual yield of 5.07 percent, we get:

The EAY of 10.40 percent is greater than the annual yield to maturity of 10.14 percent because the EAY takes into account the effects of compounding over multiple periods per year—earning interest on interest.

Learning by Doing Application 8.4 illustrates the use of the EAY concept in choosing between different investments.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 8.4
Choosing between Bonds with Different Coupon Payment Frequencies

Problem

You can purchase a U.S. corporate bond from your financial advisor for $1,099.50. The bond has six years to maturity and an annual coupon rate of 5 percent. Alternatively, she offers you a dollar Eurobond (a dollar-denominated bond sold overseas) with a yield of 3.17 percent, which is denominated in U.S. dollars, has the same maturity and credit rating as the U.S. corporate bond, and pays a coupon once per year. Which bond should you buy?





Realized Yield
The yield to maturity (or promised yield) tells the investor the return on a bond if the bond is held to maturity and all the coupon and principal payments are made as promised. Quite often, however, the investor will sell the bond before maturity. The realized yield is the return earned on a bond given the cash flows actually received by the investor. More formally, it is the interest rate at which the present value of the actual cash flows from the investment equals the bond’s price. The realized yield allows investors to see the return they actually earned on their investment. It is the same as the holding period return discussed in Chapter 7.

realized yield for a bond, the interest rate at which the present value of the actual cash flows from the bond equals the bond’s price

Let’s return to the situation involving a three-year bond with a 6 percent coupon that was purchased for $960.99 and had a promised yield of 7.5 percent. Suppose that interest rates increased sharply and the price of the bond plummeted. Disgruntled, you sold the bond for $750.79 after having owned it for two years. The time line for the realized cash flows looks like this:


Substituting the cash flows into Equation 8.1 yields the following:

We can solve this equation for i either by trial and error or with a financial calculator or spreadsheet, as described earlier. Using a financial calculator, the solution is as follows:


The result is a realized yield of negative 4.97 percent. The difference between the promised yield of 7.50 percent and the realized yield of negative 4.97 percent is 12.47 percent [7.50 percent − (−4.97 percent) = 12.47 percent], which can be accounted for by the capital loss of $210.20 ($960.99 − $750.79 = $210.20) from the decline in the bond price.

8.4 Interest Rate Risk
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain why investors in bonds are subject to interest rate risk and why it is important to understand the bond theorems.
As discussed previously, the prices of bonds fluctuate with changes in interest rates, giving rise to interest rate risk. Anyone who owns bonds is subject to interest rate risk because interest rates are always changing in financial markets. A number of relations exist between bond prices and changes in interest rates. These are often called the bond theorems, but they apply to all fixed-income securities. It is important that investors and financial managers understand these theorems.

interest rate risk uncertainty about future bond values that is caused by the unpredictability of interest rates

Bond Theorems
Bond prices are negatively related to interest rate movements. As interest rates decline, the prices of bonds rise; and as interest rates rise, the prices of bonds decline. As mentioned earlier, this negative relation exists because the coupon rate on most bonds is fixed at the time the bonds are issued. Note that this negative relation is observed not only for bonds but also for all other financial claims that pay a fixed rate of interest to investors, such as bank loans and home mortgages.
For a given change in interest rates, the prices of long-term bonds will change more than the prices of short-term bonds. In other words, long-term bonds have greater price volatility (risk) than short-term bonds because, all other things being equal, long-term bonds have greater interest rate risk than short-term bonds. Exhibit 8.2 illustrates the fact that bond values are not equally affected by changes in market interest rates. The exhibit shows how the prices of a 1-year bond and a 30-year bond change with changing interest rates. As you can see, the long-term bond has much wider price swings than the short-term bond. Why? The answer is that long-term bonds receive most of their cash flows farther into the future, and because of the time value of money, these cash flows are heavily discounted. This makes the 30-year bond riskier than the 1-year bond.
For a given change in interest rates, the prices of lower-coupon bonds change more than the prices of higher-coupon bonds. Exhibit 8.3 illustrates the relation between bond price volatility and coupon rates. The exhibit shows the prices of three 10-year bonds: a zero coupon bond, a 5 percent coupon bond, and a 10 percent coupon bond. Initially, the bonds are priced to yield 5 percent (see column 2). The bonds are then priced at yields of 6 and 4 percent (see columns 3 and 6). The dollar price changes for each bond given the appropriate interest rate change are recorded in columns 4 and 7, and percentage price changes (price volatilities) are shown in columns 5 and 8.
EXHIBIT 8.2 Relation between Bond Price Volatility and Maturity The prices of a 1-year and a 30-year bond respond differently to changes in market interest rates. The long-term bond has much wider price swings than the short-term bond, as predicted by the second bond theorem.


EXHIBIT 8.3 Relation between Bond Price Volatility and the Coupon Rate

The exhibit shows the prices of three 10-year bonds: a zero coupon bond, a 5 percent coupon bond, and a 10 percent coupon bond. Initially, the bonds are priced at a 5 percent yield (column 2). The bonds are then priced at yields of 6 and 4 percent (columns 3 and 6). The price changes shown are consistent with the third bond theorem: the smaller the coupon rate, the greater the percentage price change for a given change in interest rates.

(1)	(2)	Price Change if Yield Increases from 5% to 6%	Price Change if Yield Decreases from 5% to 4%
(3)	(4)	(5)	(6)	(7)	(8)
Coupon Rate	Bond Price at 5% Yield	Bond Price at 6%	Loss from Increase in Yield	% Price Change	Bond Price at 4%	Gain from Decrease in Yield	% Price Change
0%	    $613.91	    $558.39	$55.52	−9.04%	    $675.56	    $61.65	10.04%
5%	$1,000.00	    $926.40	$73.60	−7.36%	$1,081.11	    $81.11	    8.11%
10%	$1,386.09	$1,294.40	$91.69	−6.61%	$1,486.65	$100.57	    7.26%
Note: Calculations are based on a bond with a $1,000 face value and a 10-year maturity and assume annual compounding.
As shown in column 5, when interest rates increase from 5 to 6 percent, the zero coupon bond experiences the greatest percentage price decline, and the 10 percent bond experiences the smallest percentage price decline. Similar results are shown in column 8 for interest rate decreases. In sum, the lower a bond’s coupon rate, the greater its price volatility, and hence, lower-coupon bonds have greater interest rate risk.

The reason for the higher interest rate risk for low-coupon bonds is essentially the same as the reason for the higher interest rate risk for long-term bonds. The lower the bond’s coupon rate, the greater the proportion of the bond’s total cash flows investors will receive at maturity. This is clearly seen with a zero coupon bond, where all of the bond’s cash flows are received at maturity. The farther into the future the cash flows are to be received, the greater the impact of a change in the discount rate on their present value. Thus, all other things being equal, a given change in interest rates will have a greater impact on the price of a low-coupon bond than on the price of a higher-coupon bond with the same maturity.

Bond Theorem Applications
The bond theorems provide important information about bond price behavior for financial managers. For example, if you are the treasurer of a firm and are investing cash temporarily—say, for a few days—the last security you want to purchase is a long-term zero coupon bond. In contrast, if you are an investor and you expect interest rates to decline, you may well want to invest in a long-term zero coupon bond. This is because as interest rates decline, the prices of long-term zero coupon bonds will increase more than those of any other type of bond.

Make no mistake, forecasting interest rate movements and investing in long-term bonds is a very high-risk strategy. In 1990, for example, executives at Shearson Lehman Hutton (predecessor to Lehman Brothers, the firm that famously went bankrupt in 2008, the beginning of the Great Recession) made a huge bet on interest rate movements and lost. Specifically, over a number of months, the firm made investments in long-term bonds that totaled $480 million. The bet was that interest rates would decline. When interest rates failed to decline and losses mounted, the Shearson team sold the bonds at a loss totaling $115 million. The executives responsible were fired for “lack of judgment.”

Decision Making Example 8.1 illustrates another application of the bond theorems.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 8.1
Risk Taking

Situation

You work for the treasurer of a large manufacturing corporation where earnings are down substantially for the year. The treasurer’s staff is convinced that interest rates are going to decline over the next three months, and they want to invest in fixed-income securities to make as much money as possible for the firm. The staff recommends investing in one of the following securities:

3-month U.S. Government Treasury bill
20-year corporate bond
20-year zero coupon U.S. Government Treasury bond
The treasurer asks you to answer the following questions about the staff’s plan: (1) What is the underlying strategy of the proposed plan? (2) Which investment should be selected if the plan is executed? (3) What should the treasurer do?



The moral of the story is simple. Long-term bonds carry substantially more interest rate risk than short-term bonds, and investors in long-term bonds need to fully understand the magnitude of the risk involved. Furthermore, no one can predict interest rate movements consistently, including the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed)—and it controls the money supply.

8.5 The Determinants of Corporate Borrowing Costs
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss the concept of default risk and know how to compute a default risk premium.
In Chapter 2 we discussed the economic forces that determine the level of interest rates, and so far in this chapter, we have discussed how to price various types of debt securities. Armed with this knowledge, we now explore why, on the same day, different firms have different borrowing costs. As you will see, market analysts have identified three characteristics of debt instruments that are responsible for many of the differences in corporate borrowing costs: the security’s marketability, call provision, and default risk.

Marketability
The interest rate, or yield, on a security varies with its degree of marketability. Recall from Chapter 2 that marketability refers to the ease with which an investor can sell a security quickly at a low transaction cost. The transaction costs include all fees and the cost of searching for information. The lower the costs, the greater a security’s marketability. Because investors prefer marketable securities, they must be paid a premium to purchase otherwise similar securities that are less marketable. The difference in interest rates or yields between a highly marketable security and a less marketable security is known as the marketability risk premium (MRP) and can be defined as follows:

where ilow mkt is the yield on a low or less marketable security and ihigh mkt is the yield on a more highly marketable security.

U.S. Treasury bills have the largest and most active secondary market and are considered to be the most marketable of all securities. Investors can sell virtually any dollar amount of Treasury securities quickly without disrupting the market. Similarly, the securities of many well-known businesses enjoy a high degree of marketability, especially firms whose securities are traded on the major exchanges. For thousands of other firms whose securities are not traded actively, a lack of marketability can raise borrowing costs substantially.

Call Provision
Most corporate bond contracts contain a call provision. A call provision gives the firm issuing the bonds the option to purchase the bond from an investor at a predetermined price (the call price). The investor must sell the bond at that price to the firm when the firm exercises this option. Bonds with a call provision pay higher yields than comparable noncallable bonds. Investors require the higher yields because call provisions work to the benefit of the borrower and the detriment of the investor. For example, if interest rates decline after the bond is issued, the issuer can call (retire) the bonds at the call price and refinance with a new bond issued at the lower prevailing market rate of interest. The issuing firm is delighted because the refinancing has lowered its interest expense. However, investors are less gleeful. When bonds are called following a decline in interest rates, investors suffer a financial loss because they are forced to surrender their high-yielding bonds and reinvest their funds at the lower prevailing market rate of interest.

The difference in interest rates between a callable bond and a comparable noncallable bond is called the call interest premium (CIP) and can be defined as follows:

where CIP is the call interest premium, icall is the yield on a callable bond, and incall is the yield on a noncallable bond of the same marketability, default risk, and term to maturity. Thus, the more likely a bond is to be called, the higher the CIP and the higher the bond’s market yield. Bonds issued during periods when interest rates are high are likely to be called when interest rates decline, and as a result, these bonds have a large CIP. Conversely, bonds sold when interest rates are relatively low are less likely to be called and have a smaller CIP.

Default Risk
Recall that any debt, such as a bond or a bank loan, is a formal promise by the borrower to make periodic interest payments and pay the principal as specified in the debt contract. Failure on the borrower’s part to meet any condition of the debt or loan contract constitutes default. As discussed in Chapter 4, default risk refers to the risk that the borrower will not be able to pay its debt obligations as they come due.

The Default Risk Premium

Because investors are risk averse, they must be paid a premium to purchase a security that exposes them to default risk. The size of the premium has two components: (1) compensation for the expected loss if a default occurs and (2) compensation for bearing the risk that a default could occur. The degree of default risk for a security can be measured as the difference between the interest rate on the risky security and the interest rate on a default-free security—all other factors, such as marketability, the existence of a call provision, or term to maturity, are held constant. The default risk premium (DRP) is defined as follows:

where idr is the interest rate (yield) on the security that has default risk and irf is the interest rate (yield) on a risk-free security. U.S. Treasury securities are the best proxy measure for the risk-free rate. The larger the default risk premium, the higher the probability of default, and the higher the security’s market yield.

Bond Ratings

Many investors, especially individuals and smaller businesses, do not have the expertise to formulate the probabilities of default themselves, so they must rely on credit rating agencies to provide this information. The three most prominent credit rating agencies are Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), Standard & Poor’s (S&P), and Fitch. All three credit rating services rank bonds in order of their expected probability of default and publish the ratings as letter grades. The rating schemes used are shown in Exhibit 8.4. The highest-grade bonds, those with the lowest default risk, are rated Aaa (or AAA). The default risk premium on corporate bonds increases as the bond rating becomes lower. In 2020, only two U.S. companies maintained a Aaa credit rating: Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. While this may seem unusual, in Chapter 16 we will discuss the costs and potential offsetting benefits for firms that elect to carry lower credit ratings.

Exhibit 8.4 also shows that bonds in the top four rating categories are called investment-grade bonds. Bonds rated below Baa (or BBB) may be referred to as noninvestment-grade bonds, but most practitioners refer to them as speculative-grade bonds, high-yield bonds, or junk bonds. The distinction between investment-grade and noninvestment-grade bonds is important because state and federal laws typically require commercial banks, insurance companies, pension funds, other financial institutions, and government agencies to purchase only securities rated as investment grade.

investment-grade bonds bonds with low risk of default that are rated Baa (BBB) or above

noninvestment-grade bonds bonds rated below Baa (or BBB) by rating agencies; often called speculative-grade bonds, high-yield bonds, or junk bonds

EXHIBIT 8.4 Corporate Bond Rating Systems

Moody’s has a slightly different notation in its ratings of corporate bonds than do Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, but the interpretation is the same. Bonds with the highest credit standing are rated Aaa (or AAA) and have the lowest default risk. The credit rating declines as the default risk increases.


EXHIBIT 8.5 Default Risk Premiums for Selected Bond Ratings

The default risk premium (DRP) measures the yield difference between the yield on Treasury securities (the risk-free rate) and the yields on riskier securities of the same maturity.
Security: Credit Rating	Security Yield (%) (1)	Risk-Free Ratea (%) (2)	Default Risk:Premium (%) (1) − (2)
Aaa/AAA	2.20	1.49	0.71
Aa/AA	2.68	1.49	1.19
A/A	3.18	1.49	1.69
Baa/BBB	4.37	1.49	2.88

Exhibit 8.5 shows default risk premiums associated with selected bonds with investment-grade bond ratings in December 2020. The premiums are the differences between yields on Treasury securities—which, as mentioned, are the proxy for the risk-free rate—and yields on riskier securities of similar maturity. The 0.71 percent default risk premium on Aaa-rated corporate bonds represents the market consensus of the amount investors must be compensated to induce them to purchase typical Aaa-rated bonds instead of a risk-free security. As credit quality declines from Aaa to Baa, the default risk premiums increase from 0.71 percent to 2.88 percent.

8.6 The Term Structure of Interest Rates
Learning Objective

Describe the factors that determine the level and shape of the yield curve.
In the preceding section, we described how marketability, call provisions, and default risk determine the cost of borrowing for a company. The term to maturity for a loan is also important for borrowing costs. The term to maturity of a loan is the length of time until the principal amount is payable. The relation between yield to maturity and term to maturity is known as the term structure of interest rates. We can view the term structure visually by plotting the yield curve, a graph with term to maturity on the horizontal axis and yield to maturity on the vertical axis. Yield curves show graphically how market yields vary as term to maturity changes.

term structure of interest rates the relation between yield to maturity and term to maturity

yield curve a graph representing the term structure of interest rates, with the term to maturity on the horizontal axis and the yield on the vertical axis

For yield curves to be meaningful, the securities used to plot the curves should be similar in all features (for example, marketability, call provisions, and default risk) except for maturity. We do not want to confound the relation of yield and term to maturity with other factors that also affect interest rates. We can see the term structure relation by examining yields on U.S. Treasury securities with different maturities because their other features are similar.

Exhibit 8.6 shows data and yield curve plots for Treasury securities at various points in time. As you can see, the shape of the yield curve is not constant over time. As the general level of interest rises and falls, the yield curve shifts up and down and has different slopes.

Note that the yield curve as of December 2020 is lower than the yield curve just three years earlier in December 2017. Also, short-term rates in December 2020 were very close to zero (0.09 percent), which is extremely low by historical standards. In fact, in some European countries’ short-term rates have even been negative in recent years. A negative rate means that rather than earning interest, investors are effectively paying to lend money! Additionally, with interest rates at low levels, bond investors might be concerned about potential interest rate increases. As we know, when interest rates rise, bond prices fall and bondholders can face capital losses. A broader implication is that bond investors might start looking for higher returns elsewhere, which in turn likely involves different and riskier investments, a topic we will discuss further in later chapters.

EXHIBIT 8.6 Yield Curves for Treasury Securities at Three Different Points in Time The shape, or slope, of the yield curve is not constant over time. The exhibit shows two shapes: (1) the curves for December 2020 and January 2017 are upward sloping, which is the shape most commonly observed, and (2) the curve for September 2019 is downward sloping for maturities out to five years.


Interest Rate (%)
Terms to Maturity	December 2020	September 2019	December 2017
6 months	0.09	1.88	0.63
1 year	0.09	1.72	0.82
5 year	0.39	1.35	1.94
10 years	0.95	1.47	2.49
20 years	1.49	1.77	2.80
We can observe three basic shapes (slopes) of yield curves in the marketplace. First is the ascending, or upward-sloping, yield curve (December 2017 and December 2020), which is the shape most commonly observed. Second, descending, or downward-sloping, yield curves, such as the curve in September 2019, appear periodically and are characterized by short-term yields (for example, the six-month yield) that exceed long-term yields (for example, the 10-year yield). Downward-sloping yield curves often appear before the beginning of a recession. Finally, relatively flat yield curves are not common but do occur from time to time. Three factors affect the level and the shape (the slope) of the yield curve over time: the real rate of interest, the expected rate of inflation, and interest rate risk.

The real rate of interest is the base interest rate in the economy and is determined by individuals’ time preference for consumption; that is, it tells us how much individuals must be paid to forgo spending their money today. The real rate of interest varies with the business cycle, with the highest rates seen at the end of a period of business expansion and the lowest at the bottom of a recession. The real rate is not affected by the term to maturity. Thus, the real rate of interest affects the level of interest rates but not the shape of the yield curve.

The expected rate of inflation can influence the shape of the yield curve. If investors believe that inflation will increase in the future, the yield curve will be upward sloping because long-term interest rates will contain a larger inflation premium than short-term interest rates. The inflation premium is the market’s best estimate of future inflation. Conversely, if investors believe inflation will subside in the future, the prevailing yield will be downward sloping.

Finally, the presence of interest rate risk affects the shape of the yield curve. As discussed earlier, long-term bonds have greater price volatility than short-term bonds. Because investors are aware of this risk, they demand compensation in the form of an interest rate premium. It follows that the longer the maturity of a security, the greater its interest rate risk, and the higher the interest rate. It is important to note that the interest rate risk premium always adds an upward bias to the slope of the yield curve.

In sum, the cumulative effect of three economic factors determines the level and shape of the yield curve: (1) the cyclical movements of the real rate of interest affect the level of the yield curve, (2) the expected rate of inflation can bias the slope of the yield curve either positively or negatively, depending on market expectations of inflation, and (3) interest rate risk always provides an upward bias to the slope of the yield curve.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Describe the market for corporate bonds and three types of corporate bonds.

The market for corporate bonds is a very large market in which the most important investors are large institutions. Most trades take place through dealers in the OTC market, making the corporate bond market relatively thin. Prices of corporate bonds tend to be more volatile than prices of securities that trade more frequently, such as stocks and money market instruments, and the corporate bond market tends to be less efficient than markets for these other securities.

A vanilla bond pays fixed regular coupon payments over the life of the bond, and the entire principal is repaid at maturity. A zero coupon bond pays all interest and all principal at maturity. Since there are no payments before maturity, zero coupon bonds are issued at prices below their face value. Convertible bonds can be exchanged for common stock at a predetermined ratio.

2 Explain how to calculate the value of a bond and why bond prices vary negatively with interest rate movements.

The value of a bond is equal to the present value of the future cash flows (coupon payments and principal repayment) discounted at the market rate of interest for bonds with similar risk. Bond prices vary negatively with interest rates because the coupon rate on most bonds is fixed at the time the bond is issued. As market interest rates go up, the prices of bonds with fixed coupon payments will be bid down by investors, driving up the yields of those bonds to market levels. When interest rates decline, the yield on fixed-income securities will be higher relative to the yield on similar securities in the market; the favorable yield will increase investor demand for these securities, increasing their price and lowering their yield to the market yield.

3 Distinguish between a bond’s coupon rate, yield to maturity, and effective annual yield.

A bond’s coupon rate is the interest rate on the bond, relative to its face value. U.S. bonds typically pay interest semiannually, whereas European bonds pay once a year. The yield to maturity is the expected return on a bond if it is held to its maturity date. The effective annual yield is the yield an investor actually earns in one year, adjusting for the effects of compounding. If the bond pays coupon payments more often than annually, the effective annual yield will be higher than the simple annual yield because of compounding. Work through Learning by Doing Applications 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4 to master these calculations.

4 Explain why investors in bonds are subject to interest rate risk and why it is important to understand the bond theorems.

Because interest rates are always changing in the market, all investors who hold bonds are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is uncertainty about future bond values caused by fluctuations in interest rates. Three of the most important bond theorems can be summarized as follows:

Bond prices are negatively related to interest rate movements.
For a given change in interest rates, the prices of long-term bonds will change more than the prices of short-term bonds.
For a given change in interest rates, the prices of lower-coupon bonds will change more than the prices of higher-coupon bonds.
Understanding these theorems is important because it helps investors better understand why bond prices change and, thus, make better decisions regarding the purchase or sale of bonds and other fixed-income securities.

5 Discuss the concept of default risk and know how to compute a default risk premium.

Default risk is the risk that the issuer will be unable to pay its debt obligation. Since investors are risk averse, they must be paid a premium to purchase a security that exposes them to default risk. The default risk premium has two components: (1) compensation for the expected loss if a default occurs and (2) compensation for bearing the risk that a default could occur. All factors held constant, the degree of default risk a security possesses can be measured as the difference between the interest rate on a risky security and the interest rate on a default-free security. The default risk is also reflected in the company’s bond rating. The highest-grade bonds, those with the lowest default risk, are rated Aaa (or AAA). The default risk premium on corporate bonds increases as the bond rating becomes lower.

6 Describe the factors that determine the level and shape of the yield curve.

The level and shape of the yield curve are determined by three factors: (1) the real rate of interest, (2) the expected rate of inflation, and (3) interest rate risk. The real rate of interest is the base interest rate in the economy and varies with the business cycle. The real rate of interest affects only the level of the yield curve and not its shape. The expected rate of inflation does affect the shape of the yield curve. If investors believe inflation will increase in the future, for example, the curve will be upward sloping, as long-term rates will contain a larger inflation premium than short-term rates. Finally, interest rate risk, which increases with a security’s maturity, adds an upward bias to the slope of the yield curve.

The Subprime Mortgage Market Meltdown: How Did It Happen?
The U.S. economy appeared strong throughout the first half of 2007, but many observers saw clouds on the horizon in the form of trouble brewing in the subprime home mortgage market. Fear of the coming storm intensified as housing prices dropped, home foreclosures increased, major subprime mortgage lenders filed for bankruptcy, and investors took losses on mortgage-backed securities. By the end of the year, many were predicting a serious economic downturn.


“It’s not like a bottle of water,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress. “It’s much more like a pond where ripples start and can spread quickly…. The subprime ripple leads to another ripple of lower housing prices and a credit crunch for banks and financial markets. Another ripple driven by consumer anxiety causes lower consumer spending, which makes up nearly two-thirds of our economic growth, and leads to an even larger ripple that may end up causing a recession.”1

What Are Subprime Mortgages?

The subprime mortgages at the center of all this turmoil were made to borrowers who had poor credit histories or who were considered high credit risks for other reasons. Subprime mortgages are a relatively recent phenomenon because, prior to the 1980s, usury laws limited the ability of lenders to charge interest rates that adequately compensated them for the risks associated with these loans. As a result, subprime mortgage loans were simply not made before the usury laws were relaxed.

Several new federal laws were passed in the 1980s that, among other things, eliminated interest rate caps and made it possible for high-risk borrowers to obtain home mortgages. The subprime market experienced ups and downs in the 1990s, but by the early 2000s it had become an important part of the broader mortgage market. Loans originated in the subprime market made up less than 5 percent of mortgage loans in 1994 but increased to 13 percent in 2000 and to more than 20 percent in 2005 and 2006.2 The increase after 2000 accompanied a rapid rise in home prices in many real estate markets throughout the United States. Higher prices resulted in larger mortgage loans, which in turn increased the average risk of new loans, because incomes were not rising as quickly as home prices.

The emergence of the subprime market was accompanied by a number of changes in the structure of mortgage lending. Traditionally, a person who wanted a mortgage loan dealt with a bank or a savings and loan institution, which granted the loan (or refused to grant it), financed the loan with deposits, collected the payments, and foreclosed on the property if the payments weren’t made. Today, these activities are much more likely to be carried out by separate institutions. For example, a majority of subprime mortgages are originated by mortgage brokers—intermediaries that earn a fee by bringing borrowers and lenders together. Once the loans are made, the lenders often resell the resulting mortgages.

Beginning in the 1990s, the securitization of mortgage loans became quite popular. This practice involves bundling groups of loans with similar characteristics and selling claims on the cash flows from these bundles, called mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). Most commonly, MBSs are sold to institutional investors by investment banks. Investors in mortgage-backed securities include insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds, among others. The securitization of subprime loans increased from about 32 percent of all such loans in 1994 to about 78 percent in 2006.3 This development meant that much of the relatively high risk associated with subprime loans was spread among a large number of investors, rather than a relatively small number of lending institutions.

Over the same period, a number of new kinds of mortgages were developed to supplement the traditional fixed-rate mortgage. Especially important in the subprime market are various kinds of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). The interest rate in an ARM changes (resets) at regular intervals—once a year, for example—in response to changes in some index, such as the prime rate. Many subprime ARMs are hybrids that start with low “teaser” rates that remain constant for a certain period, typically two or three years. After that period is over, the mortgage “resets.” Thereafter, it is adjusted periodically.

In addition, no-documentation loans appeared in the early 2000s as housing prices began their rapid rise. With these loans, lenders do not even ask for verification of the borrower’s income.

What Went Wrong?

Many observers touted the benefits of subprime loans in enabling previously disadvantaged groups, such as those living in poor or minority neighborhoods, to become homeowners. In addition, lenders initially earned large profits by charging these borrowers high interest rates and, because so many of the mortgages were securitized, a relatively large number of investors earned high returns.

So how did this evidently great idea turn into an economic disaster? Remember that subprime borrowers are risky borrowers—they’re considered more likely to default on their loans. And that’s just what happened. Beginning in 2006, more and more subprime borrowers fell behind on their loan payments, and many of them ended up defaulting. This began a long upward trend in foreclosures that showed little sign of slowing even by the end of 2010. Several economic conditions contributed to the high rate of defaults. For one thing, the prime rate of interest, which had been declining or holding steady since 2001, began to rise in 2004, affecting the rate to which interest on ARMs was reset. To further complicate the situation, housing prices, which had been increasing steadily, began to drop in 2006, leaving some buyers owing more than the current value of their homes.

As a result of the large number of defaults, subprime lenders found themselves in deep financial trouble, and some top lenders filed for bankruptcy. Lenders were originating fewer loans and were finding it difficult to sell those that they had originated. Investment bankers who had purchased loans and securitized them also suffered. In order to get the highest possible prices, they had retained some exposure to the riskiest parts of the loan bundles that they sold. As the default rates on loans underlying MBSs increased, the investment bankers suffered losses, as did the investors who bought the securities.

As investors in other types of fixed-income securities saw what was happening to the values of securitized subprime mortgages, they became concerned about the values of similar securitized debt instruments, such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). CLOs are securitized business loans, which included business loans that had been used to fund leveraged buyouts and were therefore also quite risky. Investors’ concerns caused prices for CLOs to decline rapidly. In addition, banks and other lenders began to tighten their credit standards, which made it more difficult for businesses and individuals to get loans, further contributing to a general weakening of the economy.

Who’s to Blame?

Inevitably, observers looked around for someone to blame for the subprime crisis. And they came up with a long list of candidates, from the homebuyers themselves (who should have been more prudent) to the SEC and the Federal Reserve (who should have been paying closer attention). Few disagree, though, that those promoting subprime mortgages—such as mortgage brokers and lenders—must bear at least a part of the blame.

Motivated by the potential to earn a lot of money in a rapidly expanding market, many of these players turned their backs on ethical standards. “In the feeding frenzy for housing loans,” according to one writer, “basic quality controls were ignored in the mortgage business, while the big Wall Street investment banks that backed these firms looked the other way.”4 Problems existed at many levels, as a few examples show:

Mortgage lenders did not adequately monitor what the mortgage brokers were doing. In fact, some allege that they were willing to make virtually any loan that brokers sent their way. With little oversight, the brokers did not have a strong incentive to carefully evaluate the ability of borrowers to repay the mortgages. They filled out the loan paperwork that they submitted to the lenders without verifying all of the information and, it has been alleged, in some cases actually misrepresented the facts.
Appraisers inflated the market value of houses, causing consumers to take out mortgages that did not reflect their houses’ true value. According to several national studies, lenders commonly pressured appraisers to value a property at whatever amount was needed to allow a high-priced sale to close.5 Willingness to inflate appraisals also made some appraisers attractive to unscrupulous mortgage brokers, who were an important source of their business. The attorneys general of several states filed suit against mortgage and appraisal firms, claiming that they engaged in this practice.
Mortgage companies lured buyers with teaser rates and other loan terms that appeared favorable but, in the longer run, were not. (Some have called these terms “toxic.”) Mortgage agreements often included prepayment penalties that would make it very expensive for buyers to refinance later. Many subprime buyers weren’t experienced or sophisticated enough to fully understand the terms, but lenders and brokers were interested in pushing through the loans—not in explaining the loan terms.
Many subprime mortgages were “no-doc” loans, which required little or no documentation of income. These loans, claimed one observer, “were available to anyone with a pulse.” Opportunities for abuse are obvious—and not restricted to borrowers. A former employee of Ameriquest Mortgage Corp. stated that it was “a common and open practice at Ameriquest for account executives to forge or alter borrower information or loan documents…. I saw account executives openly engage in conduct such as altering borrowers’ W-2 forms or pay stubs, photocopying borrower signatures and copying them onto other, unsigned documents, and similar conduct.”6
As bonds backed by subprime mortgages became more popular and profitable, investment banks—eager to bundle more mortgages—loosened their standards. The quality of the loans being bundled began to slide as the popularity of subprime mortgages grew, according to the consultants (called due-diligence firms) hired by the bankers to evaluate loan quality. However, many investment banking firms overlooked the problem—and, as a result, passed ever-higher risk along to the investors who bought their mortgage-backed securities.
Investors in the MBSs did not fully understand the risks associated with them. The way in which the mortgages were bundled made it difficult for investors to value the MBSs. They were so complex that many investors apparently relied on investment bankers to tell them what they were worth. The investment bankers apparently did not understand or simply failed to inform investors of all the risks. Some investors probably also got a bit greedy.
Discussion Questions
What were the responsibilities of the mortgage brokers to borrowers? To lenders? To investors? How well did they fulfill their responsibilities? Why?
Did some subprime lenders behave unethically? If so, how? Whose interests did the subprime lenders have a responsibility to represent? Did they adequately represent those interests?
What motivated the investment bankers to get involved in the subprime market? Did they behave appropriately? Why or why not?
Should the borrowers (homeowners) share in the blame? If so, how?
What about the investors in MBSs? What could they have done differently?
What can be done to prevent future blowups like the one that occurred in the subprime market?

Notes
1 If the bond sold at a premium, the reverse would be true; that is, the price with semiannual compounding would be slightly more than the price with annual compounding.
2 Notice that, for annual compounding, the yield to maturity equals the EAY; for the Eurobond, the yield to maturity = 3.17 percent and EAY = (1 + Quoted interest rate/m)m − 1 = (1 + 0.0317/1)1 − 1 = (1 + 0.0317) − 1 = 0.0317, or 3.17 percent.

CHAPTER 9
Stock Valuation
CHAPTER 9
Stock Valuation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

List and describe the four types of secondary markets.
Describe the two types of stock securities, and explain why many financial analysts treat preferred stock as a special type of bond rather than as an equity security.
Describe how expected future cash flows, discounted at the required rate of return, determine the value of common stock.
Describe how the general dividend-valuation model values a share of stock.
Discuss the assumptions that are necessary to make the general dividend-valuation model easier to use, and use the model to compute the value of a firm’s stock.
Explain why g must be less than R in the constant-growth dividend model.
Explain how valuing preferred stock with a stated maturity differs from valuing preferred stock with no maturity, and calculate the price of a share of preferred stock under both conditions.
Finding the actual market price of a share of publicly traded stock is easy. You can just look it up online at any number of Web sites, such as Yahoo! Finance or MSN Money Central. But don’t expect the market price to stay the same; stock prices change all the time—sometimes dramatically. For example, between the end of trading on August 31, 2020, and the end of trading on September 1, 2020, the price of Zoom Video Communications, Inc., stock surged from $325.10 to $447.69 per share—a 38 percent one-day gain! What caused the sharp increase in the company’s share price? Investors decided that the value of the cash flows that they could expect to receive from owning the video conferencing company’s shares was much higher than what they thought these cash flows were worth just one day before.

Investors did not arbitrarily increase their assessment of the value of the cash flows that Zoom shareholders could expect to receive. They changed their opinion when company management announced, on the evening of August 31, the earnings for the firm for the second quarter of the year. While analysts had expected the company to announce quarterly earnings of about $0.45, the company reported actual earnings of $0.92 on significantly higher revenue and improving margins. Comments from Zoom management also relayed their positive expectations for future subscriber growth into 2021. These comments, and the surprising performance of the company in the second quarter, heightened investors’ expectation for the company’s ability to generate higher future cash flows. The net effect of this new information was the 38 percent increase in the company’s stock price.

When stock prices rise or fall, how do investors or financial managers know when it is time to sell or buy? In other words, how can they tell if the market price of a stock reflects its true value? One approach is to develop a stock-valuation model and compare the value estimate from the model with the market price. If the market price is below the estimate, the stock may be undervalued, in which case an investor might decide to buy the stock. Alternatively, financial models can help inform an investor’s decision to sell a stock. In this chapter, we develop and apply stock-valuation models that enable us to estimate a stock’s value. These models are similar to those used in financial markets around the world.

Chapter Preview
This chapter focuses on equity securities (stocks) and how they are valued. We describe the market in which stocks trade and discuss several valuation models. These models tell us what a stock’s price should be. We can compare our estimates from such models with the actual market price to better understand how the market is valuing an individual stock.

Why are stock-valuation formulas important for you to study in a corporate finance course? First, management may want to know if the firm’s stock is undervalued or overvalued. This knowledge can affect the decisions that managers make. For example, if the stock is undervalued, management may want to repurchase shares of stock to reissue in the future or postpone an equity offering until the stock price increases. Second, as we mentioned in Chapter 1, the overarching goal of financial managers is to maximize the current value of the firm’s stock. To make investment or financing decisions that increase stockholder wealth, you must understand the fundamental factors that determine the market value of the firm’s stock.

We begin this chapter with a discussion of the secondary markets for stocks and their efficiency, describe the major U.S. stock market indexes, explain how to read stock market price quotes and related information, and introduce the types of equity securities that firms typically issue. We then develop a general valuation model and demonstrate that the value of a share of stock is the present value of all expected future cash dividends. We use some simplifying assumptions about dividend payments to implement this valuation model. These assumptions correspond to actual practice and allow us to develop several specific valuation models.

9.1 The Market for Stocks
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

List and describe the four types of secondary markets.
Equity securities, which represent an ownership interest in a corporation, are the most visible securities on the financial landscape. In December 2020, about $51 trillion worth of public equity securities were outstanding in the United States alone. Every day, Americans eagerly track the ups and downs of the stock market. Most people instinctively believe that the performance of the stock market is an important barometer of the country’s economic health. Also fueling interest is the large number of people who actually own equity securities through their pension or retirement plans. Today, more than half of U.S. households have some investment in the stock market.

Secondary Markets
Recall from Chapter 2 that the stock market consists of primary and secondary markets. In the primary market, firms sell new shares of stock to investors to raise money. In secondary markets, outstanding shares of stock are bought and sold among investors. We will discuss the primary markets for stocks further in Chapter 15. Our focus here is on secondary markets.

Any trade of a security after its primary offering is said to be a secondary market transaction. Most secondary market transactions do not directly affect the firm that issues the securities. For example, when an investor buys 100 shares of AT&T stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the exchange of money is only between the investors buying and selling the securities; no money flows into or out of AT&T.

The presence of a secondary market does, however, affect the issuer indirectly. As discussed in Chapter 2, investors will pay a higher price for primary securities that have an active secondary market. The reason is that, with an active secondary market, investors face lower transaction costs and are more likely to receive a price that reflects the true value of their securities when they sell them. As a result, firms whose securities trade on a secondary market can sell their new debt or equity issues at a lower cost than can firms selling similar securities that have no secondary market.

Major Secondary Markets
In the United States, most secondary market transactions take place on one of the many stock exchanges, the two most important being the NYSE and NASDAQ.

New York Stock Exchange

Chapter 2 described a traditional securities exchange as an organized market that provides a physical meeting place and communication facilities for members to buy and sell securities under a specific set of rules and regulations. The oldest, largest, and best-known exchange of this kind in the United States is the NYSE, which was founded in 1792. The exchange lists the common and preferred stocks of more than three thousand companies, as well as eight hundred bonds. Collectively, the companies whose securities are traded on the NYSE had a market capitalization (total stock value) of about $27 trillion in December 2020.

Stocks that are traded on an exchange are said to be listed on that exchange. For a firm’s stocks to be listed on an exchange, the firm must pay a fee and meet the exchange’s requirements for membership. Requirements include a minimum asset size, total stock value, a minimum number of shares of stock outstanding, and a minimum number of stockholders. Because of the prestige associated with being listed on the “big board,” as the NYSE is known, it has the most stringent listing requirements. As a result, companies listed on the NYSE tend to be large, well-known firms.

NASDAQ

The NASDAQ (pronounced “Naz-dak”) is the world’s largest electronic stock market, listing over three thousand companies. NASDAQ was created in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), and its odd name is an acronym for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) system.

NASDAQ is an over-the-counter, or OTC, market because it does not have a physical location where trading takes place. Nevertheless, NASDAQ has achieved the stature of a major exchange. In fact, thanks to its sophisticated electronic trading system, NASDAQ is the second-largest stock market in the world. The companies whose shares trade on NASDAQ had an aggregate market capitalization of $21.3 trillion in December 2020. Only the NYSE is larger.

The World’s Stock Exchanges/Markets

Although we have focused on the NYSE and NASDAQ, it is important to recognize that there are approximately 100 equity stock exchanges/markets located throughout the world. The NYSE and NASDAQ are the two largest exchanges based on the market value of the shares that trade in them. The largest exchanges/markets outside the United States in 2020 were the Japan Exchange Group, the Shanghai and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges, and Euronext Europe.

Over the last decade, there has been significant restructuring and consolidation of the exchanges and markets through mergers and acquisitions. Some examples are the purchase of Euronext by the NYSE, the merger of NASDAQ with the OMX Group, and the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange with the Chicago Board of Trade. The consolidation among the world’s major exchanges/markets is driven by (1) new technologies that provide faster executions of trades and access to more markets and more products, (2) increased competition, which has reduced profit margins, and (3) the need to increase size in order to achieve greater economies of scale and operational efficiencies.

Efficiency of Secondary Markets
The role of the NYSE, NASDAQ, and other secondary markets is to bring together buyers and sellers. Ideally, we would like them to do this as efficiently as possible. As discussed in Chapter 2, markets are efficient when the current market prices of securities that are trading reflect all available information relevant to the valuation of those securities. When this happens, security prices will be at or near their true (intrinsic) value. The more efficient the market, the more likely this is to happen.

There are four types of secondary markets, and each type differs according to the amount of price information available to investors, which in turn affects the efficiency of the market. We discuss the four types of secondary markets—direct search, broker, dealer, and auction—in the order from least to most efficient.

Direct Search

The secondary markets furthest from the ideal of complete availability of price information are those in which buyers and sellers must seek each other out directly. In these markets, individuals bear the full cost of locating and negotiating with a buyer or seller, and it is typically too costly for them to conduct a thorough search to locate the best price. Securities that sell in direct search markets are usually bought and sold so infrequently that few third parties, such as brokers or dealers, find it profitable enough to serve the market. In these markets, sellers often rely on word-of-mouth communication to find interested buyers. The common stock of small private companies is a good example of a security that trades in this manner.

Broker

When trading in a security issue becomes sufficiently heavy, brokers find it profitable to offer specialized search services to market participants. Brokers bring together buyers and sellers to earn a fee, called a commission. To provide investors with an incentive to hire them, brokers may charge a commission that is less than the cost of a direct search. Brokers are not passive agents but aggressively seek out buyers or sellers and try to negotiate an acceptable transaction price for their clients. The presence of active brokers increases market efficiency because brokers are in frequent contact with market participants and are likely to know what constitutes a fair price for a security.

Dealer

If the trading in a given security has sufficient volume, market efficiency is improved when there is someone in the marketplace who provides continuous bidding (selling or buying) for the security. Dealers do this by holding inventories of securities, which they own, and then buying and selling from the inventory to earn a profit. Unlike brokers, dealers have capital at risk. Dealers earn their profits from the spread on the securities they trade—the difference between their bid price (the price at which they buy) and their offer (ask) price (the price at which they sell). NASDAQ is the best-known example of a dealer market in the United States.

bid price the price a securities dealer will pay for a given stock

offer (ask) price the price at which a securities dealer seeks to sell a given stock

The advantage of a dealer over a broker market is that brokers cannot guarantee that an order to buy or sell will be executed promptly. This uncertainty about the speed of execution creates price risk. During the time a broker is trying to sell a security, its price may change and the person trying to sell the security could suffer a loss. A dealer market eliminates the need for time-consuming searches for a fair deal because buying and selling take place immediately from the dealer’s inventory of securities.

Dealers make markets in securities using electronic computer networks to quote prices at which they are willing to buy or sell a particular security. These networks enable dealers to electronically survey the prices quoted by different dealers to help establish their sense of a fair price and to trade. A major development in the 1990s was the opening of the so-called electronic communications network (ECN). An ECN is an electronic network that allows individual investors to trade securities directly with one another, much like dealers.

Auction

In an auction market, buyers and sellers interact directly with each other and bargain over price. The participants can communicate orally if they are located in the same place, or the information can be transmitted electronically. The NYSE is the best-known example of an auction market in the United States. In the NYSE, the auction for a security takes place at a specific location on the floor of the exchange, called a post. The auctioneer in this case is the specialist, who is designated by the exchange to represent orders placed by public customers. Specialists, as the name implies, specialize in orders for a small set of securities and are also allowed to act as dealers. Thus, in reality, the NYSE is an auction market that also has some features of a dealer market. Over the years, the NYSE has embraced electronic trading with the SuperDOT system (DOT stands for designated order turnaround), which allows orders to be transmitted electronically to specialists. While the NYSE still retains a physical trading floor on Wall Street in New York City, a significant proportion of its trades now occur through its data center in Mahwah, New Jersey.

Stock Market Indexes
Stock market indexes are used to measure the performance of the stock market—whether stock prices on average are moving up or down. The indexes are watched closely not only to track economic activity but also to measure the performance of specific firms. A wide variety of general and specialized indexes is available. Here, we discuss some of the better-known indexes.

Dow Jones Industrial Average. The most widely quoted stock market index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which was first published in 1896. The index consists of 30 companies that represent about 20 percent of the market value of all U.S. stocks. Dow Jones also publishes specialized indexes for industrial, transportation, and utility companies. These specialized indexes tell us how stocks in a particular segment of the economy are performing.
New York Stock Exchange Index. The NYSE composite index, published since 1966, includes all of the common and preferred stocks listed on the NYSE. This index provides information on the performance of many of the largest and most well-known firms in the U.S. economy.
Standard and Poor’s 500 Index. The Standard and Poor’s 500 Index was created in 1956 and is regarded as the best index for measuring the performance of the largest companies in the U.S. economy. In the past the index contained 500 stocks, but by early 2021 it included 505 stocks. The stocks in the S&P 500 are selected by the Standard and Poor’s Index Committee and represent more than 80 percent of the total market capitalization (market value) of all stocks traded in the United States.
NASDAQ Composite Index. The NASDAQ Composite Index consists of all of the common stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Currently, the index includes more than three thousand firms, many of which are in the technology sector of the economy. Thus, the NASDAQ Composite Index is considered a barometer of performance in the high-tech sector.
Reading Stock Market Quotes
Stock price quotes and other market information are readily available online at a number of reliable Web sites, such as Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, and CNBC, to name a few. Exhibit 9.1 provides an example of the stock quote data obtained from CNBC.com for the athletic apparel company Nike Inc., which trades on the NASDAQ exchange.

The first piece of information provided at the top of the page is the real-time price of the last trade for stock in Nike. Given the high frequency of trade for this stock, you will notice that this price changes constantly over the course of the trading day. The numbers just to the right of the stock price reflect the dollar and percentage change in the stock price relative to the previous day’s closing price. Further to the right in this row is the volume of shares traded during the current day and the highest and lowest price for the stock over the previous 52 weeks. At the moment this quote was obtained, Nike stock was trading for $141.63 per share, and 1,167,930 shares had been traded for the day.

EXHIBIT 9.1 Stock Quotes and Financial Data for Nike This exhibit features stock quotes and other financial market data for Nike Inc., provided by CNBC.com on February 11, 2021.


The “Key Stats” under the graph include the opening price from the first trade of the day, the day’s highest and lowest price, and the average daily volume of trading for the stock during the last 10 days. You will also see the $1.10 dividend per-share Nike paid out over the trailing (past) twelve months, abbreviated as “TTM,” and the associated dividend yield. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend per share by the current market price. For Nike, that calculation is $1.10/$141.63 = 0.0078, or 0.78 percent. Most firms pay no dividends and dividend yields can vary widely for the firms that do. You can read more about dividend policy in Chapter 17.

9.2 Common and Preferred Stock
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the two types of stock securities, and explain why many financial analysts treat preferred stock as a special type of bond rather than as an equity security.
Equity securities take several forms. The most prevalent type of equity security, as its name implies, is common stock. Common stock represents the basic ownership claim in a corporation. One of the basic rights of the owners is to vote on all important matters that affect the company, such as the election of the board of directors or a proposed merger or acquisition. Owners of common stock are not guaranteed any dividend payments and have the lowest-priority claim on the firm’s assets in the event of bankruptcy. Legally, common stockholders enjoy limited liability; that is, their losses are limited to the original amount of their investment in the firm, and their personal assets cannot be taken to satisfy the obligations of the corporation. Finally, common stocks are perpetuities in the sense that they have no maturity. Common stock can be retired only if management buys it in the open market from investors or if the firm is liquidated, in which case its assets are sold, as described in the next section.

common stock an equity share that represents the basic ownership claim in a corporation; the most common type of equity security

Like common stock, preferred stock represents an ownership interest in the corporation, but as the name implies, preferred stock receives preferential treatment over common stock. Specifically, preferred stockholders take precedence over common stockholders in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of corporate assets in the event of liquidation. Unlike the interest payments on bonds, which are contractual obligations, preferred stock dividends are declared by the board of directors, and if a dividend is not paid, the lack of payment is not legally viewed as a default.

preferred stock an equity share in a corporation that entitles the owner to preferred treatment over owners of common stock with respect to dividend payments and claims against the firm’s assets in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation, but that typically has no voting rights

Preferred stock is legally a form of equity. Thus, preferred stock dividends are paid by the issuer with after-tax dollars. Even though preferred stock is an equity security, the owners have no voting privileges unless the preferred stock is convertible into common stock. Preferred stocks are generally viewed as perpetuities because they have no maturity. However, most preferred stocks are not true perpetuities because their share contracts often contain call provisions, and can even include sinking fund provisions, which require management to retire (purchase) a certain percentage of the stock issue annually until the entire issue is retired.

An ongoing debate in finance is whether preferred stock is debt or equity. A strong case can be made that preferred stock is a special type of bond rather than equity. The argument behind this view is as follows. First, regular (nonconvertible) preferred stock confers no voting rights. Second, preferred stockholders receive a fixed dividend, regardless of the firm’s earnings, and if the firm is liquidated, they receive a stated value (usually par) and not a residual value. Third, preferred stocks often have credit ratings that are similar in nature to those issued for bonds. Fourth, preferred stock is sometimes convertible into common stock. Finally, most preferred stock issues have a retirement date and, thus, are not true perpetuities.

9.3 Common Stock Valuation
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe how expected future cash flows, discounted at the required rate of return, determine the value of common stock.
In earlier chapters we emphasized that the value of any asset is the present value of its future cash flows. The steps in valuing an asset are as follows:

Estimate the expected future cash flows.
Determine the required rate of return, or discount rate, which reflects the riskiness of the future cash flows.
Compute the present value of the future cash flows to determine what the asset is worth.
It is relatively straightforward to apply these steps in valuing a bond because the cash flows are stated as part of the bond contract and the required rate of return or discount rate is just the yield to maturity on bonds with comparable risk. However, common stock valuation is more difficult for several reasons. First, while the expected cash flows for bonds are well documented and easy to determine, common stock dividends are much less certain. Dividends are declared by the board of directors, and a board may or may not decide to pay a cash dividend at a particular time. Thus, the size and the timing of dividend cash flows are less certain. Second, common stocks are true perpetuities in that they have no final maturity date. Thus, firms never have to redeem them. In contrast, bonds have a finite maturity. Finally, unlike the rate of return, or yield, on bonds, the rate of return on common stock is not directly observable. Thus, grouping common stocks into risk classes is more difficult than grouping bonds. Keeping these complexities in mind, we now turn to a discussion of common stock valuation.

A One-Period Model
Let’s assume that you have a genie that can tell the future with perfect certainty. Also, suppose that you are thinking about buying a share of stock and selling it after a year. The genie volunteers that in one year the price (P1) for which you can sell the stock will be $100 and it will pay an $8 dividend (D1) at the end of the year. The time line for the transaction is:


If you and the other investors require a 20 percent return on investments in securities in this risk class, what price would you be willing to pay for the stock today?

The value of the stock is the present value of the future cash flows you can expect to receive from it. The cash flows you will receive are as follows: (1) the $8 dividend and (2) the $100 sale price. Using a 20 percent rate of return, we see that the value of the stock equals the present value (PV) of the dividend plus the present value of the cash received from the sale of the stock:

Thus, the value of the stock today is $90. If you pay $90 for the stock, you will have a one-year holding period return of exactly 20 percent. More formally, the time line and the current value of the stock for our one-period model can be shown as follows:


where:

P0	=	the current value, or price, of the stock
D1	=	dividend paid at the end of the period
P1	=	price of the stock at the end of the period
R	=	required return on common stock, or discount rate, in a particular risk class
Note that P0 denotes time zero, which is today; P1 is the price one period later; P2 is the price two periods in the future; and so on. Note also that when we speak of the price (Pt) in this context, we mean the value—what we have determined is what the price should be, given our model—not the actual market price. Our one-period model provides an estimate of what the market price should be.

Now, what if at the beginning of Year 2 we are again asked to determine the price of a share of common stock with the same dividend pattern and a one-year holding period. As in our first calculation, the current price (P1) of the stock is the present value of the dividend and the stock’s sale price, both received at the end of the year (P2). Specifically, our time line and the stock pricing formula are as follows:


If we repeat the process again at the beginning of Year 3, the result is similar:

and at the beginning of Year 4:

Each single-period model discounts the dividend and sale price at the end of the period by the required return.

A Perpetuity Model
Unfortunately, although our one-period model is correct, it is not very realistic. We need a stock-valuation formula for a perpetuity, not for one or two periods. However, we can string together a series of one-period stock pricing models to arrive at a stock perpetuity model. Here is how we do it.

First, we construct a two-period stock-valuation model. The time line for the two-period model is:


To construct our two-period model, we start with our initial single-period valuation model:

Now we substitute into this equation the expression derived earlier for P1 [P1 = (D2 + P2) /(1 + R)] and obtain the following:

Rearranging this equation results in a stock-valuation model for two periods:

Finally, we combine the second-period terms to obtain:

This equation shows that the price of a share of stock that is held for two periods is the present value of the dividend in period 1 (D1) plus the present value of the dividend and sale price of the stock in period 2 (D2 and P2).

Now let’s construct a three-period model. The time line for the three-period model is:


If we substitute the equation for P2 into the two-period valuation model shown above, we have a three-period model, which is as follows. Recall that P2 = (D3 + P3)/(1 + R).

By now, it should be clear that we could go on to develop a four-period model, a five-period model, a six-period model, and so on. The ultimate result is the following equation:

Here, t is the time period, which can be any number from one to infinity (∞). We will use t, instead of n, to denote the time period from this point forward because it is more commonly used in pricing equations; n will still be used to denote the number of periods.

In summary, we have developed a model showing that the value, or price, of a share of stock today (P0) is the present value of all future dividends and the stock’s sale price in the future. Although theoretically sound, this model is not practical to apply because the number of dividends could be infinite. It is unlikely that we can successfully forecast an infinite number of dividend payments or a stock’s sale price far into the future. What we need are some realistic simplifying assumptions.

9.4 The General Dividend-Valuation Model
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe how the general dividend-valuation model values a share of stock.
In the preceding equation, notice that the final term, as in the earlier stock valuation models, is always the sale price of the stock in period t (Pt) and that t can be any number, including infinity if we plan on holding the stock forever. The model assumes that we can forecast the sale price of the stock far into the future, which does not seem very likely in real life. However, as a practical matter, as Pt moves further out in time toward infinity, the value of the Pt approaches zero. Why? No matter how large the sale price of the stock, the present value of Pt will approach zero because the discount factor approaches zero. Therefore, if we go out to infinity, we can ignore the Pt/(1 + R)t term and write our final equation as:

(9.1)
where:

P0	=	the current value, or price, of the stock
Dt	=	the dividend received in period t, where t = 1, 2, 3, …, ∞
R	=	the required return on the common stock or discount rate
Equation 9.1 is a general expression for the value of a share of stock. It says that the price of a share of stock is the present value of all expected future dividends:

The formula does not assume any specific pattern for future dividends, such as a constant growth rate. Nor does it make any assumption about when the share of stock is going to be sold in the future. If we do decide to sell a share of stock in the near term, we can assume that the stock price will be equal to the present value of the future dividends at the date of the sale. Furthermore, the model says that to compute a stock’s current value, we need to forecast an infinite number of dividends, which is a daunting task.

Equation 9.1 provides some insights into why stock prices are changing all the time and why, at certain times, price changes can be dramatic. Equation 9.1 implies that the underlying value of a share of stock is determined by the market’s expectations of the future cash flows (from dividends) that the firm can generate. In efficient markets, stock prices change constantly as new information becomes available and is incorporated into the firm’s market price. For publicly traded companies, the market is inundated with new facts and rumors, such as when a firm unexpectedly fails to meet sales projections, the CEO resigns or is fired, or a class-action suit is filed against the firm because of a defect in one of its products. Some events may have little or no impact on the firm’s expected cash flows and, hence, its stock price. Others can have very large effects on expected cash flows. Examples include the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on lodging stocks, such as Hilton Worldwide, and the impact the grounding of the 737 MAX on the cash flows of Boeing in 2019.

The Growth Stock Pricing Paradox
An interesting issue concerning growth stocks arises out of the fact that the stock-valuation equation is based on dividend payments. Growth stocks are typically defined as the stocks of companies whose earnings are growing at above-average rates and are expected to continue to do so for some time. A company of this type typically pays little or no dividends on its stock because management believes that the company has a number of high-return investment opportunities and that both the company and its investors will be better off if earnings are reinvested rather than paid out as dividends.

To illustrate the problem with valuing growth stocks, let’s suppose that the earnings of Acme Corporation are growing at an exceptionally high rate. The company’s stock pays no dividends, and management states that there are no plans to pay any dividends. Based on our stock-valuation equation, what is the value of Acme’s stock?

Obviously, since all the dividend values are zero, the value of our growth stock is zero!

How can the value of a growth stock be zero? What is going on here?

The problem is that our definition of growth stocks was less than precise. Our application of Equation 9.1 assumes that Acme will never pay a dividend. If Acme had a charter that stated it would never pay dividends and would never liquidate itself (unless it went bankrupt), the value of its stock would indeed be zero. Equation 9.1 predicts and common sense says that if you own stock in a company that will never pay you any cash, the market value of those shares of stock are worth absolutely nothing. As you may recall, this is a point we emphasized in Chapter 1.

What we should have said is that a growth stock is stock in a company that currently has exceptional investment opportunities and thus is not currently paying dividends because it is reinvesting earnings. At some time in the future, growth stock companies will pay dividends or will liquidate themselves (for example, by selling out to other companies) and pay a single large cash dividend. People who buy growth stocks expect rapid price appreciation because management reinvests the cash flows from earnings internally in investment projects believed to have high rates of return. If the internal investments succeed, the stock’s price should go up significantly, and investors can sell their stock at a price that is higher than the price they paid.

9.5 Stock Valuation: Some Simplifying Assumptions
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss the assumptions that are necessary to make the general dividend-valuation model easier to use, and use the model to compute the value of a firm’s common stock.
Conceptually, the general dividend-valuation model (Equation 9.1) is consistent with the notion that the value of an asset is the discounted value of future cash flows. Unfortunately, at a practical level, the model is not easy to use because of the difficulty of estimating future dividends over a long period of time. We can, however, make some simplifying assumptions about the pattern of dividends that make the model more manageable. Fortunately, these assumptions closely resemble the way many firms manage their dividend payments. We have a choice among three different assumptions: (1) Dividends remain constant over time; that is, they have a growth rate of zero. (2) Dividends grow at a constant rate; for example, they grow at 3 percent per year. (3) Dividends exhibit a mixed growth rate pattern; that is, dividends have one growth pattern and then switch to another. We discuss each of these assumptions in turn.

Zero-Growth Dividend Model
The simplest assumption is that dividends will have a growth rate of zero. Thus, the dividend payment pattern remains constant over time:

In this case, the dividend-discount model (Equation 9.1) becomes:

This cash flow pattern is a perpetuity with a constant cash flow. You may recall that we developed an equation for such a perpetuity in Chapter 6. Equation 6.4 said that the present value of a perpetuity with a constant cash flow is CF/i, where CF is the constant cash flow and i is the interest rate. In terms of our stock-valuation model, we can present the same relation as follows:

(9.2)
where:

P0	=	the current value, or price, of the stock
D	=	the constant cash dividend received in each time period
R	=	the required return on the common stock or discount rate
This model fits the dividend pattern for common stock of a company that is not growing and has little growth potential or for preferred stock, which we discuss in the next section.

For example, the Del Mar Corporation is a small printing company that serves a rural three-county area near San Diego, California. The county’s economic base has remained constant over the years, and Del Mar’s sales and earnings reflect this trend. The firm pays a $5 dividend per year, and the board of directors has no plans to change the dividend. If the firm’s investors are mostly local businesspeople who expect a 20 percent return on their investment, what should be the price of the firm’s stock?

Since the cash dividend payments are constant, we can use Equation 9.2 to find the price of the stock:

Learning by Doing Application 9.1 illustrates use of Equation 9.2 in valuing the stock of another small business.

Constant-Growth Dividend Model
Under the constant-growth dividend assumption, cash dividends do not remain constant but instead grow at some average rate g from one period to the next forever. The rate of growth can be positive or negative. And, as it turns out, a constant growth rate is not a bad approximation of the actual dividend pattern for many firms. Constant dividend growth is often an appropriate assumption for mature companies with a history of stable growth.

You may have concerns about the assumption of an infinite time horizon. In practice, though, it does not present a problem. It is true that most companies do not live on forever. We know, however, that the further in the future a cash flow will occur, the smaller its present value. Thus, far-distant dividends have a small present value and contribute very little to the price of the stock. For example, as shown in Exhibit 9.2, with constant dividends and a 15 percent discount rate, dividends paid during the first 10 years account for more than 75 percent of the value of a share of stock, while dividends paid after the twentieth year contribute only about 6 percent of the value.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 9.1
The Value of a Small Business

Problem

For the past 15 years, a family has operated the gift shop in a luxury hotel near Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles. The hotel management wants to sell the gift shop to the family members rather than paying them to operate it. The family’s accountant will incorporate the new business and estimates that it will generate an annual cash dividend of $150,000 for the stockholders. The hotel will provide the family with an infinite guarantee for use of the space and a generous buyout plan in the unlikely event that the hotel closes its doors. The accountant estimates that a 20 percent discount rate is appropriate. What is the value of the stock?





Identifying and applying the constant-growth dividend model is fairly straightforward. First, we need a model that can be used to compute the value of a dividend payment for any future period. If we assume that cash dividends grow at a constant rate g from one period to the next, we can use the future value formula, Equation 5.1, to obtain such a model:

To apply this formula to dividend payments, we replace FVn with Dt, PV with D0, i with g, and n with t:

(9.3)
where:

Dt	=	dividend payment in period t, where t = 1, 2, 3, …, ∞
D0	=	dividend paid in the current period, t = 0
g	=	the constant growth rate for dividends
EXHIBIT 9.2 Impact on Stock Prices of Near and Distant Future Dividends Dividends expected far in the future have a smaller present value than dividends expected in the next few years, and so they have less effect on the price of the stock. As you can see in the exhibit, with constant dividends, more than 75 percent of the current price of a share of stock comes from expected dividends in the first 10 years.


Equation 9.3 allows us to compute the dividend payment for any time period. For example, the next dividend, paid at time t = 1, is D1, which is just the current dividend (D0) multiplied by the growth factor, (1 + g). Thus, D1 = D0 × (1 + g). Notice that to compute the dividend payment for any future period, we multiply D0 by the growth rate factor to some power, but we always start with D0.

We can now develop the constant-growth dividend model, which is easy to do because it is just an application of Equation 6.6 from Chapter 6. Equation 6.6 says that the present value of a growing perpetuity (PVP) equals the cash flow value from period 1 (CF1) divided by the difference between the discount rate (i) and the rate of growth (g) of the cash flow (CF1):

We can represent this same relation for stock valuation as follows:

(9.4)
where:

P0	=	the current value, or price, of the stock
D1	=	the dividend paid in the next period (t = 1)
g	=	the constant growth rate for dividends
R	=	the required return on the common stock or discount rate
In other words, the constant-growth dividend model tells us that the current price of a share of stock is the next period dividend divided by the difference between the discount rate and the dividend growth rate. Note that PVP is the current value of the stock (P0), which equals the present value of the dividend cash flows.

As discussed in Chapter 6, the growing-perpetuity model is valid only if the growth rate is less than the discount rate, or required rate of return. In terms of Equation 9.4, then, the value of g must be less than the value of R (g < R). If the equation is used in situations where R is equal to or less than g (R ≤ g), the computed results will be meaningless.

Finally, notice that if g = 0, there is no dividend growth and the dividend payment pattern is simply a constant no-growth dividend stream. In this case, Equation 9.4 becomes P0 = D/R, which is precisely the same as Equation 9.2, the zero-growth dividend model. Thus, Equation 9.2 is just a special case of Equation 9.4 where g = 0.

Let’s work through an example using the constant-growth dividend model. Big Red Automotive is a regional auto parts supplier based in Oklahoma City. At the firm’s year-end stockholders’ meeting, the CFO announces that this year’s dividend will be $4.81. The announcement conforms to Big Red’s dividend policy, which sets dividend growth at a 4 percent annual rate. Investors who own stock in similar types of firms expect to earn a return of 18 percent. What is the value of the firm’s stock?

First, we need to compute the cash dividend payment for next year (D1). Applying Equation 9.3 for t = 1 yields the following:

Next, we apply Equation 9.4 to compute the value of the firm’s stock, which is $35.71 per share:

Learning by Doing Application 9.2 illustrates another application of Equation 9.4 to the valuation of a firm’s stock.

Big Red Grows Faster

Problem

Using the information given in the text, compute the value of Big Red’s stock if dividends grow at 6 percent rather than 4 percent and the discount rate remains 18 percent. Explain why the answer makes sense.





Computing Future Stock Prices
The constant-growth dividend model (Equation 9.4) can be modified to determine the value, or price, of a share of stock at any point in time. In general, the price of a share of stock, Pt, can be expressed in terms of the dividend in the next period (Dt + 1), g, and R, when the dividends from Dt + 1 forward are expected to grow at a constant rate. Thus, the price of a share of stock at time t is as follows:

(9.5)
Notice that Equation 9.4 is just a special case of Equation 9.5 in which t = 0. To be sure that you understand this, set up Equation 9.5 to compute a stock’s current price at t = 0. When you are done, the resulting equation should look exactly like Equation 9.4.

An example will illustrate how Equation 9.5 is used. Suppose that a firm has a current dividend (D0) of $2.50, R is 15 percent, and g is 5 percent. What is the price of the stock today (P0), and what will it be in five years (P5)? To help visualize the problem, we will lay out a time line and identify some of the important variables necessary to solve the problem:


To find the current stock price, we can apply Equation 9.4, but we must first compute the dividend for the next period (D1), which is at t = 1. Using Equation 9.3, we compute the firm’s dividend for next year:

Now we can use Equation 9.4 to find the price of the stock today:

We next find the value of the stock in five years. In this situation, Equation 9.5 is expressed as:

We need to compute D6, and we do so by using Equation 9.3:

The price of the stock in five years is therefore:

Finally, note that $33.50/(1.05)5 = $26.25, which is the value today.

Learning by Doing Applications 9.3 and 9.4 illustrate additional examples of the use of Equations 9.3, 9.4, and 9.5 in stock valuation.

9.6 The Relation between R and g
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain why g must be less than R in the constant-growth dividend model.
We previously mentioned that the dividend growth model provides valid solutions only when g < R. Students frequently ask what happens to Equation 9.4 or 9.5 if this condition does not hold (if g ≥ R). Mathematically, as g approaches R, the stock price becomes larger and larger, and when g = R, the value of the stock is infinite, which is, of course, impossible. When the growth rate (g) is larger than the discount rate (R), the constant-growth dividend model tells us that the value of the stock is negative, but this is impossible. The value of a share of stock can never be less than zero because, as we discussed in Section 1.2, stockholders have limited liability.

Problem

Suppose that the current cash dividend on Procter & Gamble’s common stock is $1.84. Financial analysts expect the dividends to grow at a constant rate of 5 percent per year, and investors require an 8 percent return on stocks with the same level of risk. What should be the current price of a share of Procter & Gamble stock?





LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 9.4
Procter & Gamble’s Future Stock Price

Problem

Continuing the example in Learning by Doing Application 9.3, what should Procter & Gamble’s stock price be seven years from now (P7)?





From a practical perspective, the growth rate in the constant-growth dividend model cannot be greater than the sum of the long-term rate of inflation and the long-term real growth rate of the economy. Since this model assumes that the firm will grow at a constant rate forever, any growth rate that is greater than this sum would imply that the firm will eventually take over the entire economy. Of course, we know this is not possible. Eventually, competition and changes in consumer preferences will cause a decline in the growth rate. Since the sum of the long-term rate of inflation and the long-term real growth rate has historically been less than 6 to 7 percent, the growth rate (g) is virtually always less than the discount rate (R) for the stocks that we would want to use the constant-growth dividend model to value.

It is possible for firms to grow faster than the long-term rate of inflation plus the real growth rate of the economy—just not forever. A firm that is growing at such a high rate is said to be growing at a supernormal growth rate. We must use a different model to value the stock of a firm like this. We discuss one such model next.

Mixed (Supernormal) Growth Dividend Model
For many firms, it is not appropriate to assume that dividends will grow at a constant rate. Firms typically go through life cycles and, as a result, exhibit different dividend patterns over time.

During the early part of their lives, successful firms experience a supernormal rate of growth in earnings. These firms tend to pay lower dividends or no dividends at all because many good investment projects are available to them and management wants to reinvest earnings in the firm to take advantage of these opportunities. If a growth firm does not pay regular dividends, investors receive their returns from capital appreciation of the firm’s stock (which reflects increases in expected future dividends), from a cash or stock payout if the firm is acquired, or possibly from a large special cash dividend. As a firm matures, it will settle into a growth rate at or below the long-term rate of inflation plus the long-term real growth rate of the economy. When a firm reaches this stage, it will often be paying a fairly predictable regular dividend.

Exhibit 9.3 shows several dividend growth patterns. In the top curve, dividends exhibit a supernormal growth rate of 25 percent for four years, then a more sustainable nominal growth rate of 5 percent (this might, for example, be made up of 2.5 percent growth from inflation plus a 2.5 percent real growth rate). By comparison, the remaining curves show dividends with a constant nominal growth rate of 5 percent, a zero growth rate, and a negative 10 percent growth rate. In addition to the constant growth rates illustrated in Exhibit 9.3, it is also possible for the dividend growth rate to vary during the early years. We refer to this as a mixed dividend growth pattern.

EXHIBIT 9.3 Dividend Growth Rate Patterns This exhibit shows dividend growth patterns including supernormal growth, constant growth, zero growth, and negative growth.


As mentioned earlier, successful companies often experience supernormal growth early in their life cycles. During the last decade, for example, firms such as Google, Facebook, and Netflix have experienced supernormal growth. Older companies that reinvent themselves with new products or strategies may also experience periods of supernormal growth. In the early 2000s, Apple Inc. management repositioned the company from being primarily a manufacturer of computers to being a firm that is now also a market leader in the smartphone and computing hardware segments, mobile payments, the distribution of third-party digital content, and applications. Following this restructuring, Apple’s stock generated huge returns for investors, rising from approximately $7.50 per share at the beginning of 2010 to $132 per share at the end of 2020.

To value a share of stock for a firm with a mixed (supernormal) dividend growth pattern, we do not have to develop any new equations. Instead, we can apply Equation 9.1, our general dividend model, and Equation 9.5, which gives us the price of a share of stock with constant dividend growth at any point in time.

We will illustrate with an example. Suppose a company’s expected dividend pattern for three years is as follows: D1 = $1, D2 = $2, D3 = $3. After three years, the dividends are expected to grow at a constant rate of 6 percent a year. What should the current price (P0) of the firm’s stock be if the required rate of return demanded by investors is 15 percent?

We begin by drawing a time line, as shown in Exhibit 9.4. We recommend that you prepare a time line whenever you solve a problem with a complex dividend pattern so that you can be sure the cash flows are placed in the proper time periods. The critical elements in working these problems are to correctly identify when the constant growth starts and to value it properly.

Looking at Exhibit 9.4, it is easy to see that we have two different dividend patterns: (1) D1 through D3 represent a mixed dividend growth pattern, which can be valued using Equation 9.1, the general dividend-valuation model. (2) After the third year, dividends grow at a constant rate of 6 percent and can be valued using Equation 9.5, the constant-growth dividend-valuation model. Thus, our valuation model is:

Combining these present values yields the following formula:


The value of the constant-growth dividend stream is P3, which is the value, or price, at time t = 3. More specifically, P3 is the value of the future cash dividends discounted to time period t = 3. With a required rate of return of 15%, the value of these dividends is calculated as follows:

EXHIBIT 9.4 Time Line for Nonconstant Dividend Growth Pattern The exhibit shows a time line for a nonconstant dividend growth pattern. The time line makes it easy to see that we have two different dividend growth patterns. For three years, the dividends are expected to grow at a mixed rate; after that, they are expected to grow at a constant rate of 6 percent.


We find the value of P3 using Equation 9.5, which allows us to compute stock prices in the future for stocks with constant dividend growth. Note that the equation gives us the value, as of Year 3, of a constant-growth perpetuity that begins in Year 4. This formula always gives us the value as of one period before the first cash flow.

Now, since P3 is at time period t = 3, we must discount it back to the present (t = 0). This is accomplished by dividing P3 by (1 + R)3.

Plugging the values for the dividends, P3, and R into the mixed-growth equation presented earlier results in the following:

Thus, the value of the stock is $27.58 per share.

We can write a general equation for the mixed (supernormal) growth situation, where dividends grow first at a mixed or high constant rate until period t, and then at a constant rate thereafter, as follows:

(9.6)
If the mixed- or high-growth period ends and dividends grow at a constant rate, g, then Pt can be calculated using Equation 9.5:

The two preceding equations can also be applied when dividends are constant over time, since we know that g = 0 is just a special case of the constant-growth dividend model (g > 0).

Let’s look at another example, this time using Equation 9.6. Suppose that Redteck is a high-tech medical device firm located in Lincoln, Nebraska. The company is three years old and has experienced spectacular growth since its inception. You are a financial analyst for a stock brokerage firm and have just returned from a two-day visit to the company. You learned that Redteck plans to pay no dividends for the next five years. In Year 6, management plans to pay a large, special cash dividend, which you estimate to be $25 per share. Then, beginning in Year 7, management plans to pay a constant annual dividend of $6 per share for the foreseeable future. The appropriate discount rate for the stock is 12 percent, and the current market price is $24 per share. Your boss doesn’t think the stock is worth the price. You think that it’s a bargain and that you should recommend it to the firm’s clients. Who is right?

Our first step in answering this question is to lay out the expected dividend payments on a time line:


Equation 9.6, the mixed (supernormal) dividend model, can be used to determine the value of the stock. There are two different dividend cash streams: (1) the mixed dividends, which in this case comprise a single dividend paid in Year 6 (Equation 9.1), and (2) the constant dividend stream (g = 0) of $6 per year forever (Equation 9.5). The value of the common stock can be computed as follows:

Applying Equation 9.6 to the cash flows presented in the problem yields:

Note that the first term in the second line computes the present value of the large $25 dividend paid in Year 6. In the second term, P6 is the discounted value of the constant $6 dividend payments made in perpetuity, as of period t = 6. To compute the present value of P6, we divide it by the appropriate discount factor, which is (1 + R)6.

Plugging the data given earlier into the above equation yields:

We can see from this relation that we still need to compute the value of P6 using Equation 9.5:

Equation 9.5 is easy to apply since the dividend payments remain constant over time. Since Dt + 1 = $6 and g = 0, P6 is calculated as follows:

and the calculation for P0 is therefore:

The stock’s current market price is $24, and if your estimates of dividend payments are correct, the stock’s value is $38 per share. This suggests that the stock is a bargain and that your boss is incorrect.

9.7 Valuing Preferred Stock
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain how valuing preferred stock with a stated maturity differs from valuing preferred stock with no maturity, and calculate the price of a share of preferred stock under both conditions.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, preferred stocks are hybrid securities, falling someplace between bonds and common stock. For example, preferred stock has a higher-priority claim on the firm’s assets than common stock but a lower-priority claim than the firm’s creditors in the event of default. In computing the value of preferred stock, however, the critical issue is whether the preferred stock has a fixed maturity. If the preferred stock contract has a sinking fund that calls for the mandatory retirement of the stock over a scheduled period of time, financial analysts will tend to treat the stock as if it were a bond with a fixed maturity.

The most significant difference between preferred stock with a fixed maturity and a bond is the risk of default. Bond coupon payments are a legal obligation of the firm, and failure to pay them results in default, whereas preferred stock dividends are declared by the board of directors, and failure to pay dividends does not result in default. Even though it is not a legal default, the failure to pay a preferred stock dividend as promised is not a trivial event. It is a noteworthy financial breach which can signal to the market that the firm is in serious financial difficulty. As a result, managers make every effort to pay preferred stock dividends as promised.

Preferred Stock with a Fixed Maturity
Because preferred stock with a fixed maturity is considered similar to a bond, we can use the bond valuation model developed in Chapter 8 to determine its price, or value. Applying Equation 8.2 requires only that we recognize that the coupon payments (C) are equivalent to dividend payments (D) and the preferred stock dividends are paid quarterly. Thus, Equation 8.2 can be restated as the price of a share of preferred stock (PS0):

(9.7)
where:

D	=	the annual preferred stock dividend payment
P	=	the stated (par) value of the preferred stock
i	=	the yield to maturity of the preferred stock
m	=	the number of times dividend payments are made each year
n	=	the number of years to maturity
For preferred stock with quarterly dividend payments, m equals 4.

Consider an example of how this equation is used. Suppose that a utility company’s preferred stock has an annual dividend payment of $10 (paid quarterly), a stated (par) value of $100, and a maturity of 20 years owing to a sinking fund requirement. If similar preferred stock issues have market yields of 8 percent, what is the value of the preferred stock?

First, we convert the data to quarterly compounding as follows: (1) the market yield is 2 percent quarterly (8 percent per year/4 quarters per year = 2 percent per quarter), (2) the dividend payment is $2.50 quarterly ($10 per year/4 quarters per year = $2.50 per quarter), and (3) the total number of dividend payments is 80 (4 payments per year × 20 years = 80 payments). Plugging the data into Equation 9.7, we find that the value of the preferred stock is:

We can, of course, also solve this problem on a financial calculator. The keystrokes are as follows:


Learning by Doing Application 9.5 illustrates how Equation 9.7 or a calculator can be used to compute the yield to maturity of preferred stock.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 9.5
Computing the Yield on Preferred Stock

Problem

Phoenix Gas and Electric (PG&E) has a preferred stock issue outstanding that has a stated value of $100, will be retired by the company in 15 years, and pays a $2 dividend each quarter. If the preferred stock is currently selling for $95, what is the stock’s yield to maturity?





Preferred Stock with No Maturity
Some preferred stock issues have no maturity. These securities have dividends that are constant over time (g = 0) and that go on forever. Thus, these preferred stocks can be valued as perpetuities, using Equation 9.2:

where D is a constant cash dividend and R is the discount rate, or required rate of return.

Let’s work an example. Suppose that Ajax Air Lines has a perpetual preferred stock issue that pays a dividend of $5 per year and that investors require an 8 percent return on such an investment. What is the value of the preferred stock? Applying Equation 9.2, we find that the value is:

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 List and describe the four types of secondary markets.

The four types of secondary markets are (1) direct search, (2) broker, (3) dealer, and (4) auction. In direct search markets, buyers and sellers seek out each other directly. In broker markets, brokers bring together buyers and sellers for a fee. Trades in dealer markets go through dealers, who buy securities at one price and sell at a higher price. The dealers face the risk that prices could decline while they own the securities. Auction markets have a fixed location where buyers and sellers deal with each other directly and bargain over the transaction price.

2 Describe the two types of stock securities, and explain why many financial analysts treat preferred stock as a special type of bond rather than as an equity security.

Common stock represents the basic ownership claim in a corporation and allows owners to vote on all important corporate matters. Owners of common stock are not guaranteed any dividend payments and have the lowest priority claim on the firm’s assets in the event of bankruptcy. Preferred stock represents ownership in a corporation and entitles the owner to a dividend, which must be paid before dividends are paid to common stockholders. Similar to bonds, preferred stock issues have credit ratings, are sometimes convertible to common stock, and are often callable. Unlike owners of common stock, owners of nonconvertible preferred stock do not have voting rights and do not participate in the firm’s profits beyond the fixed dividends they receive. It is because of their strong similarity to bonds that many financial analysts treat preferred stocks that are not true perpetuities as a form of debt rather than equity.

3 Describe how expected future cash flows, discounted at the required rate of return, determine the value of common stock.

The value of common stock depends on the expected future cash flows and the rate of return, or discount rate. A share of stock is worth the present value of all of its expected future flows when discounted at the rate of return required by investors for investments with a similar level of risk. One-period models and perpetuity models are starting points for understanding how to value common stock.

4 Describe how the general dividend-valuation model values a share of stock.

The general dividend-valuation model values a share of stock as the present value of all future cash dividend payments, where the dividend payments are discounted using the rate of return required by investors for investments with a similar level of risk.

5 Discuss the assumptions that are necessary to make the general dividend-valuation model easier to use, and use the model to compute the value of a firm’s common stock.

The problems with the general dividend-valuation model are that future dividends are uncertain and that some companies do not pay dividends at all. To make the model easier to apply, we make assumptions about the dividend payment patterns of firms. These assumptions allow the development of more manageable models, and they also conform with the actual dividend policies of many firms. Dividend patterns include the following: (1) Dividends are constant (zero growth), as computed in Learning by Doing Application 9.1. (2) Dividends have a constant-growth pattern (they grow forever at a constant rate g), as computed in Learning by Doing Application 9.2. (3) Dividends grow first at a nonconstant rate rather than at a constant rate, as shown in Exhibit 9.4.

6 Explain why g must be less than R in the constant-growth dividend model.

The constant-growth dividend model assumes that dividends will grow at a constant rate forever. With the constant-growth model, if g = R, the value of the denominator is zero and the value of the stock is infinite, which of course is nonsense. If g > R, the value of the denominator is negative, as is the value of the stock, which also does not make economic sense, since stockholders have limited liability. Thus, g must always be less than R (g < R).

7 Explain how valuing preferred stock with a stated maturity differs from valuing preferred stock with no maturity, and calculate the price of a share of preferred stock under both conditions.

When preferred stock has a stated maturity, financial analysts value it as they value any other fixed obligation—that is, as they value a bond. To value such preferred stock, we can use the bond valuation model from Chapter 8. Before using the model, we need to recognize that we will be using dividends in the place of coupon payments and that the stated (par) value of the preferred stock will replace the par value of the bond. In addition, while bond coupons are paid semiannually in the United States, preferred stock dividends are paid quarterly. When a preferred stock has no stated maturity, it becomes a perpetuity, with the dividend becoming a constant payment that goes on forever. We use the perpetuity valuation model represented by Equation 9.2 to price such stocks. The calculations appear in Learning by Doing Application 9.5 and the Ajax Air Lines example at the end of Section 9.7.

Ethics Case
Insider Trading: Have I Got a Stock Tip for You!
Everyone would like to get a stock tip that will yield a huge return on a small investment. That’s human nature. But stock tips can be mixed blessings. Consider the following example: Dr. Sam Waksal developed a promising cancer drug called Erbitux. As the CEO of ImClone, Waksal was an entrepreneur as well as an immunologist. Waksal sold an interest in Erbitux to the pharmaceutical company Bristol Myers for $42 million.


Martha Stewart leaves the U.S. District Court in Manhattan in 2004
It was a Bristol Myers executive who informed Waksal that the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) was not going to approve the drug because there were insufficient data to determine its effectiveness; thus, new clinical trials were needed. Investors had expected approval, and once the FDA decision was made public, ImClone stock was certain to face a sharp decline in price. At least in the short term, some people were going to lose a lot of money.

One of those people was, of course, Waksal himself. He had millions of shares of ImClone. So did his family. Waksal told his daughter and father to sell their shares. In addition, Waksal transferred 79,000 of his own shares to his daughter to sell. Waksal knew that it was illegal under federal law for him or his family members to trade on inside information. And in the end, all three were indicted and later convicted of violating federal security laws.

Waksal was guilty of insider trading. As we pointed out in Chapter 1, insider trading results from information asymmetry, which arises when one party in a business transaction has information that is unavailable to the other parties in the transaction. To be legally actionable, insider trading must involve information that has not been publicly announced, as you might expect. In addition, the information must be material. Material means that the information will cause a significant change in the stock price—the price will go either up or down as a result of the event the information concerns. Examples of material corporate events include the introduction of a new product line, an acquisition, a divestiture, a key executive appointment, and the failure or success of a product under development.

Martha Stewart Enters the Picture

Waksal’s conviction is not the only part of this story. Waksal was friends with the celebrity Martha Stewart, who also owned ImClone stock. On the day before the negative FDA announcement, Stewart sold 4,000 shares of ImClone worth $230,000. Did Stewart sell her shares on the basis of inside information regarding the FDA decision? Stewart’s sale certainly looked suspicious, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started an investigation and asked her to explain her sale. In her discussions with the SEC, Stewart did not admit to insider trading.

Stewart claimed that she had a prearranged order in place to sell her ImClone stock when it dipped below $60 per share. The stock did dip below $60 the day before the FDA announcement. Federal prosecutors, however, alleged that she and her broker, Peter Bacanovic, had doctored stock transaction records to support her story. In the SEC indictment, it was clear that they did not believe her explanation.

It is also interesting to note that Stewart is not alleged to have received a tip from Waksal himself. Indeed, she contacted Waksal only after the sale, when she called him to ask what was happening to the company. However, it is alleged that her broker, Bacanovic, received a tip that Waksal and his daughter had placed orders to sell shares of ImClone.

Martha Stewart was eventually convicted in a criminal trial, but convicted of what? The most serious charges, which involved securities fraud and insider trading, were thrown out of court. She was convicted only of lying to investigators. However, Stewart was also charged in a civil suit, and in that suit the insider trading charge would have been allowed in court. After serving a jail term, Stewart eventually reached an agreement with the SEC to settle the insider trading accusations. Under the agreement, she had to pay $195,000, covering her gains from the trading and penalties, although she did not admit to any wrongdoing.

Conclusions

What can we conclude about insider trading? The ethical issues can be analyzed at two levels: At the institutional level, we can ask whether the insider trading laws are ethical. At the individual level, we can ask why a person would engage in this illegal behavior.

Institutional Level. Fairness is the ethical basis of the insider trading laws. If the competitive system is to work, it must operate on an even playing field. If insiders have material financial information not available to the public, then the playing field is not level. Note what the SEC said in its press release: “It is fundamentally unfair for someone to have an edge on the market just because she has a stock broker who is willing to break the rules and give her an illegal tip. It’s worse still when the individual engaging in the insider trading is the Chairman and CEO of a public company.” However, not everyone is convinced by this argument. Using a utilitarian framework, others argue that persons acting on insider information bring information to the market more quickly and thus make the market more efficient for the benefit of all.

Both sides have a point. One of the keystone propositions of efficient financial markets is that no participant should possess a significant unfair advantage over others. If you believe that the deck of cards is stacked against you and that some people who trade have access to inside information, you will collect your money and invest it elsewhere. Conversely, without inside information, there would be little reason for trading securities. Unless you know some information that affects securities’ prices that others do not know, why trade? Furthermore, how would information relevant to security prices be released to the market unless some traded on that information?

The bottom line is that too much or too little inside information trading seems to be detrimental to financial markets. The critical question is how much inside information is optimal. There is no consensus among economists on an answer.

Individual Level. At the individual level, we must evaluate the motivation of the inside traders. Waksal, for example, knew that insider trading was illegal. Why did he do it? In an interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes, Waksal admitted that he did not think that he would get caught. Investigation showed that Waksal had been guilty of a number of ethical lapses in his life. He had been dismissed from a number of academic and research positions for questionable conduct. Aristotle would say he had a weak character. If Stewart had not tried to obscure what she did and simply told the truth to investigators, most legal experts are convinced she would not have been convicted of anything.

Discussion Questions
Discuss whether it would be unethical to buy a stock based on some information you found in the trash that had been thrown away by mistake.
Suppose you are the printer who has been given the job of preparing the official announcement of the FDA report. Can you use that information for personal gain? Why or why not?
Some argue that insider trading brings information to the market more quickly and thus is morally acceptable on the grounds of efficiency. Do you agree with that argument? Why or why not?

In February 2020, managers of SK Hynix Inc., one of the largest manufacturers of memory chips in the world, reported that the company would cut its investment in new projects considerably from its recent expenditures of $10.6 billion and $21.4 billion in 2019 and 2018 respectively. This included cutting back on projects such as additions to capacity, upgrades at existing plants, and maintenance, resulting in investments of just $7.5 billion by the third quarter of the year. In October 2020, however, SK Hynix management changed course, announcing that the company had agreed to spend an additional $9 billion to buy Intel’s NAND SSD business. These sorts of major capital expenditures at manufacturing companies like SK Hynix are typically part of the firm’s long-term, ongoing capital investment program that are designed to create value.

Managers at SK Hynix had decided that the time was right to increase their NAND flash manufacturing operations, expand their storage solutions business, and further position themselves for growth in the semiconductor industry. NAND flash memory is a type of nonvolatile storage technology that does not require power to retain data, while NAND SSD is a type of solid-state drive that uses the NAND memory for storage. Managers apparently believed that the investment in these products was necessary to pursue the company’s business strategy.

The decision to spend so much money on the expansion of the firm’s operations in a single deal was undoubtedly based on a careful review of the firm’s business strategy and detailed analyses of the alternative investments that would best help SK Hynix achieve this strategy. Firms in capital-intensive industries, such as memory chip and storage manufacturing, continually evaluate their capabilities in light of their strategic goals, what their competitors are doing, and the economic environment in which they are competing. In addition, companies evaluate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations when making their investment decisions. At SK Hynix this includes a focus on reducing carbon emissions and water waste, establishing a culture of diversity and inclusion for employees, and addressing issues important to the company’s suppliers and local communities. The capital budgeting process, through which firms decide which real assets to invest in, is an integral element of these evaluations.

While few companies have capital expenditure programs as large as those at SK Hynix, all companies must routinely invest capital in projects that are critical to their success. Whether large or small, all investment opportunities must be carefully scrutinized, and their costs and benefits carefully weighed. How do firms make these important capital budgeting decisions? In this chapter we examine this decision-making process and introduce some financial models used to make investment decisions.

Chapter Preview
This chapter is about capital budgeting, a topic we first visited in Chapter 1. Capital budgeting is the process of deciding which capital investments the firm should make.

We begin the chapter with a discussion of the types of capital projects that firms undertake and how the capital budgeting process is managed within the firm. When making capital investment decisions, management’s goal is to select projects that will increase the value of the firm.

Next we examine some of the techniques used to evaluate capital budgeting decisions. We first discuss the net present value (NPV) method, which is the capital budgeting approach recommended in this book. The NPV method takes into account the time value of money and provides a direct measure of how much a capital project will increase the value of the firm.

We then examine the payback method and the accounting rate of return. As methods of selecting capital projects, both of these have some serious deficiencies. We also discuss the internal rate of return (IRR), which is the expected rate of return for a capital project when the project’s NPV is equal to zero. The IRR is a very popular and important alternative to the NPV technique. However, in certain circumstances, the IRR can lead to incorrect decisions.

After discussing the above commonly used methods for selecting individual projects, we turn to the methods that financial managers use to select projects when there is not enough money to invest in all of the attractive ones. Finally, we present evidence on which techniques financial managers actually use when making capital budgeting decisions.

10.1 An Introduction to Capital Budgeting
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss why capital budgeting decisions are the most important investment decisions made by a firm’s management.
We begin with an overview of capital budgeting, followed by a discussion of some important concepts you will need to understand in this and later chapters.

The Importance of Capital Budgeting
Capital budgeting decisions are the most important investment decisions made by management. The objective of these decisions is to select investments in productive assets that will increase the value of the firm. These investments create value when they are worth more than they cost. Capital investments are important because they can involve substantial cash outlays and, once made, are not easily reversed. They also define what the company is all about—the firm’s lines of business and its inherent business risk. For better or worse, capital investments produce most of a typical firm’s revenues for years to come.

capital budgeting the process of choosing the productive assets in which the firm will invest

Capital budgeting techniques help management systematically analyze potential business opportunities in order to decide which are worth undertaking. As you will see, not all capital budgeting techniques are equal. The best techniques are those that determine the value of a capital project by discounting all of the cash flows generated by the project and thus account for the time value of money.

In the final analysis, capital budgeting is really about management’s search for the best capital projects—those that add the greatest value to the firm. Over the long term, the most successful firms are those whose managements consistently search for and find capital investment opportunities that increase firm value.

The Capital Budgeting Process
The capital budgeting process starts with a firm’s strategic plan, which spells out its strategy for the next three to five years. Division managers then convert the firm’s strategic objectives into business plans. These plans have a one- to two-year time horizon, provide a detailed description of what each division should accomplish during the period covered by the plan, and have quantifiable targets that each division is expected to achieve. Behind each division’s business plan is a capital budget that details the resources management believes it needs to get the job done.

The capital budget is generally prepared jointly by the CFO’s staff and financial staffs at the divisional and lower levels and reflects, in large part, the activities outlined in the divisional business plans. Many of these proposed expenditures are routine in nature, such as the repair or purchase of new equipment at existing facilities. Less frequently, firms face broader strategic decisions, such as whether to launch a new product, build a new plant, enter a new market, or buy a business. Exhibit 10.1 identifies some reasons that firms initiate capital projects.

EXHIBIT 10.1 Key Reasons for Making Capital Expenditures

Capital budgeting decisions are the most important investment decisions made by management. Many of these decisions are routine in nature, but from time to time, managers face broader strategic decisions that call for significant capital investments.

Reason	Description
Renewal	Over time, equipment must be repaired, overhauled, rebuilt, or retrofitted with new technology to keep the firm’s manufacturing or service operations going. For example, a company that has a fleet of delivery trucks may decide to overhaul the trucks and their engines rather than purchase new trucks. Renewal decisions typically do not require an elaborate analysis and are made on a routine basis.
Replacement	At some point, an asset will have to be replaced rather than repaired or overhauled. The major decision is whether to replace the asset with a similar piece of equipment or purchase equipment that would require a change in the production process. Sometimes, replacement decisions involve equipment that is operating satisfactorily but has become obsolete. The new or retrofitted equipment may provide cost savings with respect to labor or material usage and/or may improve product quality. These decisions typically originate at the plant level.
Expansion	Strategically, the most important motive for capital expenditures is to expand the level of operating output. One type of expansion decision involves increasing the output of existing products. This may mean new equipment to produce more products or expansion of the firm’s distribution system. These types of decisions typically require a more complex analysis than a renewal or replacement decision. Another type of expansion decision involves producing a new product or entering a new market. This type of expansion often involves large dollar amounts and significant business risk and requires the approval of the firm’s board of directors.
Regulatory	Some capital expenditures are required by federal and state regulations. These mandatory expenditures usually involve meeting workplace safety standards and environmental standards.
Other	This category includes items such as parking facilities, office buildings, and executive aircraft. Many of these capital expenditures are hard to analyze because it is difficult to estimate their cash inflows. Ultimately, the decisions can be more subjective than analytical.
Sources of Information
Where does management get all of the information it needs to make capital budgeting decisions? Most of the information is generated within the firm, and, for expansion decisions, it often starts with sales representatives and marketing managers who are in the marketplace talking to potential and current customers on a day-to-day basis. For example, a sales manager with a new product idea might present the idea to management. If the product looks promising, the firm’s marketing research group will estimate the size of the market and a market price. If the product requires new technology, the firm’s research and development group must decide whether to develop the technology or to buy it. Next, cost accountants and production engineers will determine the cost of producing the product and any capital expenditures necessary to manufacture it. Finally, the CFO’s staff will take the data and estimate the total cost of the project and the cash flows it will generate over time. The project is a viable candidate for the capital budget if the present value of the expected cash flows exceeds the present value of the project’s cost.

Classification of Investment Projects
Potential capital budgeting projects can be classified into three types: (1) independent projects, (2) mutually exclusive projects, and (3) contingent projects.

Independent Projects

Projects are independent when their cash flows are unrelated. With independent projects, accepting or rejecting one project does not eliminate other projects from consideration (assuming the firm has unlimited funds to invest). For example, suppose a firm has unlimited funding and management wants to (1) build a new parking ramp at its headquarters; (2) acquire a small competitor; and (3) add manufacturing capacity to one of its plants. Since the projects’ cash flows are unrelated, accepting or rejecting one of the projects will have no effect on the others.

independent projects projects whose cash flows are unrelated

Mutually Exclusive Projects

When projects are mutually exclusive, acceptance of one project precludes acceptance of others. Typically, mutually exclusive projects perform the same function, and thus only one project needs to be accepted. For example, when BMW decided to manufacture automobiles in the United States, it considered three possible manufacturing sites (or capital projects). Once BMW management selected the Spartanburg, South Carolina, site, the other two possible locations were out of the running. Since some projects are mutually exclusive, it is very important that a capital budgeting method allow us to choose the best project when we are faced with two or more alternatives.

mutually exclusive projects projects for which acceptance of one precludes acceptance of the other

Contingent Projects

With contingent projects, the acceptance of one project is contingent on the acceptance of another. There are two types of contingency situations. In the first type of situation, the contingent product is mandatory. For example, when a public utility company (such as your local electric company) builds a power plant, it must also invest in suitable pollution control equipment to meet federal environmental standards. The pollution control investment is a mandatory contingent project. When faced with mandatory contingent projects, it is best to treat all of the projects as a single investment for the purpose of evaluation. This provides management with the best measure of the value created by these projects.

contingent projects projects whose acceptance depends on the acceptance of other projects

In the second type of situation, the contingent project is optional. For example, suppose Lenovo invests in a new computer for the home market. This computer has a feature that allows Lenovo to bundle a proprietary gaming system. The gaming system is a contingent project but is an optional add-on to the new computer. In these situations, the optional contingent project should be evaluated independently and should be accepted or rejected on its own merits.

Basic Capital Budgeting Terms
In this section we briefly introduce two terms that you will need to be familiar with—cost of capital and capital rationing.

Cost of Capital

The cost of capital is the rate of return that a capital project must earn to be accepted by management. The cost of capital can be thought of as an opportunity cost. Recall from Chapter 8 that an opportunity cost is the value of the most valuable alternative given up if a particular investment is made.

cost of capital the required rate of return for a capital investment

Building Intuition
Investment Decisions Have Opportunity Costs

When any investment is made, the opportunity to earn a return from an alternative investment is lost. The lost return can be viewed as a cost that arises from a lost opportunity. For this reason, it is called an opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of capital is the return an investor gives up when his or her money is invested in one asset rather than the best alternative asset with the same risk. For example, suppose that a firm invests in a piece of equipment rather than returning money to stockholders. If stockholders could have earned an annual return of 12 percent on a stock with cash flows that are as risky as the cash flows the equipment will produce, this is the opportunity cost of capital associated with the investment in the piece of equipment.

Let’s consider the opportunity cost concept in the context of capital budgeting decisions. When investors buy shares of stock in a company or loan money to a company, they are giving management money to invest on their behalf. Thus, when a firm’s management makes capital investments in productive assets such as plant and equipment, they are investing stockholders’ and creditors’ money in real assets. Since stockholders and creditors could have invested their money in financial assets, the minimum rate of return they are willing to accept on an investment in a real asset is the rate they could have earned investing in financial assets that have similar risk. The rate of return that investors can earn on financial assets with similar risk is an opportunity cost because investors lose the opportunity to earn that rate if the money is invested in a real asset instead. It is therefore the rate of return that investors will require for an investment in a capital project. In other words, this rate is the cost of capital. It is also known as the opportunity cost of capital. Chapter 13 discusses how we estimate the opportunity cost of capital in practice.

opportunity cost of capital the return an investor gives up when his or her money is invested in one asset rather than the best alternative asset with the same risk

Capital Rationing

When a firm has all the money it needs to invest in all the capital projects that meet its capital selection criteria, the firm is said to be operating without a funding constraint, or resource constraint. Firms are rarely in this position, especially growth firms. Typically, a firm has a fixed number of dollars available for capital expenditures, and the number of qualified projects that need funding exceeds the funds that are available. This funding constraint on investments means that some projects will be mutually exclusive, since investing in one project exhausts resources that might otherwise be invested in another. When faced with a resource constraint, the firm must allocate its funds to the subset of projects that provides the largest increase in stockholder value. The process of limiting, or rationing, capital expenditures in this way is called capital rationing. Capital rationing and its implications for capital budgeting are discussed in Section 10.6.

capital rationing a situation where a firm does not have enough capital to invest in all attractive projects and must therefore ration capital

10.2 Net Present Value
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the benefits of using the net present value (NPV) method to analyze capital expenditure decisions and calculate the NPV for a capital project.
In this section we discuss a capital budgeting method that is consistent with this goal of financial management—to maximize the wealth of the firm’s owners. It is called the net present value (NPV) method, and it is one of the most basic analytical methods underlying corporate finance. The NPV method tells us the amount by which the benefits from a capital expenditure exceed its costs. It is the capital budgeting technique recommended in this book.

net present value (NPV) method a method of evaluating a capital investment project that measures the difference between its cost and the present value of its expected cash flows

Valuation of Real Assets
Throughout this book, we have emphasized that the value of any asset is the present value of its future cash flows. In Chapters 8 and 9, we developed valuation models for financial assets, such as bonds, preferred stock, and common stock. We now extend our discussion of valuation models from financial to real assets. The steps used in valuing an asset are the same whether the asset is real or financial:

Estimate the expected future cash flows.
Determine the required rate of return, or discount rate, which depends on the riskiness of the future cash flows.
Compute the present value of the future cash flows to determine what the asset is worth.
The valuation of real assets, however, is less straightforward than the valuation of financial assets, for two reasons.

First, in many cases, cash flows for financial assets are well documented in a legal contract. If they are not, we are at least able to make some reasonable assumptions about what they are. For real assets, much less information exists. Specialists within the firm, usually from the finance, marketing, and production groups, often prepare estimates of expected future cash flows for capital projects with only limited information.

Second, many financial securities are traded in public markets, and these markets are reasonably efficient. Thus, market data on rates of return are accessible. For real assets, no such markets exist. As a result, we must estimate required rates of return on real assets (opportunity costs) from market data on financial assets; this can be difficult to do.

NPV—The Basic Concept
The NPV of a project is the difference between the present value of the project’s expected future cash flows and the present value of its cost. The NPV can be expressed as follows:

If a capital project has a positive NPV, the value of the cash flows the project is expected to generate exceeds the project’s cost. Thus, a positive NPV project increases the value of the firm and, hence, stockholders’ wealth. If a capital project has a negative NPV, the value of the expected cash flows from the project is less than its cost. If accepted, a negative NPV project will decrease the value of the firm and stockholders’ wealth.

To illustrate these important points, consider an example. Suppose a firm is considering building a new marina for pleasure boats. The firm has an app that tells the future with perfect certainty. The finance staff estimates that the marina will cost $3.50 million. The app determines that the present value of the future cash flows from the marina is $4.25 million.

Assuming this information is correct, the NPV for the marina project is a positive $750,000 ($4.25 million − $3.50 million = $0.75 million). Management should accept the project because the excess of the value of the cash flows over cost increases the value of the firm by $750,000. Why is a positive NPV a direct measure of how much a capital project will increase the value of the firm? If management wanted to, the firm could sell the marina for $4.25 million, pay the $3.50 million in expenses, and deposit $750,000 in the bank. The value of the firm would increase by the $750,000 deposited in the bank. In sum, the NPV method tells us which capital projects to select and how much value they add to the firm.

NPV and Value Creation
We have just stated that any project with a positive NPV should be accepted because it will increase the value of the firm. Let’s take a moment to think about this proposition. What makes a capital asset worth more than it costs? In other words, how does management create value with capital investments?

How Value Is Created

Suppose that when you were in college, you worked part time at a successful pizza parlor near campus. During this time, you learned a lot about the pizza business. After graduation, for $100,000 you purchased a pizza parlor that was in a good location but had been forced to close because of a lack of business. The owners had let the restaurant and the quality of the pizzas deteriorate, and the wait staff had been rude to customers. Once you purchased the restaurant, you immediately invested $40,000 to fix it up: you painted the building, spruced up the interior, replaced some of the dining room furniture, and added an eye-catching, 1950s-style neon sign to attract attention. You also spent $15,000 for a one-time advertising blitz to quickly build a customer base. More important, you improved the quality of the pizzas you sold, and you built a profitable takeout business. Finally, you hired your wait staff carefully and trained them to be customer friendly.

Almost immediately the restaurant was earning a substantial profit and generating substantial cash flows. The really good news was that several owners of local pizzerias wanted to buy your restaurant. After intense negotiations with several of the potential buyers, you accepted a cash offer of $475,000 for the business shortly after you purchased it.

What is the NPV for the pizza parlor? For this investment, the NPV is easy to calculate. We do not need to estimate future cash flows and discount them because we already have an estimate of the present value of the cash flows the pizza parlor is expected to produce—$475,000. Someone is willing to pay you $475,000 because he or she believes the future cash flows are worth that amount. The cost of your investment includes the purchase price of the restaurant, the cost to fix it up, and the cost of the initial advertising campaign, which totals $155,000 ($100,000 + $40,000 + $15,000 = $155,000). Thus, the NPV for the pizza parlor is:

The $475,000 price paid for the pizza parlor exceeds the cost ($155,000) by $320,000. You have created $320,000 in value. How did you do this? You did it by improving the food, customer service, and dining ambiance while keeping prices competitive. Your management skills and knowledge of the pizza business resulted in significant growth in the current year’s cash flows and the prospect of even larger cash flows in the future.

Where did the $320,000 in value you created go? The NPV of your investment is the amount that your personal net worth increased because of the investment. For an ongoing business, the result would have been a $320,000 increase in the value of the firm.

How about the original owners? Why would they sell a business worth $475,000 to you for $100,000? The answer is simple; if they could have transformed the business as you did, they would have done so. Instead, when they ran the business, it lost money! They sold it to you because you offered them a price reflecting its value to them.

Market Data versus Discounted Cash Flows

Our pizza parlor example is greatly simplified by the fact that we can observe the price that someone is willing to pay for the asset. In most capital project analyses, we have to estimate the market value of the asset by forecasting its future cash flows and discounting them by the cost of capital. The discounted value of a project’s future cash flows is an estimate of its value, or the market price for which it can be sold.

Framework for Calculating NPV
We now describe a framework for analyzing capital budgeting decisions using the NPV method. As you will see, the NPV approach uses the discounted cash flow technique developed in Chapters 5 and 6 and applied in Chapters 8 and 9. The good news, then, is that the NPV method requires only the application of what you already know.

The five-step framework discussed in this section and a cash flow worksheet like the one illustrated in Exhibit 10.2 can help you systematically organize a project’s cash flow data and compute its NPV. Most mistakes people make when working capital budgeting problems result from problems with cash flows: not identifying a cash flow, getting a cash flow in the wrong time period, or assigning the wrong sign to a cash flow. What can make cash flow analysis difficult in capital budgeting is that there are often multiple cash flows in a single time period, and some are cash inflows and others are cash outflows.

As always, we recommend that you prepare a time line when doing capital budgeting problems. Exhibit 10.2 shows a sample time line along with an identification of the cash flows for each period. Our goal is to compute the net cash flow (NCF) for each time period t, where NCFt = Total cash inflows − Total cash outflows for the period t. For a capital project, the time periods (t) are usually in years, and t varies from the current period (t = 0) to some finite time period that is the estimated life of the project (t = n). Recall that getting the correct sign on each cash flow is critical to getting the correct answer to a problem. As you have seen in earlier chapters, the convention in finance problem solving is that cash inflows carry a positive sign and cash outflows carry a negative sign. Finally, note that all cash flows in this chapter are on an after-tax basis. We will make adjustments for tax consequences on specific transactions such as the calculation of a project’s salvage value.

Our five-step framework for analysis is as follows:

Determine the initial cost of starting the project. We first need to identify and add up all the cash flows related to the initial cost of starting the project. In most cases, the initial cost of a project is incurred at the start; hence the cash flows are already in current dollars. These cash flows typically include any property, plant, and equipment outlays for production as well as employee hiring and training costs. In some cases, like those involving the construction of a manufacturing facility, these initial outlays can be made over several years before the project is up and running. Of course, any future cash flows must be discounted to obtain their present value. Turning to Exhibit 10.2, we have incurred a single negative cash flow (−CF0) as our initial cost of starting the project; thus NCF0 has a negative value.
Estimate the project’s future cash flows over its expected life. Once they are up and running, capital projects typically generate some cash inflows from revenues (CIFt) for each period, along with some cash outflows (COFt) associated with costs incurred to generate the revenues. In most cases revenues exceed costs, and thus, NCFt is positive. However, this may not always be the case. For example, if the project is the purchase of a piece of equipment, it is possible for NCF3 to have a negative value (CIF3 < COF3) if the equipment is projected to need a major overhaul or must be replaced during the third year. Finally, you also need to pay attention to a project’s final cash flow, which is t = 5 in Exhibit 10.2. Final project cash flows can be positive or negative. For example, the company might have to pay the costs of environmental cleanup for a production site. There may also be a salvage value (SV) for machinery and equipment at the end of the project, which is a cash inflow. In that case NCF5 = CIF5 − COF5 + SV. The important point is that for each time period, we must identify all the cash flows that take place, assign each cash flow its proper sign, and add up all the cash flows.
Determine the riskiness of the project and the appropriate cost of capital. The third step is to identify for each project its risk-adjusted cost of capital, which takes into account the riskiness of the project’s cash flows. The riskier the project, the higher its cost of capital. The cost of capital is the discount rate used in determining the present value of the future expected cash flows. In this chapter, the cost of capital and any risk adjustments will be supplied, and no calculations will be required for this step.
Compute the project’s NPV. The NPV, as you know, is the present value of the net cash flows the project is expected to generate minus the cost of the project.
Make a decision. If the NPV is positive, the project should be accepted because all projects with a positive NPV will increase the value of the firm. If the NPV is negative, the project should be rejected; projects with negative NPVs will decrease the value of the firm.
Exhibit 10.2 shows a sample worksheet for conducting an NPV analysis.

EXHIBIT 10.2 Sample Worksheet for Net Present Value Analysis In addition to following the five-step framework for solving NPV analysis problems, we recommend that you use a worksheet with a time line like the one shown here to help you determine the proper cash flows for each period.


You might be wondering about how to handle a capital project with an NPV of 0. Technically, management should be indifferent to accepting or rejecting projects such as this because they neither increase nor decrease the value of the firm. When the NPV = 0, the project is generating returns that are just equal to the opportunity cost of capital. At a practical level, projects rarely have an NPV equal to 0, and most firms have more good capital projects (with NPV > 0) than they can fund. Thus, this is not an issue that generates much interest among practitioners.

Net Present Value Techniques
The NPV of a capital project can be stated in equation form as the present value of all net cash flows (total cash inflows − total cash outflows) connected with the project, whether in the current period or in the future. The NPV equation can be written as follows:

(10.1)
where:

NCFt	=	net cash flow (total cash inflows − total cash outflows) in period t, where t = 0, 1, 2, 3, …, n
k	=	the cost of capital
n	=	the project’s estimated life
Next, we will work an example to see how the NPV is calculated for a capital project. Suppose you are the president of a small regional firm located in Chicago that manufactures frozen pizzas which are sold to grocery stores and to firms in the hospitality and food service industry. Your market research group has developed an idea for a “pocket” pizza that can be used as an entrée with a meal or as an “on the go” snack. The sales manager believes that, with an aggressive advertising campaign, sales of the product will be about $300,000 per year. The cost to modify the existing production line will also be $300,000, according to the plant manager. The marketing and plant managers estimate that the cost to produce the pocket pizzas, to market and advertise them, and to deliver them to customers will be about $220,000 per year. The product’s life is estimated to be five years, and the specialized equipment necessary for the project has an estimated salvage value of $30,000. The appropriate cost of capital is 15 percent.

When analyzing capital budgeting problems, we typically have a lot of data to sort through. The worksheet introduced in Exhibit 10.2 is helpful in keeping track of the data in an organized format.The steps in analyzing the project’s cash flows and determining its NPV are as follows:

Determine the initial cost of starting the project. The cost of the project is the one-time cost to modify the existing production line, which is $300,000. This is a cash outflow (negative sign).
Estimate the project’s future cash flows over its expected life. The project’s future cash inflows come from sales of the new product. Sales are estimated at $300,000 per year (positive sign). The cash outflows are the costs to manufacture and distribute the new product, which are $220,000 per year (negative sign). The life of the project is five years. The project has a salvage value of $30,000, which is a cash inflow (positive sign). The net cash flow (NCF) in a particular time period is just the sum of the cash inflows and cash outflows for that period, including the cost of starting the project and any salvage value. For example, the NCF for period t = 0 is −$300,000, the NCF for period t = 1 is $80,000, and so on, as you can see in Exhibit 10.3.
Determine the riskiness of the project and the appropriate cost of capital. The discount rate is the cost of capital, which is 15 percent.
Compute the project’s NPV. To compute the project’s NPV, we apply Equation 10.1 by plugging in the NCF values for each time period and using the cost of capital, 15 percent, as the discount rate. The equation looks like this (the figures are in thousands of dollars):
The NPV for the pocket pizza project is therefore −$16,910.

Make a decision. The pocket pizza project has a negative NPV, which indicates that the project is not a good investment and should be rejected. If management undertook this project, the value of the firm would decrease by $16,910; and, if the firm had 100,000 shares of stock outstanding, we can estimate that the project would decrease the value of each share by about 17 cents ($16,910/100,000 shares = $0.1691 per share).
Exhibit 10.3 shows the time line and relevant cash flows for the pocket pizza project.

EXHIBIT 10.3 Pocket Pizza Project Time Line and Cash Flows ($ thousands) The worksheet introduced in Exhibit 10.2 is helpful in organizing the data given for the pocket pizza project.


Calculating NPV with a Financial Calculator

Using a financial calculator is an easier way to calculate the present value of the future cash flows. In this example you should recognize that the cash flow pattern is a five-year ordinary annuity with an additional cash inflow in the fifth year. This is exactly the cash pattern for a bond with annual coupon payments and payment of principal at maturity that we saw in Chapter 8. We can find the present value using a financial calculator, with $80 being the annuity stream for five years and $30 the salvage value at Year 5:


The PV of the future cash flows is −$283.09. With that information, we can compute the NPV using Equation 10.1 as follows:

Learning by Doing Application 10.1 and the following Using Excel Example illustrate another NPV calculation.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 10.1
The Dough’s Up: The Self-Rising Pizza Project

Problem

Let’s continue our frozen pizza example. Suppose the head of the research and development (R&D) group announces that R&D engineers have developed a breakthrough technology—self-rising frozen pizza dough that, when baked, rises and tastes exactly like fresh-baked dough.

The cost is $300,000 to modify the production line, and the modifications will have a five-year life. Sales of the new product are estimated at $200,000 for the first year, $300,000 for the next two years, and $500,000 for the final two years. It is estimated that production, sales, and advertising costs will be $250,000 for the first year and will then decline to a constant $200,000 per year. There is no salvage value at the end of the product’s life, and the appropriate cost of capital is 15 percent. Is the project, as proposed, economically viable?





Using Excel
Net Present Value

Net present value problems are most commonly solved using a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet’s design is good for keeping track of all the cash flows and the periods in which they occur. The spreadsheet setup for Learning by Doing Application 10.1, presented on the right, shows how to calculate the NPV for the self-rising pizza dough machine.

Notice that the Excel NPV formula does not take into account the cash flow in year zero. Therefore, you only enter into the NPV formula the cash flows in Years 1 through 5, along with the discount rate. You then add the cash flow in Year zero to the total from the NPV formula calculation to get the NPV for the investment.


Mutually Exclusive Projects and NPV

Recall that investments are mutually exclusive if, by making one, another will not be undertaken. Projects may be mutually exclusive because they are substitutes for one another or because the firm has a funding constraint. A project’s NPV provides an objective measure of its incremental value to the firm’s investors, and thus makes it simple to choose between two or more mutually exclusive projects. When faced with such a choice, managers should allocate capital to the project that has the most positive dollar impact on the value of the firm—in other words, the project with the highest NPV.

Decision Making Example 10.1 illustrates how NPVs are used in project selection.

DECISION MAKING Example 10.1
The IS Department’s Capital Projects

Situation

Suppose you are the manager of the information systems (IS) department of the frozen pizza manufacturer we have been discussing. Your department has identified four possible capital projects with the following NPVs: (1) $4,500, (2) $3,000, (3) $0.0, and (4) −$1,000. What should you decide about each project if the projects are independent? What should you decide if the projects are mutually exclusive?



Concluding Comments on NPV
Some concluding comments about the NPV method are in order. First, as you may have noticed, the NPV computations are rather mechanical once we have estimated the cash flows and the cost of capital. The real difficulty is estimating or forecasting the future cash flows. Although this may seem to be a daunting task, managers with experience in producing and selling a particular type of product can usually generate fairly accurate estimates of sales volumes, prices, and production costs. Most business managers are routinely required to make decisions that involve expectations about future events. In fact, that is what business is really all about—dealing with uncertainty and making decisions that involve risk.

Second, estimating project cash flows over a long forecast period requires skill and judgment. There is nothing wrong with using estimates to make business decisions as long as they are based on informed judgments and not guesses. Problems can arise with the cash flow estimates when a project team becomes overly enamored with a project. In wanting a particular project to succeed, a project team can be too optimistic about the cash flow projections. It is therefore very important that capital budgeting decisions be subject to ongoing and postaudit review.

In conclusion, the NPV approach is the method we recommend for making capital investment decisions. It provides a direct (dollar) measure of how much a project will increase the value of the firm. NPV also makes it possible to correctly choose between mutually exclusive projects. The accompanying table summarizes NPV decision rules and the method’s key advantages and disadvantages.

10.3 The Payback Period
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the strengths and weaknesses of the payback period as a capital expenditure decision-making tool and compute the payback period for a capital project.
The payback period is one of the most widely used tools for evaluating capital projects. The payback period is defined as the number of years it takes for the cash flows from a project to recover the project’s initial investment. With the payback method for evaluating projects, a project is accepted if its payback period is below some specified threshold. Although it has serious weaknesses, this method does provide some insight into how quickly a firm will recover the cash that has been invested in a project.

payback period the length of time required to recover a project’s initial cost

Computing the Payback Period
To compute the payback period, we need to know the project’s cost and estimate its future net cash flows. The net cash flows and the project cost are the same values that we use to compute the NPV. The payback (PB) equation can be expressed as follows:

(10.2)
Exhibit 10.5 shows the net cash flows (row 1) and cumulative net cash flows (row 2) for a proposed capital project with an initial cost of $70,000. The payback period calculation for our example is:

Let’s look at this calculation in more detail. Note in Exhibit 10.5 that the firm recovers cash flows of $30,000 in the first year and $30,000 in the second year, for a total of $60,000 over the two years. During the third year, the firm needs to recover only $10,000 ($70,000 − $60,000 = $10,000) to pay back the full cost of the project. The third-year cash flow is $20,000. Assuming that the cash flows arrive evenly throughout the year, we will have to wait 0.5 year ($10,000/$20,000 = 0.5) to recover the final amount. Thus, the payback period for this project is 2.5 years (2 years + 0.5 year = 2.5 years). Exhibit 10.5 shows the payback period cash flows and calculations.

EXHIBIT 10.5 Payback Period Cash Flows and Calculations The exhibit shows the net and cumulative net cash flows for a proposed capital project with an initial cost of $70,000. The cash flow data are used to compute the payback period, which is 2.5 years.


The idea behind the payback period method is simple: the shorter the payback period, the faster the firm gets its money back and the more desirable the project. However, there is no economic rationale that links the payback method to stockholder value maximization. Firms that use the payback method accept all projects having a payback period under some threshold and reject those with a payback period over this threshold. If a firm has a number of projects that are mutually exclusive, the projects are selected in order of their payback rank: projects with the shortest payback period are selected first.

Learning by Doing Application 10.2 illustrates additional payback calculations.

How the Payback Period Performs
We have worked through some simple examples of how the payback period is computed. Now we will consider several more complex situations to see how well the payback period performs as a capital budgeting rule. Exhibit 10.6 illustrates five different capital budgeting projects. The projects all have an initial investment of $500, but each one has a different cash flow pattern. The bottom part of the exhibit shows each project’s payback period, along with its net present value for comparison. We will assume that management has set a payback period of two years as the cutoff point for an acceptable project.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 10.2
A Payback Calculation

Problem

A firm has two capital projects, A and B, which are under review for funding. Both projects cost $500, and the projects have the following cash flows:

Year	Project A	Project B
0	−$500	−$500
1	     100	     400
2	     200	     300
3	     200	     200
4	     400	     100
What is the payback period for each project? If the projects are independent, which project should management select? If the projects are mutually exclusive, which project should management accept? The firm’s payback cutoff point is two years.





EXHIBIT 10.6 Payback Period with Various Cash Flow Patterns

Each of the five capital budgeting projects shown in the exhibit calls for an initial investment of $500, but all have different cash flow patterns. The bottom part of the exhibit shows each project’s payback period, along with its net present value for comparison.

Year	A	B	C	D	E
0	−$500	−$500	 −$500	 −$500	−$500
1	     200	     300	      250	      500	     200

NPV	  $450	−$131	  −$115	−$2,924	$2,815
Cost of capital = 15%						
Project A: The cash flows for Project A are $200 in the first year and $300 in the second, for a total of $500; thus, the project’s payback period is two years. Under our acceptance criterion, management should accept this project. Project A also has a positive NPV of $450, so the two capital budgeting decision rules agree.

Project B: Project B never generates enough cash flows to pay off the original investment of $500: $300 + $100 + $50 = $450. Thus, the project payback period is infinite. With an infinite payback period, the project should be rejected. Also, as you would expect, Project B’s NPV is negative. So far, the payback period and NPV methods have agreed on which projects to accept.

Project C: Project C has a payback period of two years: $250 + $250 = $500. Thus, according to the payback criteria, it should be accepted. However, the project’s NPV is a negative $115, which indicates that the project should be rejected. Why the conflict? Look at the cash flows after the payback period of two years. In Year 3 the project requires an additional investment of $250 (a cash outflow) and now is in a deficit position; that is, the cumulative net cash balance is now only $250 ($250 + $250 − $250 = $250). Then, in the final year, the project earns an additional $250, recovering the cost of the total investment. The payback period analysis can lead to erroneous decisions because the rule does not consider cash flows after the payback period.

Projects D and E: Projects D and E dramatically illustrate the problem when a capital budgeting evaluation tool fails to consider cash flows after the payback period. Project D has a payback period of one year, suggesting that it should be accepted, and Project E has a payback period of 2.5 years, suggesting that it should be rejected. However, looking at the future cash flows suggests otherwise. It is clear that Project D, with a negative $5,000 cash flow in Year 4, is a disaster and should be rejected, while Project E, with a positive $5,000 cash flow in Year 4, should be accepted. Indeed, the NPV analysis confirms these conclusions: Project D has a negative NPV of $2,924, and Project E has a positive NPV of $2,815. In both instances, the payback rule led to the wrong economic decision. These examples illustrate that a rapid payback does not necessarily mean a good investment.

Discounted Payback Period
Another weakness of the ordinary payback period criteria is that it does not take into account the time value of money. All dollars received before the cutoff period are given equal weight. To address this problem, some financial managers use a variant of the payback period called the discounted payback period. The discounted payback calculation is similar to the ordinary payback calculation except that the future cash flows are discounted by the cost of capital. Exhibit 10.7 shows the discounted payback period cash flows and calculations.

discounted payback period the length of time required to recover a project’s initial cost, accounting for the time value of money

EXHIBIT 10.7 Discounted Payback Period Cash Flows and Calculations The exhibit shows the net and cumulative net cash flows for a proposed capital project with an initial cost of $40,000. The cash flow data are used to compute the discounted payback period for a 10 percent cost of capital, which is 2.35 years.


The major advantage of the discounted payback approach is that it tells management how long it takes a project to reach an NPV of zero. This is an improvement over the standard payback calculation, which can lead to accepting projects with negative NPVs. Despite this improvement, the discounted payback method is not widely used by businesses, and it also ignores all cash flows after the arbitrary cutoff period, which is a major flaw.

To see how the discounted payback period is calculated, let’s take a look at Exhibit 10.7. The exhibit shows the net cash flows for a proposed capital project along with both the cumulative and discounted cumulative cash flows; thus, we can compute both the ordinary and the discounted payback periods for the project and then compare them. The cost of capital is 10 percent.

The first two rows show the nondiscounted cash flows, and we can see by inspection that the ordinary payback period is two years. We do not need to make any additional calculations because the cumulative cash flows equal zero at precisely two years. Now let’s turn our attention to the lower two rows, which show the project’s discounted and cumulative discounted cash flows. Note that the first year’s cash flow is $20,000 and its discounted value is $18,182 ($20,000 × (1/1.1) = $18,182). The second year’s cash flow is also $20,000, and its discounted value is $16,529 ($20,000 × (1/(1.1)2) = $16,529). Now, looking at the cumulative discounted NCF row, notice that it turns positive between two and three years. This means that the discounted payback period is two years plus some fraction of the third year’s discounted cash flow. The exact discounted payback period computed value is 2 years + $5,289/$15,026 year = 2 years + 0.35 year = 2.35 years.

As expected, the discounted payback period is longer than the ordinary payback period (2 years < 2.35 years), and in 2.35 years the project will reach a NPV of $0. The project NPV is positive (NPV = $9,737); therefore, we should accept the project. But notice that the payback decision criteria are ambiguous. If we use 2.0 years as the payback criterion, we reject the project, and if we use 2.5 or 3.0 years as the criterion, the project is accepted. The lack of a definitive decision rule remains a major problem with the payback period as a capital budgeting tool.

Evaluating the Payback Rule
The standard payback period is often calculated for projects because it provides an intuitive and simple measure of a project’s liquidity risk. This makes sense because there is a strong feeling in business that “getting your money back quickly” is an important standard when making capital investments. This intuition can be economically justified if the firm faces payments to creditors before the payback date, or if estimates of project cash flows beyond the payback date are very uncertain. Probably the greatest advantage of the payback period is its simplicity; it is easy to calculate and easy to understand.

When compared with the NPV method, however, the payback methods have some serious shortcomings. First, the standard payback calculation does not adjust or account for the time value of money or risk associated with future cash flows. Second, there is little economic justification for the choice of the payback cutoff criteria other than a liquidity motive. Who is to say that a particular cutoff, such as two years, is optimal with regard to maximizing stockholder value? Finally, perhaps the greatest shortcoming of the payback method is its failure to consider cash flows after the payback period. As a result, the payback method is biased toward shorter-term projects and may cause managers to reject important positive NPV projects where cash inflows tend to occur farther in the future, such as research and development investments, new product launches, and entry into new lines of business.

While the payback period is relatively simple to calculate, it is important to note that payback requires forecasts of future project cash flows up to the established cutoff period. Furthermore, discounted payback requires that managers identify a project’s discount rate. Thus the inputs into the payback and NPV methods are virtually identical. Consequently, using a payback method may not even save much time and effort in evaluating a project. The table below summarizes key advantages and disadvantages of the payback method.

10.4 The Accounting Rate of Return
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain why the accounting rate of return (ARR) is not recommended for use as a capital expenditure decision-making tool.
We turn next to a capital budgeting technique based on the accounting rate of return (ARR), sometimes called the book value rate of return. This method computes the return on a capital project using accounting numbers—the project’s net income (NI) and book value (BV)—rather than cash flow data. The ARR can be calculated in a number of ways, but the most common definition is:

accounting rate of return (ARR) a rate of return on a capital project based on average net income divided by average book value over the project’s life; also called the book value rate of return

(10.3)
where:

Average net income	=	(NI1 + NI2 + ⋯ + NIn)/n
Average book value	=	(BV0 + BV1 + BV2 + ⋯ + BVn)/(n + 1)
n	=	the project’s estimated life
BV0	=	the original cost of the asset
Although ARR is fairly easy to understand and calculate, as you probably guessed, it has major flaws as a tool for evaluating capital expenditure decisions. Instead of discounting a project’s cash flows over time, it simply gives us a number based on average figures from the income statement and balance sheet. Thus, the ARR is based on accounting numbers and ignores the time value of money. Also, as with the payback method, there is no economic rationale that links a particular acceptance criterion to the goal of maximizing stockholder value.

Because of these major shortcomings, the ARR technique should not be used to evaluate the viability of capital projects under any circumstances. You may wonder why we even included the ARR technique in this book if it is a poor criterion for evaluating projects. The reason is simply that we want to be sure that if you run across the ARR method at work, you will recognize it and be aware of its shortcomings.

10.5 Internal Rate of Return
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Compute the internal rate of return (IRR) for a capital project and discuss the conditions under which the IRR technique and the NPV technique produce different results.
The internal rate of return, known in practice as the IRR, is an important alternative to the NPV method. The NPV and IRR techniques are closely related in that both involve discounting the cash flows from a project; thus, both account for the time value of money. When we use the NPV method to evaluate a capital project, the discount rate is the rate of return required by investors for investments with similar risk, which is the project’s opportunity cost of capital. When we use the IRR, we are looking for the rate of return associated with a project so that we can determine whether this rate is higher or lower than the project’s discount rate.

internal rate of return (IRR) the discount rate at which the present value of a project’s expected cash inflows equals the present value of the project’s outflows; it is the discount rate at which the project’s NPV equals zero

We can define the IRR as the discount rate that equates the present value of a project’s cost to the present value of its expected cash inflows:

This means that we can also describe the IRR as the discount rate that causes the NPV to equal zero. This relation can be written in a general form as follows:

(10.4)
Because of their close relation, it may seem that the IRR and the NPV are interchangeable—that is, either should tell you to accept or reject the same capital projects. After all, both methods are based on whether the project’s return exceeds the cost of capital and, hence, whether the project will add value to the firm. In many circumstances, the IRR and NPV methods do give us the same answer. As you will see later, however, some of the properties of the IRR equation can lead to incorrect decisions concerning whether to accept or reject a particular capital project.

Calculating the IRR
The IRR is an expected rate of return much like the yield to maturity we calculated for bonds in Chapter 8. Thus, in calculating the IRR, we need to apply the same trial-and-error method we used in Chapter 8. We will begin by doing some IRR calculations by trial and error so that you understand the process, and then we will switch to the financial calculator and computer spreadsheets, which provide an answer more quickly.

Trial-and-Error Method

Suppose that Ford Motor Company has an investment opportunity with cash flows (in thousands of dollars) as shown in Exhibit 10.8 and that the cost of capital is 12 percent. We want to find the IRR for this project. Using Equation 10.4, we will substitute various values for IRR into the equation to compute the project’s IRR by trial and error. We continue this process until we find the IRR value that makes Equation 10.4 equal zero.

A good starting point is to use the cost of capital as the discount rate. Note that when we discount the NCFs by the cost of capital, we are calculating the project’s NPV:

Recall that the result we are looking for is zero. Because our result is greater than zero ($16.44), the discount rate of 12 percent is too low, and we must try a higher rate. Let’s try 13 percent:

We are very close; let’s try 14 percent:

Because our result is now a negative number, we know the correct rate is between 13 percent and 14 percent, and looking at the magnitude of the numbers, we know that the answer is closer to 14 percent. Let’s try 13.7 percent.

Good guess! This means that the NPV of Ford’s capital project is zero at a discount rate of 13.7 percent. The required rate of return is the cost of capital, which is 12.0 percent. Since the project’s IRR of 13.7 percent exceeds the cost of capital, the IRR criterion indicates that the project should be accepted. Exhibit 10.8 shows the time line and expected net cash flows for the Ford Motor Company project.

EXHIBIT 10.8 Time Line and Expected Net Cash Flows for the Ford Motor Company Project ($ thousands) The cash flow data in the exhibit are used to compute the project’s IRR. The project’s NPV is a positive $16,440, which indicates that the IRR is greater than the cost of capital of 12 percent.


The project’s NPV is a positive $16,440, which also indicates that Ford should go ahead with the project. Thus, both the IRR and the NPV suggest the same conclusion.

Learning by Doing Application 10.3 and the following Using Excel Example illustrate additional IRR calculations.

When the IRR and NPV Methods Agree
In the Ford example, the IRR and NPV methods agree. The two methods will always agree when you are evaluating independent projects and the projects’ cash flows are conventional. As discussed earlier, an independent project is one that can be selected with no effect on the viability of any other project. A project with conventional cash flows is one with an initial cash outflow followed by one or more cash inflows. Put another way, after the initial investment is made (cash outflow), the net cash flow in each future year is positive (inflows). For example, the purchase of a bond involves conventional cash flows. You purchase the bond for a price (cash outflow), and in the future you receive coupon payments and a principal payment at maturity (cash inflows).

conventional cash flow a cash flow pattern consisting of an initial cash outflow that is followed by one or more cash inflows

Calculating the IRR at Larry’s Homemade Ice Cream Shop

Problem

Larry’s Homemade Ice Cream Shop in the DuPont Circle area of Washington, D.C., is famous for its gourmet ice cream. However, some customers have asked for a healthy, low-cal, soft yogurt. The machine that makes this yogurt is manufactured in Italy and costs $5,000 plus $1,750 for installation. Larry estimates that the machine will generate a net cash flow of $2,000 a year. Larry also estimates that the machine’s life will be 10 years and that it will have a $400 salvage value. His cost of capital is 15 percent. Larry thinks the machine is overpriced. Is he right?





Using Excel
Internal Rate of Return

You know that calculating IRR by hand can be tedious. The trial-and-error method can take a long time. Knowing all the cash flows and an approximate rate will allow you to use a spreadsheet to get an answer quickly.

The accompanying spreadsheet shows the setup for calculating the IRR for the low-cal yogurt machine at Larry’s Homemade Ice Cream Shop that is described in Learning by Doing Application 10.3.

Here are a couple of important points to note about IRR calculations using spreadsheets:

Unlike the NPV formula, the Excel IRR formula accounts for all cash flows, including the initial investment in Year 0, so there is no need to add this cash flow later.
The syntax of the IRR function requires that you first provide the project’s cash flows in order beginning at time zero. To calculate the IRR, you can provide a “guess” value, or a number you estimate is close to the IRR. A good value to start with is the cost of capital.

Let’s look more closely at the kinds of situations in which the NPV and the IRR methods agree. A good way to visualize the relation between the IRR and NPV methods is to graph NPV as a function of the discount rate. The graph, called an NPV profile, shows the NPV of the project at various costs of capital.

NPV profile a graph showing NPV as a function of the discount rate

Exhibit 10.9 shows the NPV profile for the Ford Motor Company project. We have placed the NPVs on the vertical axis, or y-axis, and the discount rates on the horizontal axis, or x-axis. We used the calculations from our earlier example and made some additional NPV calculations at various discount rates as follows:

Discount Rate	NPV ($ thousands)
     0%	$160
  5	    94
10	    37
15	  −12
20	  −54
25	  −92
30	 −124
As you can see, a discount rate of 0 percent corresponds with an NPV of $160,000, a discount rate of 5 percent with an NPV of $94,000, and so forth. As the discount rate increases, the NPV curve declines smoothly. Not surprisingly, the curve intersects the x-axis at precisely the point where the NPV is 0 and the IRR is 13.7 percent.

The NPV profile in Exhibit 10.9 illustrates why the NPV and IRR methods lead to identical accept-reject decisions for the Ford Motor Company project. The IRR of 13.7 percent precisely marks the point at which the NPV changes from a positive to a negative value. Whenever a project is independent and has conventional cash flows, the result will be as shown in the exhibit. The NPV will decline as the discount rate increases, and the IRR and the NPV methods will result in the same capital expenditure decision.

EXHIBIT 10.9 NPV Profile for the Ford Motor Company Project In the NPV profile for the Ford Motor Company project, the NPV value is on the vertical (y) axis and the discount rate is on the horizontal (x) axis. You can see that as the discount rate increases, the NPV profile curve declines smoothly and intersects the x-axis at the point where the NPV is 0. The IRR of 13.7 percent is the point at which the NPV changes from a positive to a negative value. The NPV and IRR methods lead to identical accept-or-reject decisions for the Ford Motor Company project.


When the NPV and IRR Methods Disagree
We have seen that the IRR and NPV methods lead to identical investment decisions for capital projects that are independent and that have conventional cash flows. However, if either of these conditions is not met, the IRR and NPV methods can produce different accept-reject decisions.

Unconventional Cash Flows

Unconventional cash flows can cause a conflict between the NPV and IRR decision rules. In some instances the cash flows for an unconventional project are just the reverse of those of a conventional project: the initial cash flow is positive, and all subsequent cash flows are negative. In this case, we need only reverse the IRR decision rule and accept the project if the IRR is less than the cost of capital to make the IRR and NPV methods agree.

When a project’s future cash flows include both positive and negative cash flows, the situation is more complicated. An example of such a project is an assembly line that will require one or more major renovations over its lifetime. Another common business situation is a project that has conventional cash flows except for the final cash flow, which is negative. The final cash flow might be negative because extensive environmental cleanup is required at the end of the project, such as the cost for decommissioning a nuclear power plant, or because the equipment originally purchased has little or no salvage value and is expensive to remove.

Consider an example. Suppose a firm invests in a gold-mining operation that costs $55 million and has an expected life of two years. In the first year, the project generates a cash inflow of $150 million. In the second year, extensive environmental and site restoration is required, so the expected cash flow is a negative $100 million. The time line for these cash flows follows.


Once again, the best way to understand the effect of these cash flows is to look at an NPV profile. Shown here are NPV calculations we made at various discount rates to generate the data necessary to plot the NPV profile shown in Exhibit 10.10:

Discount Rate	NPV ($ millions)
      0%	−$5.00
10	  −1.28
20	    0.56
30	    1.21
40	    1.12
50	    0.56
60	  −0.31
70	  −1.37
Looking at the data in the table, you can probably spot a problem. The NPV is initially negative (−$5.00); then, at a discount rate of 20 percent, switches to positive ($0.56); and then, at a discount rate of 60 percent, switches back to negative (−$0.31).

The NPV profile in Exhibit 10.10 shows the results of this pattern: we have two IRRs, one at 16.05 percent and the other at 55.65 percent. Which is the correct IRR, or are both correct? Actually, there is no correct answer; the results are meaningless, and you should not try to interpret them. Thus, in this situation, the IRR technique provides information that should not be used for decision making.

How many IRR solutions can there be for a given cash flow? The maximum number of IRR solutions is equal to the number of sign reversals in the cash flow stream. For a project with a conventional cash flow, there is only one cash flow sign reversal; thus, there is only one IRR solution. In our mining example, there are two cash flow sign reversals; thus, there are two IRR solutions.

Finally, for some cash flow patterns, it is impossible to compute an IRR. These situations can occur when the initial cash flow (t = 0) is either a cash inflow or outflow and is followed by cash flows with two or more sign reversals. An example of such a cash flow pattern is NCF0 = $15, NCF1 = −$25, and NCF2 = $20. This type of cash flow pattern might occur on a building project where the contractor is given a prepayment, usually the cost of materials and supplies ($15); then does the construction and pays the labor cost ($25); and finally, upon completion of the work, receives the final payment ($20). Note that when it is not possible to compute an IRR, the project either has a positive NPV or a negative NPV for all possible discount rates. In this example, the NPV is always positive.

EXHIBIT 10.10 NPV Profile for Gold-Mining Operation with Multiple IRR Solutions The gold-mining operation has unconventional cash flows. Because there are two cash flow sign reversals, we end up with two IRRs—16.05 percent and 55.65 percent—neither of them useful. In situations like this, the IRR provides a solution that is meaningless and, therefore, the results should not be used for capital budgeting decisions.


Mutually Exclusive Projects

The other situation in which the IRR can lead to incorrect capital budgeting decisions is when projects are mutually exclusive—that is, when accepting one project means rejecting the other. For example, suppose you own a small store in the business district of Seattle that is currently vacant. You are looking at two business opportunities: opening an upscale coffee house or opening a copy center. Since you cannot pursue both projects at the same location, they are mutually exclusive.

When you have mutually exclusive projects, how do you select the best alternative? If you are using the NPV method, the answer is easy. You select the project that has the highest NPV because it will increase the value of the firm by the largest amount. If you are using the IRR method, it would seem logical to select the project with the highest IRR. In this case, though, the logic is wrong! You cannot tell which mutually exclusive project to select just by looking at the projects’ IRRs.

Let’s consider another example to illustrate the problem. The cash flows for two projects, A and B, are as follows:

Year	Project A	Project B
0	−$100	−$100
1	       50	       20
2	       40	       30
3	       30	       50
4	       30	       65
The IRR is 20.7 percent for Project A and 19.0 percent for Project B. Because the two projects are mutually exclusive, only one project can be accepted. If you were following the IRR decision rule, you would accept Project A. However, as you will see, it turns out that Project B might be the better choice.

The following table shows the NPVs for the two projects at several discount rates:

Discount Rate	NPV of Project A	NPV of Project B
      0%	$50.0	$65.0
  5	  34.5	  42.9
10	  21.5	  24.9
13	  14.8	  15.7
15	  10.6	  10.1
20	    1.3	  −2.2
25	 −6.8	−12.6
30	−13.7 	−21.3
IRR	        20.7%	        19.0%
Notice that the NPV of each project depends on the rate of return used to discount the cash flows. Our example shows a conflict in the ranking order between the IRR and NPV methods at discount rates between 0 percent and 13 percent. In this range, Project B has the lower IRR, but it has the higher NPV and should be the project selected. If the discount rate is 15 percent or above, however, Project A has the higher NPV as well as the higher IRR. In this range, there is no conflict between the two evaluation methods.

The relative IRR and NPV rankings change in this way because the larger cash inflows of Project B arrive later than the larger cash flows of Project A. Thus, higher discount rates have more of an impact on the value of Project B. In other words, changes in relative IRR and NPV rankings result from differences in the timing of project cash flows.

Now take a look at Exhibit 10.11, which shows the NPV profiles for Projects A and B. As you can see, there is a point, called the crossover point, at which the NPV profiles for Projects A and B intersect. The crossover point here is at a discount rate of 14.3 percent. For any cost of capital above 14.3 percent, the NPV for Project A is higher than that for Project B; thus, Project A should be selected if its NPV is positive. For any cost of capital below the crossover point, Project B should be selected.

crossover point the discount rate at which the NPV profiles of two projects cross and, thus, at which the NPVs of the projects are equal

EXHIBIT 10.11 NPV Profiles for Two Mutually Exclusive Projects The NPV profiles for two projects often cross over each other. When evaluating mutually exclusive projects, it is helpful to know where this crossover point is. For Projects A and B in the exhibit, the crossover point is at 14.3 percent. For any cost of capital above 14.3 percent but below 20.7 percent, the NPV for Project A is higher than that for Project B and is positive; thus, Project A should be selected. For any cost of capital below the crossover point, the NPV of Project B is higher, and Project B should be selected.


Another conflict involving mutually exclusive projects concerns comparisons of projects that have significantly different costs. The IRR does not adjust for these differences in the scale of projects. What the IRR gives us is a rate of return on each dollar invested. In contrast, the NPV method computes the total dollar value created by the project.

Decision Making Example 10.2 illustrates how this conflict can distort investment decisions when using the IRR criteria to evaluate mutually exclusive projects.

Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)
A major weakness of the IRR method compared with the NPV method concerns the rate at which the cash flows generated by a capital project are reinvested. The NPV method assumes that cash flows from a project are reinvested at the cost of capital, whereas the IRR technique assumes they are reinvested at the IRR. Determining which is the better assumption depends on which rate better represents the rate that firms can actually earn when they reinvest a project’s cash flows over time. It is generally believed that the cost of capital, which is often lower than the IRR, better reflects the rate that firms are likely to earn. Using the IRR may thus involve overly optimistic assumptions regarding reinvestment rates.

To eliminate the reinvestment rate assumption of the IRR, some practitioners prefer to calculate the modified internal rate of return (MIRR). In this approach, each operating cash flow is converted to a future value at the end of the project’s life, compounded at the cost of capital. These values are then summed up to get the project’s future value (PFV). The MIRR is the interest rate that equates the project’s cost (PVCost), or cash outflows, with the future value of the project’s cash inflows at the end of the project (PVPFV).1 Because each future value is computed using the cost of capital as the interest rate, the reinvestment rate problem is eliminated.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 10.2
The Lemonade Stand versus the Convenience Store

Situation

Suppose you work for an entrepreneur who owns a number of small businesses in Fresno, California, as well as a small piece of property near California State University at Fresno, that he believes would be an ideal site for a student-oriented convenience store. His 7-year-old son, who happens to be in the office after school, says he has a better idea: his father should open a lemonade stand. Your boss tells you to find the NPV and IRR for both projects, assuming a 10 percent discount rate. After collecting data, you present the following analysis:

Year	Lemonade Stand	Convenience Store
0	−$1,000	−$1,000,000
1	        850	        372,000
2	        850	        372,000
3	        850	        372,000
4	        850	        372,000
IRR	   76.2%	           18.0%
NPV	  $1,694	    $179,190
Assuming the projects are mutually exclusive, which should be selected?



We can set up the equation for the MIRR in the same way we set up Equation 10.4 for the IRR:

(10.5)
To compute the MIRR, we have to make two preliminary calculations. First, we calculate the value of PVCost, which is the present value of the cash outflows that make up the investment cost of the project. Since for most capital projects, the investment cost cash flows are incurred at the beginning of the project, t = 0, there is often no need to calculate a present value. If investment costs are incurred over time (t > 0), then the cash flows must be discounted at the cost of capital.

Second, we need to compute the project’s future value (PFV). To do this, we find the future value of each operating cash flow at the end of the project’s life, compounded at the cost of capital. We then sum up these future values to get the PFV. Mathematically, the PFV can be expressed as:

where:

PFV	=	the project’s future value
CFt	=	cash flow from operations in period t
k	=	the cost of capital
n	=	the project life
Once we have computed the values of PVCost and PFV, we use Equation 10.5 to compute the MIRR. Note that by combining intermediate cash flows into a single future value, MIRR has the added advantage of always yielding a conventional cash flow.

To illustrate, let’s return to the Ford Motor Company example shown in Exhibit 10.8. Recall that the cost of the project is $560, incurred at t = 0, and that the discount rate is 12 percent. To determine the MIRR for the project, we start by calculating the future value of the cash flows, as shown on the following time line:


The project’s future value of $809.86 equals the sum of the $240 in Year 1 compounded at 12 percent for two years plus the $240 in Year 2 compounded at 12 percent for one year plus the $240 in Year 3. Mathematically, this calculation is:

With the information that the cost of the project is $560 and the PFV is $809.86, we can calculate the MIRR using Equation 10.5:

At 13.09 percent, the MIRR is higher than Ford’s cost of capital of 12 percent, so the project should be accepted.

IRR versus NPV: A Final Comment
The IRR method, as noted, is an important alternative to the NPV method. As we have seen, it accounts for the time value of money, which is not true of methods such as the payback period and accounting rate of return. Furthermore, the IRR technique has great intuitive appeal. Many business practitioners are in the habit of thinking in terms of rates of return, whether the rates relate to their common-stock portfolios or their firms’ capital expenditures. To these practitioners, the IRR method just seems to make sense. Indeed, we suspect that the IRR’s popularity with business managers results more from its simple intuitive appeal than from its merit.

On the downside, we have seen that the IRR method has several flaws. For example, IRR can’t be used effectively for projects with unconventional cash flows, and IRR can lead to incorrect investment decisions when it is used to choose between mutually exclusive projects. MIRR addresses some of the shortcomings of IRR; namely, it does not assume that project proceeds are reinvested at the IRR, and it eliminates issues associated with unconventional project cash flows. Nonetheless, we believe that NPV should be the primary method used to make capital budgeting decisions. Investment decisions made using NPV are always consistent with the goal of maximizing the value of the firm, even when discriminating between mutually exclusive projects. Finally, it is important to note that the IRR, MIRR, and NPV methods all require a set of projected cash flows over the life of the project and a discount rate. Thus, using IRR or MIRR, rather than NPV, does not require less effort from financial managers.

10.6 Investment Decisions with Capital Rationing
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain how the profitability index can be used to rank projects when a firm faces capital rationing and describe the limitations that apply to the profitability index.
Our discussion of capital budgeting so far has focused on determining whether an individual project creates value for stockholders. Although the analytical methods we have discussed are critical components of the capital budgeting process, they do not tell us what to do when, as is often the case, a firm does not have enough money to invest in all available positive NPV projects. In other words, they do not tell us how to identify the bundle or combination of positive NPV projects that creates the greatest total value for stockholders when there are capital constraints or, as we called it earlier in this chapter, capital rationing.

In an ideal world we could accept all positive NPV projects because we would be able to finance them. If managers and investors agreed on which projects had positive NPVs, investors would provide capital to those projects because returns from them would be greater than the returns the investors could earn elsewhere in the capital markets. However, the world is not ideal, and firms often cannot invest in all of the available projects with positive NPVs. It can be difficult for outside investors to accurately assess the risks and returns associated with the firm’s projects. Consequently, investors may require returns for their capital that are too high, and the firm may face capital constraints. Managers might be forced to reject some positive NPV projects because investors are not providing enough capital to fund those projects at reasonable rates.

Capital Rationing in a Single Period
The basic principle that we follow in choosing the set of projects that creates the greatest value in a given period is to select the projects that yield the largest value per dollar invested. We can do this by computing the profitability index (PI) for each project and choosing the projects with the largest profitability indexes until we run out of money. The profitability index is computed as follows:

profitability index (PI) a measure of the value a project generates for each dollar invested in that project

(10.6)
where initial investment is the up-front investment required to fund the project.

To illustrate, let’s suppose you run a lawn mowing business and are considering buying a new lawn mower. Assume that the new mower would cost $2,000 and would bring in net cash flows of $7,000 for four years. With a discount rate of 10 percent, the NPV of this mower is $20,189, and its PI is calculated as follows:

This means that an investment in the new mower is expected to generate $11.09 of value for every dollar invested.

Now consider the case in which we have several projects to choose from in a given year but do not have enough money to invest in all of them. For example, suppose that we have identified the four positive NPV projects listed in Exhibit 10.12 and have only $10,000 to invest. How do we choose from among the four projects when we cannot afford to invest in all of them?

Our objective in a case such as this is to identify the bundle or combination of positive NPV projects that creates the greatest total value for stockholders. The PI is helpful in such a situation because it helps us choose the projects that create the most value per dollar invested. We use the PI to do this by following a four-step procedure:

Calculate the PI for each project.
Rank the projects from highest PI to lowest PI.
Starting at the top of the list (the project with the highest PI) and working your way down (to the project with the lowest PI), select the projects that the firm can afford.
Repeat the third step by starting with the second project on the list, the third project on the list, and so on to make sure that a more valuable bundle cannot be identified.
Applying this process to the projects in Exhibit 10.12, we would choose to accept Projects A, B, and D. We would begin by choosing Projects A and B because they have the largest PIs and we have enough money to invest in both. Since choosing Projects A and B means we would no longer have enough money to invest in Project C, we would skip C and choose D, for which we do have enough money. Projects A, B, and D would generate a total of $7,500 in total value for stockholders. Following the fourth step reveals that no other combination of projects has a larger total NPV than Projects A, B, and D, so we would select these projects.

Learning by Doing Application 10.4 and Decision Making Example 10.3 illustrate the calculation of PIs for projects and their use in making investment decisions.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 10.3
Ranking Investment Alternatives

Situation

The profitability index concept does not apply only to a firm’s investments in projects. It can also apply to your personal investments. For example, suppose that you have just inherited $50,000 and want to invest it in ways that create as much value as possible. After researching investment alternatives, you have identified five investments that you believe will have positive NPVs. You estimate that the NPVs and PIs for these investments are as follows:

Project	Investment	NPV	PI
Buy a new car for your business	$20,000	$10,000	1.500
Buy a duplex apartment near campus	  50,000	  22,500	1.450
Start a small moving business	  25,000	  10,000	1.400
Invest in your roommate’s internet business	  15,000	    5,000	1.333
Buy a collection of old comic books	     5,000	    1,000	1.200
Which investment(s) should you choose?



Capital Rationing across Multiple Periods
The PI concept is relatively straightforward and easy to apply if you are choosing among projects in a single period. However, if you are faced with capital rationing over several years, the investments you choose this year can affect your ability to make investments in future years. This can happen if you plan on reinvesting some or all of the cash flows generated by the projects you invest in this year. In such a situation, you cannot rely solely on the PI to identify the projects you should invest in this year. You must maximize the total NPV across all of the years in which you will be investing.

Let’s look more closely at how multiperiod concerns can cause you to deviate from PI-based investment choices in a given year. Suppose you operate a business that will generate $10,000 per year for new investments. Furthermore, suppose that today (Year 0) you are choosing among Projects A, B, C, and D in Exhibit 10.13 and that, based on the PIs of the individual projects, you choose to invest in Projects A, B, and D. The total NPV from these projects will be $7,500, and the total Year 1 cash flow from them will be $9,000 ($5,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $9,000).

Now suppose that you expect Projects F, G, and H to be available next year (Year 1). If other operations yield $10,000 for investments next year, you will have a total of $19,000 to invest in Year 1. With this amount of money, you can invest in Projects F and H, which require a total investment of $15,000 and have a combined NPV of $9,546 ($9,091 + $455 = $9,546). Therefore, in Year 0 dollars, the total value created from investing activities over the two years will be $17,046 ($7,500 + $9,546 = $17,046).

While $17,046 is a lot of value for a total investment of $25,000 ($10,000 today and $15,000 in Year 1), you could do better. Notice that if, instead of Projects A, B, and D, you invest in Projects A, C, and D today, you will have enough cash in Year 1 to invest in Projects F and G. This strategy would yield a total NPV of $21,955 ($5,000 + $1,000 + $500 + $9,091 + $6,364 = $21,955)! Ranking and selecting the projects today based on the PI would have yielded a bundle of projects over two years with a lower NPV. This illustrates an important limitation of the profitability index. It does not tell us enough to make informed decisions over multiple periods. Solving a multiple-period problem requires the application of more advanced analytical techniques, such as linear programming, that are beyond the scope of this book.

EXHIBIT 10.13 Investing Across Multiple Periods

Investment decision making with capital rationing becomes more complex when multiple periods are involved. This exhibit shows the yearly free cash flows, NPV, and profitability index (PI) for the four positive NPV projects in Exhibit 10.12 and for three other positive-NPV projects that are expected to become available in Year 1.

10.7 Capital Budgeting in Practice
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the benefits of postaudit and periodic reviews of capital projects.
Capital expenditures are big-ticket items in the U.S. economy. According to the World Bank, capital investment in the United States totaled $4.32 trillion in 2018. Capital investments can represent large expenditures for individual firms, though the amount spent can vary widely from year to year. For example, AT&T invested heavily in its communications businesses in 2019, and its $19.4 billion in capital expenditures that year exceeded those of all but a very small number of firms in the world. More typical are the capital expenditure totals for Caterpillar, Microsoft, and Kellogg Company, which are shown in the following table. Given the large dollar amounts and the strategic importance of capital expenditures, it is no surprise that corporate managers spend considerable time and energy analyzing capital projects.

Company	2019 Capital Expenditures ($ billions)	2019 Sales ($ billions)	Capital Expenditures as a Percentage of Sales
AT&T, Inc.	$19.4	$181.2	   10.7%
Caterpillar, Inc.	    2.7	    53.8	  5.0
Microsoft Corp.	  15.4	  143.0	10.8
Kellogg Company	    0.6	    13.6	  4.4
Practitioners’ Methods of Choice
Because of the importance of capital budgeting, over the years a number of surveys have asked financial managers what techniques they actually use in making capital investment decisions. Exhibit 10.14, which summarizes the results from two such studies, reveals significant changes over time. As shown, in 1981 only 16.5 percent of the financial managers surveyed frequently used the NPV approach, and the payback period and accounting rate of return approaches were used even less frequently. Most firms, 65.3 percent, used the IRR method. However, practices changed in the 1980s and 1990s. By 1999, 74.9 percent of the firms surveyed were frequently using the NPV technique, 75.7 percent were using the IRR, and 56.7 percent were using the payback period method. As you can see, the most recent findings reflect a much better alignment between what practitioners do and the theory discussed in this chapter. As you can also see, many financial managers use multiple capital budgeting tools.

EXHIBIT 10.14 Capital Budgeting Techniques Used by Business Firms

The exhibit summarizes evidence from two studies that examined the use of capital budgeting techniques by businesses. As you can see, over time more firms have come to use the NPV and IRR techniques. Surprisingly, though, even in 1999, 20.3 percent still computed the accounting rate of return.

Capital Budgeting Tool	Percent of Surveyed Firms That Use the Technique Frequently
1981	1999
Payback period	       5.0%	    56.7%
Accounting rate of return (ARR)	10.7	20.3
Internal rate of return (IRR)	65.3	75.7
Net present value (NPV)	16.5	74.9

Postaudit and Periodic Reviews
Some firms have policies that require periodic reviews of the status of ongoing capital projects and postaudit reviews of completed capital projects. In a postaudit review, management compares the actual performance of a project with what was projected in the capital budgeting proposal. For example, suppose a new microchip production line was expected to earn a 20 percent IRR, but the project’s actual IRR turned out to be 9 percent. A postaudit examination would determine why the project failed to achieve its expected financial goals. Project reviews keep all people involved in the capital budgeting process honest because they know that the project and their performance will be reviewed and that they will be held accountable for the results.

postaudit review an audit to compare actual project results with the results projected in the capital budgeting proposal

Periodic reviews of the status of ongoing capital projects provide useful information about a firm’s business plan, including the cash flow projections and the operating cost assumptions. Business plans are management’s best estimates of future events at the time they are prepared, but as new information becomes available, managers use this information to adjust their plans.

Managers also use information from periodic reviews to evaluate the people responsible for implementing a capital project. In doing this, they determine whether the project’s revenues and expenses are meeting projections. If the project is not proceeding according to plan, they try to determine whether the problem is a flawed plan or poor execution by the implementation team. If the problem is poor execution, the project’s performance might be improved by putting a new team in place.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Discuss why capital budgeting decisions are the most important investment decisions made by a firm’s management.

Capital budgeting is the process by which management decides which productive assets the firm should invest in. Because capital expenditures involve large amounts of money, are critical to achieving the firm’s strategic plan, define the firm’s line of business over the long term, and determine the firm’s profitability for years to come, they are the most important investment decisions made by management.

2 Explain the benefits of using the net present value (NPV) method to analyze capital expenditure decisions and calculate the NPV for a capital project.

The net present value (NPV) method leads to better investment decisions than other techniques because it (1) uses the discounted cash flow valuation approach, which accounts for the time value of money, and (2) provides a direct measure of how much a capital project is expected to increase the dollar value of the firm. Thus, NPV is consistent with the top management goal of maximizing stockholder value. NPV calculations are described in Section 10.2 and Learning by Doing Application 10.1.

3 Describe the strengths and weaknesses of the payback period as a capital expenditure decision-making tool and compute the payback period for a capital project.

The payback period is the length of time it will take for the cash flows from a project to recover the cost of the project. The payback period is widely used, mainly because it is simple to apply and easy to understand. It also provides a simple measure of liquidity risk because it tells management how quickly the firm will get its money back. The payback period has a number of shortcomings, however. For one thing, the payback period, as most commonly computed, ignores the time value of money. We can overcome this objection by using discounted cash flows to calculate the payback period. Regardless of how the payback period is calculated, however, it fails to take account of cash flows recovered after the payback period. Thus, the payback period is biased in favor of short-lived projects. Also, the determination of what payback period is acceptable can be arbitrary. Payback period calculations are described in Section 10.3 and Learning by Doing Application 10.2.

4 Explain why the accounting rate of return (ARR) is not recommended for use as a capital expenditure decision-making tool.

The ARR is based on accounting numbers, such as book value and net income, rather than cash flow data. As such, it is not a true rate of return. Instead of discounting a project’s cash flows over time, it simply gives us a number based on average figures from the income statement and balance sheet. Furthermore, as with the payback method, there is no economic rationale for establishing the hurdle rate. Finally, the ARR does not account for the relative sizes of projects when a choice between projects of different sizes must be made.

5 Compute the internal rate of return (IRR) for a capital project and discuss the conditions under which the IRR technique and the NPV technique produce different results.

The IRR is the expected rate of return for a capital project; it is the discount rate that equates the present value of a project’s expected cash inflows to the present value of the project’s outflows—in other words, it is the discount rate at which the NPV is equal to zero. Calculations are shown in Section 10.5 and Learning by Doing Application 10.3. If a project’s IRR is greater than the required rate of return, the cost of capital, the project is accepted. The IRR rule often gives the same investment decision for a project as the NPV rule. However, the IRR method does have operational pitfalls that can lead to incorrect decisions. Specifically, when a project’s cash flows are unconventional, the IRR calculation may yield no IRR or more than one IRR. In addition, the IRR technique cannot be used to rank projects that are mutually exclusive because the project with the highest IRR may not be the project that would add the greatest value to the firm if accepted—that is, the project with the highest NPV.

6 Explain how the profitability index can be used to rank projects when a firm faces capital rationing and describe the limitations that apply to the profitability index.

The profitability index (PI) aids in the process of choosing the most valuable bundle of projects that the firm can afford. It is a measure of value received per dollar invested, which can be used to rank projects in a given period. As with the IRR, there is a scale problem with the PI. However, by using the PI and the four-step procedure in Section 10.6 we can identify the most valuable bundle of projects. The major limitation of the PI is that, although it can be used to rank projects in a given period, it can lead to less valuable project choices when considering capital investments over multiple years.

7 Explain the benefits of postaudit and periodic reviews of capital projects.

A postaudit review enables managers to determine whether a project’s goals were met and to quantify the actual benefits or costs of the project. By conducting these reviews, managers can avoid making similar mistakes in future projects, learn to better recognize opportunities, and keep the people involved in the budgeting process honest. A periodic review enables managers to assess the impact of changing information and market conditions on the value of a project that is already underway.

Going Green: Can Automakers Invest in Environmental Solutions?

As concerns about global warming increase, many corporations and governments around the world are working to limit the production of so-called greenhouse gases (GHG) that have been linked to climate change. Indeed, after taking office, President Biden committed the U.S. to limiting carbon emissions by rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement. The administration also introduced policies encouraging the use of solar and wind power for producing electricity as alternatives to coal and natural gas. More recently, both China and the European Union have announced major changes to limit carbon emissions, including restrictions on the production of gasoline powered vehicles.

Many businesses have responded to the increased focus on climate change. For example, a group of automakers, including General Motors (GM), has said they are looking forward to working with the Biden administration “… to advance the shared goals of reducing emissions and realizing the benefits of an electric future.” So, what are greenhouse gases and how are they related to global warming? What is the Paris Climate Agreement? And what do automakers have to do with all of this?

Global Warming and Greenhouse Gases

Global warming is defined as the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system due to human activities that increase greenhouse gases.1 Climate data over the last 160 years suggests that the global average temperature has increased by over 1 degree Celsius to date, with ever increasing rates of change. There is evidence suggesting that global warming, and resulting climate change, negatively affects the environment by way of drought, flooding, rising sea levels, and increased intensity and frequency of severe weather. The majority of scientists today agree that greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide emitted when fossil fuels (e.g., coal, diesel, natural gas, and oil) are burned, are major contributors to climate change.

The Paris Climate Agreement

Given concerns about the social and economic costs of climate change, representatives from 196 countries around the world met on December 12, 2015, in Paris, France to join the Paris Climate Agreement. The agreement is a voluntary, but legally binding, international treaty on climate change committing the signatories to develop and implement plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius above levels in the 1850-1900 “pre-industrial” period (and if possible, less than 1.5 degrees). Having already surpassed 1-degree above the pre-industrial level, the 2-degree threshold is seen by many scientists as critical in reducing the risks of climate change associated with global warming.2


The Auto Industry and General Motors

Automakers, including GM, are deeply involved in issues related to fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that fuel used for transportation of people and goods is the single largest source of carbon dioxide emissions (with the production of electricity being the second largest).3 This is largely due to the reliance on vehicles powered by internal combustion engines that use fossil fuels.

In late January 2021, GM announced a strategic repositioning of the company for an “all-electric vehicle future.” This move was intended to both to address consumer concerns over the environment, and counter the rapidly increasing market share of competitors such as Toyota and Tesla in the hybrid and all-electric vehicle market. GM management said that the company would eliminate emissions from new light duty vehicles by 2035, and be carbon-neutral in its global operations (i.e., have net zero carbon emissions) by 2040.4 This would include cutting emissions where possible and using renewable energy sources such as wind and solar to power manufacturing facilities.

GM also announced plans to invest $27 billion over the next five years to produce electric and autonomous vehicles. This record investment for the firm includes updating manufacturing facilities in Michigan and Tennessee to produce vehicles using the firm’s new Battery Electric Vehicle 3 platform. GM will also build a new plant in Ohio to manufacture the firm’s new, more efficient and less costly Ultium lithium-ion batteries. GM’s Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra has said of the firm’s strategy: “I really see long-term value creation for General Motors and for our shareholders.”


Will Producing Electric Vehicles Lower Emissions?

Some have applauded the efforts of GM and other automakers as important steps in an attempt reducing GHG emissions and working toward the goals of the Paris Agreement aimed at limiting global warming. Others, however, have expressed skepticism, and pointed out that GM’s investment might be risky for their shareholders.

While EVs produce little GHGs, the sources of electricity that are used to produce and charge vehicles and their batteries can produce GHGs. For example, vehicles produced or charged using electricity produced by solar power will result in less total GHGs compared with those that rely on electricity generated by coal-fired power plants.

Moreover, despite the focus on EVs, automakers will continue to produce vehicles including mid- and heavy-duty trucks that rely on internal combustion engines. One survey reported that about 40 percent of U.S. adults asked would consider buying an EV in the next decade.5 However, with the average price tag of an EV at $19,000 more than a gas-powered vehicle, it is unclear how many consumers will actually make the switch.6

It has also been suggested that the light duty vehicles that the auto manufacturers are focusing on in their EV strategy – particularly personal vehicles – contribute relatively little to overall GHG emissions. In the U.S., for example, the EPA reported that light duty vehicles accounted for about 17 percent of total U.S. emissions in 2019. As a result, it has been suggested that efforts to reduce emissions would be more effective if targeted elsewhere, for example at electricity generation.

Having said that, in other regions of the world, such as China and the European Union, the shift to EVs looks more certain as laws have been passed that require the reduction or elimination of new vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.7

Employees

Investments such as those that GM and other automakers are undertaking, and a move to EVs more generally, will result in changes in the types of employees that the auto and related industries will need. There will be increased demand for employees with experience in EV technology at firms that produce automobiles, batteries, and electric charging stations. But expanded production of EVs will likely result in the loss of other jobs. For example, there will be less demand for employees with experience in the manufacturing of internal combustion engines in the auto industry, and for employees in the related auto parts and auto services industries as EVs require fewer moving parts, and do not need gas, oil changes, or transmission fluids.

Communities

While many view the growing market for EVs as environmentally beneficial, there are potential downsides to adopting this technology. For example, the lithium-ion batteries used to power EVs have been linked to adverse environmental and social effects. Specifically, much of the world’s cobalt, a critical input to lithium-ion batteries, is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where there are concerns about abusive child labor practices, a lack of worker protections from cobalt’s toxic effects, and the pollution of local communities from mining operations. In other areas, such as Chile and the U.S, the potential for existing and planned lithium mines to damage the environment has also attracted the scrutiny of local communities and environmentalists.

Will EV Strategies Put Automakers in High Gear?

It is clear that there are pressures from politicians and many segments of society to reduce GHGs. It remains an open question, however, as to how effective the transition to EVs will be, and the impact that the automakers’ EV strategies will have on their shareholders and other stakeholders.

Discussion Questions
Identify 3 sets of stakeholders at GM and explain how each might i) benefit and ii) be harmed in some way from the firm’s plan to focus on the production of EVs in place of fossil-fuel powered vehicles.
As noted in the case, light duty vehicles currently contribute about 17 percent to the total U.S. emissions. Identify 2 factors that would limit reductions in emissions when drivers switch to EVs.
Notes
1 As we pointed out in Chapters 5 and 6, financial decision-making problems can be solved either by discounting cash flows to the beginning of the project or by using compounding to find the future value of cash flows at the end of a project’s life.

On November 24, 2020, news outlets reported rumors that Salesforce, a large company specializing in cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) services and business apps, was in negotiations to buy Slack Technologies Inc., the developers of the channel-based Slack messaging system. Investors in the stock market appeared to be skeptical that the acquisition was good for Salesforce. By Tuesday, December 1, the company’s stock price had declined from around $261 to $240 per share. After the market closed on Tuesday, the managers of Salesforce issued a press release confirming that they had agreed to pay an estimated $27.7 billion in cash and stock for Slack Technologies Inc. By the end of the following day, Salesforce’s stock price had dropped again to $221, a decline of just over 15 percent since rumors of the deal surfaced.

The decrease in the price of Salesforce stock suggests that investors thought that the company was overpaying for the acquisition. The decline in the stock price represented an estimated $36.6 billion decrease [($221 − $261) × 915 million shares outstanding = −$36.6 billion] in the overall value of Salesforce’s shares. In contrast, over the same time period, Slack Technologies Inc.’s stock price increased more than 40 percent, while the return on the S&P stock market index was essentially unchanged.

In the December 1 press release announcing the acquisition, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff said “This is a match made in heaven. Together, Salesforce and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software and transform the way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world.” However, observers questioned the deal, with one analyst suggesting that it was costly, unnecessary, and risky given the dominance of Microsoft’s competing Teams platform.

When the managers of Salesforce announced their plans to acquire Slack, they were announcing a $27.7 billion investment. This investment was viewed by stock market investors from the same perspective as any capital project that a firm might pursue. Investors evaluated whether the net present value (NPV) of the cash flows from the acquisition would be positive or negative. The model used by financial analysts to estimate this NPV is the same one you saw in Chapter 10. The decrease in the value of Salesforce’s stock from the first rumor of the deal through confirmation by Salesforce’s management reflected investors’ estimates of the NPV of the decision to purchase Slack.

In Chapter 10 we stressed understanding the NPV concept and other project valuation models, as well as the mechanics of discounting project cash flows. This chapter focuses on what project cash flows are discounted and how they are calculated and used in practice. The topics covered in this chapter are central to the goal of value creation. It is necessary to understand them in order to determine which capital projects have positive NPVs and which projects have negative NPVs. Only if you can do this will you be able to choose projects that create value.

Chapter Preview
In Chapter 10 we saw that capital budgeting involves comparing the benefits and costs associated with a project to determine whether the project creates value for stockholders. These benefits and costs are reflected in the cash flows that the project is expected to produce. The NPV is a dollar measure of the amount by which the present value of the benefits exceeds the present value of the costs. Chapters 11 through 13 discuss how analysts actually apply the capital budgeting concepts introduced in Chapter 10. This chapter and Chapter 12 focus on cash flows, while Chapter 13 covers concepts related to the discount rate.

We begin this chapter with a discussion of how to calculate the cash flows used to compute the NPV of a project. We then present five rules to follow when you calculate cash flows. We also address some concepts that will help you better understand cash flow calculations.

Next, we discuss how analysts actually forecast a project’s cash flows. Since the cash flows generated by a project will almost certainly differ from the forecasts, it is important to have a framework that helps minimize errors and ensures that forecasts are internally consistent. We discuss such a framework in this part of the chapter.

Finally, we examine some special cases that arise in capital budgeting problems. For example, we describe how analysts adjust cash flows to choose between projects that have different lives, how to determine when an existing piece of equipment should be replaced, how to determine the cost of using excess capacity for a project, and when to harvest (or sell) an asset.

11.1 Calculating Project Cash Flows
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain why incremental after-tax free cash flows are relevant in evaluating a project and calculate them for a project.
We begin our discussion of cash flows in capital budgeting by describing the mechanics of cash flow calculations and the rules for estimating the cash flows for individual projects. You will see that the approach we use to calculate project cash flows is similar to that used to calculate the cash flow to investors discussed in Chapter 3. However, there are two very important differences. First, the cash flows used in capital budgeting calculations are based on forecasts of future cash revenues, expenses, taxes, and investment outlays. In contrast, in Chapter 3 we focused on calculating historical cash flows to investors using accounting statements rather than the future cash flows that might be generated by the firm. Second, in capital budgeting we focus on estimating the cash flows we expect an individual project to produce in the future, which we refer to as incremental after-tax free cash flows. In contrast, the cash flow to investors in Chapter 3 is a measure of the cash flows generated by the entire firm.

Building Intuition
Capital Budgeting Is Forward Looking

In capital budgeting, we estimate the NPV of the cash flows that a project is expected to produce in the future. In other words, all of the cash flow estimates are forward looking. This is very different from using historical accounting statements to estimate cash flows.

Incremental After-Tax Free Cash Flows
The cash flows we discount in an NPV analysis are the incremental after-tax free cash flows that are expected from the project. The term incremental refers to the fact that these cash flows reflect how much the firm’s total after-tax free cash flows will change if the project is adopted. Thus, we define the incremental after-tax free cash flows (FCF) for a project as the total after-tax free cash flows the firm would produce with the project, less the total after-tax free cash flows the firm would produce without the project.

incremental after-tax free cash flows the difference between the total after-tax free cash flows at a firm with a project and the total after-tax free cash flows at the same firm without that project; a measure of a project’s total impact on the free cash flows at a firm

(11.1)
In other words, FCFProject equals the net effect the project will have on the firm’s cash revenues, costs, taxes, and investment outlays. These are the cash flows investors care about.

Throughout the rest of this chapter, we will refer to the total incremental after-tax free cash flows associated with a project simply as the FCF for the project. For convenience, we will drop the “Project” subscript from the FCF in Equation 11.1.

The FCF for a project is what we generically referred to as NCF in Chapter 10. The term free cash flows, which is commonly used in practice, refers to the fact that the firm is free to distribute these cash flows to creditors and stockholders because these are the cash flows that are left over after a firm has made necessary investments in working capital and long-term assets. The cash flows associated with financing a project (cash outflows or inflows to or from creditors or stockholders) are not included in the FCF calculation because, as we will discuss in Chapter 13, these are accounted for in the discount rate that is used in an NPV analysis. All of these points will become clearer as we discuss the FCF calculation next.

The FCF Calculation
The FCF calculation is illustrated in Exhibit 11.1. Let’s begin with an overall review of how the calculation is done. After that, we will look more closely at details of the calculation.

When we calculate the FCFs for a project, we first compute the incremental cash flow from operations (CF Opns) for each year during the project’s life. This is the cash flow that the project is expected to generate after all operating expenses and taxes have been paid. To obtain the FCF, we then subtract the incremental capital expenditures (Cap Exp) and the incremental additions to working capital (Add WC) required for the project. Cap Exp and Add WC represent the net investments in long-term assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and in working capital items, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable, which must be made if the project is pursued.

incremental cash flow from operations (CF Opns) the cash flow that a project generates after all operating expenses and taxes have been paid but before any cash outflows for investments

incremental capital expenditures (Cap Exp) the net investments in property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets that must be made if a project is pursued

incremental additions to working capital (Add WC) the net investments in working capital items, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable, that must be made if the project is pursued

As we noted earlier, the calculation of free cash flows for capital budgeting, which is summarized in Exhibit 11.1, is very similar to the calculation of the cash flows to investors that we discussed in Chapter 3. This should not be surprising since managers evaluate projects based on the present value of the cash flows they are expected to produce for their firms’ investors. Nevertheless, there is an important computational difference between the cash flow calculations in Chapters 3 and 11. In Exhibit 11.1 the taxes for a project analysis are computed by multiplying the project’s operating profit (EBIT) by the firm’s marginal tax rate. This calculation gives us the taxes that the firm will owe on a project if no debt is used to finance that project. In contrast, the calculation in Chapter 3 uses the actual taxes paid by the firm, including the effect that interest deductions have on the taxes owed. It is true that interest payments will reduce the taxable income from a project if any debt financing is used. However, we ignore this reduction when evaluating a project for two reasons. First, we want to exclude the effects associated with how the project is financed in order to isolate the cash flows from the project itself. Second, as we discuss in Chapter 13, the cost of both debt and equity financing for a project, including the impact of using debt financing on the firm’s tax obligations, are reflected in the discount rate. Doing the calculation this way makes it easier to estimate the NPV of a project under alternative financial structures.

EXHIBIT 11.1 The Free Cash Flow Calculation for a Project

This exhibit shows how the incremental after-tax free cash flow (FCF) for a project is calculated. The FCF equals the change in the firm’s cash income, excluding interest expense, that the project generates, plus depreciation and amortization for the project, minus all required capital expenditures and investments in working capital. FCF also equals the incremental after-tax cash flow from operations minus the net capital expenditures and investments in working capital required for the project.

Building Intuition
Incremental After-Tax Free Cash Flows Are What Stockholders Care About in Capital Budgeting

When evaluating a project, managers focus on the FCF that the project is expected to produce because that is what stockholders care about. The FCFs reflect the impact of the project on the firm’s overall cash flows. They also represent the additional cash flows that can be distributed to security holders if the project is accepted. Only after-tax cash flows matter because these are the cash flows that are actually available for distribution after taxes are paid to the government.

Since the FCF calculation gives us the after-tax cash flows from operations over and above what is necessary to make any required investments, the FCFs for a project are the cash flows that the firm’s investors can expect to receive from the project. This is why we discount the FCFs when we compute the NPV.

The formula for the FCF calculation can also be written as:

(11.2)
where revenue is the incremental revenue (net sales) associated with the project, D&A is the incremental depreciation and amortization associated with the project, and t is the firm’s marginal tax rate.

incremental depreciation and amortization (D&A) the depreciation and amortization charges that are associated with a project

firm’s marginal tax rate (t) the tax rate that is applied to each additional dollar of earnings at a firm

Let’s use Equation 11.2 to work through an example. Suppose you are considering purchasing a new truck for your plumbing business. This truck will increase revenues $50,000 and operating expenses $30,000 in the next year. Depreciation and amortization charges for the truck will equal $10,000 next year, and your firm’s marginal tax rate will be 25 percent. Capital expenditures of $3,000 will be required to offset wear and tear on the truck, but no additions to working capital will be required. To calculate the FCF for the project in the next year, you can simply substitute the appropriate values into Equation 11.2:

The FCF calculated with Equation 11.2 equals the total annual cash flow the firm will produce with the project less the total cash flow the firm will produce without the project. Even so, it is important to note that it is not necessary to actually estimate the firm’s total cash flows in an NPV analysis. We need only estimate the cash outflows and inflows that arise as a direct result of the project in order to value it. The idea that we can evaluate the cash flows from a project independently of the cash flows for the firm is known as the stand-alone principle. The stand-alone principle says that we can treat the project as if it were a stand-alone firm that has its own revenue, expenses, and investment requirements. NPV analysis compares the present value of the FCF from this stand-alone firm with the cost of the project.

stand-alone principle the principle that allows us to treat each project as a stand-alone firm when we perform an NPV analysis

To fully understand the stand-alone principle, it is helpful to consider an example. Suppose that you own shares of stock in Twitter Inc., and that Twitter’s stock is currently selling for $44.00 per share. Now suppose that Twitter’s management announces it will immediately invest $799 million in data centers that are expected to produce after-tax cash flows of $200 million per year forever. Since Twitter has 799 million shares outstanding, this means that the investment will equal $1.00 per share ($799 million/799 million shares = $1.00 per share). The annual increase in Twitter’s cash flows is expected to be $0.25 per share per year ($200 million/799 million shares = $0.250 per share). How should this announcement affect the value of a share of Twitter stock?

Given that the project generates $0.250 in incremental cash flow per share forever, the present value of the project can be valued as a perpetuity. If the appropriate cost of capital for the project is 10 percent, then from Equation 9.2 and the discussion in Chapter 10, we know that the value of a share of Twitter’s stock should increase by D/R = $0.250/0.10 = $2.50 less the $1.00 invested, or $1.50, making each share of Twitter stock worth $44.00 + $1.50 = $45.50 after the announcement. This example illustrates how the stand-alone principle allows us to simply add the value of a project’s cash flows to the value of the firm’s other cash flows to obtain the total value of the firm with the project.

Cash Flows from Operations
Let’s examine Exhibit 11.1 in more detail to better understand why FCF is calculated as it is. First, note that the incremental cash flow from operations, CF Opns, equals the incremental net operating profits after tax (NOPAT) plus D&A.

incremental net operating profits after tax (NOPAT) a measure of the impact of a project on the firm’s cash net income, excluding the effects of any interest expenses associated with financing the project

If you refer back to the discussion of the income statement in Chapter 3, you will notice that NOPAT is essentially a cash flow measure of the incremental net income from the project without interest expenses. In other words, it is the impact of the project on the firm’s cash flow, excluding the effects of any interest expenses associated with financing the project. We exclude interest expenses when calculating NOPAT for an NPV analysis because, as we mentioned earlier, the cost of financing a project is reflected in the discount rate.

We use the firm’s marginal tax rate, t, to calculate NOPAT because the profits from a project are assumed to be incremental to the firm. Since the firm already pays taxes, the appropriate tax rate for FCF calculations is the tax rate that the firm will pay on any additional profits that are earned because the project is adopted. You may recall from Chapter 3 that this rate is the marginal tax rate. We will discuss taxes in more detail later in this chapter.

We add incremental depreciation and amortization, D&A, to NOPAT when calculating CF Opns because, as in the accounting statement of cash flows, D&A represents a noncash charge that reduces the firm’s tax obligation. Note that we subtract D&A before computing the taxes that the firm would pay on the incremental earnings for the project. This accounts for the ability of the firm to deduct D&A when computing taxes. However, since D&A is a noncash charge, we have to add it back to NOPAT in order to get the cash flow from operations right.

The net effect of subtracting D&A, computing the taxes, and then adding back D&A is to reduce the taxes attributable to earnings from the project. For example, suppose that EBITDA for a project is $100, D&A is $50, and t is 30 percent. If we did not subtract D&A before computing taxes and add it back to compute CF Opns, the taxes owed for the project would be $100 × 0.30 = $30, and CF Opns would be $100 − $30 = $70. This would understate CF Opns from this project by $15, since deducting D&A reduces the firm’s tax obligation by this amount. With this deduction, the correct tax obligation is ($100 − $50) × 0.30 = $15, and the correct CF Opns is $100 − $15 = $85. We get exactly this value when we compute CF Opns as shown in Exhibit 11.1 and Equation 11.2:

Since Revenue − Op Ex = EBITDA, as shown in Exhibit 11.1, we can write:

Cash Flows Associated with Capital Expenditures and Net Working Capital
Once we have estimated CF Opns, we simply subtract cash flows associated with the required investments to obtain the FCF for a project in a particular period. Investments can be required to purchase long-term tangible assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, to purchase intangible assets, such as patents, mailing lists, and brand names, or to fund current assets, such as cash and marketable securities, accounts receivables, and inventories.

tangible assets physical assets such as property, plant, and equipment

intangible assets nonphysical assets such as patents, mailing lists, and brand names

current assets assets, such as cash and marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventories, that are expected to be liquidated (collected or sold) within one year

It is important to recognize that all investments that are incremental to a project must be accounted for. The most obvious investments are those in the land, buildings, and machinery and equipment that are acquired for the project. However, investments in intangible assets can also be required. For example, a manufacturing firm may purchase the right to use a particular production technology. Incremental investments in long-term tangible assets and intangible assets are collectively referred to as incremental capital expenditures (Cap Exp).

In addition to tangible and intangible assets, such as those described earlier, it is also necessary to account for incremental additions to working capital (Add WC). For example, if a new project will require that the firm increase the amount of cash that it keeps on hand, this increase must be accounted for. If the product being produced is going to be sold on credit, thereby generating additional accounts receivable, the cost of providing that credit must also be accounted for. Similarly, if it will be necessary to hold product in inventory, the cost of financing that inventory must be considered. Finally, it is important to consider any incremental changes in current liabilities associated with the project.

The FCF Calculation: An Example
Let’s work a more comprehensive example to see how FCF is calculated in practice. Suppose that you work at an outdoor performing arts center and are evaluating a project to increase the number of seats by building four new box seating areas and adding 5,000 seats for the general public. Each box seating area is expected to generate $400,000 in incremental annual revenue, while each of the new seats for the general public will generate $2,500 in incremental annual revenue. The incremental expenses associated with the new boxes and seating will amount to 60 percent of the revenues. These expenses include hiring additional personnel to handle concessions, ushering, and security. The new construction will cost $10 million and will be fully depreciated (to a value of zero dollars) on a straight-line basis over the 10-year life of the project. The arts center will have to invest $1 million in additional working capital immediately, but the project will not require any other working capital investments during its life. This working capital will be recovered in the last year of the project. The center’s marginal tax rate is 30 percent. What are the incremental cash flows from this project?

EXHIBIT 11.2 FCF Calculation Worksheet for the Performing Arts Center Project

A free cash flow (FCF) calculation table is useful in evaluating a project. It helps organize the calculations and ensure that they are completed correctly.

 	Year 0	Years 1 to 9	Year 10
Revenue		
_______	_______	_______
_______	_______	_______
_______	_______	_______
_______	_______	_______
−Cap Exp		
_______	_______	_______
When evaluating a project, it is generally helpful to first organize your calculations by setting up a worksheet such as the one illustrated in Exhibit 11.2. A worksheet like this helps ensure that the calculations are completed correctly. The left-hand column in Exhibit 11.2 shows the actual calculations that will be performed. Other columns are included for each of the years during the life of the project, from Year 0 (today) through the last year in the life of the project (Year 10). In this example the cash flows will be exactly the same for Years 1 through 9; therefore, for illustration purposes, we will only include a single column to represent these years. If you were using a spreadsheet, you would normally include one column for each year.

Unless there is information to the contrary, we can assume that the investment outlay for this project will be made today (Year 0). We do this because in a typical project, no revenue will be generated and no expenses will be incurred until after the investment has been made. Consequently, the only cash flows in Year 0 are those for new construction (Cap Exp = $10,000,000) and additional working capital (Add WC = $1,000,000). The FCF in Year 0 will therefore equal −$11,000,000.

In Years 1 through 9, incremental revenue (Revenue) will equal:

Incremental Op Ex will equal 0.60 × $14,100,000 = $8,460,000. Finally, depreciation (there is no amortization in this example) is computed as:

Note that only the Cap Exp are depreciated and that these capital expenditures will be completely depreciated or written off over the 10-year life of the project because no salvage value is anticipated. Working capital is not depreciated because it will be recovered at the end of the project as the project’s inventory is sold off, receivables are collected, and short-term liabilities are repaid.

The cash flows in Year 10 will be the same as those in Years 1 through 9 except that the $1 million invested in additional working capital will be recovered in the last year. The $1 million is added back to (or a negative number is subtracted from) the incremental cash flows from operations in the calculation of the Year 10 cash flows.

EXHIBIT 11.3 Completed FCF Calculation Worksheet for the Performing Arts Center Project

The completed calculation table shows how the incremental after-tax free cash flows (FCF) for the performing arts center project are computed, along with the NPV for that project when the cost of capital is 10 percent.

 	Year 0	Years 1 to 9	Year 10
Revenue		  $14,100,000	  $14,100,000

__________		
−Cap Exp	    $10,000,000	                      0	                      0
NPV @ 10%	   $15,487,664		
The completed cash flow calculation worksheet for this example is presented in Exhibit 11.3. We could have completed the calculations without the worksheet. However, as mentioned, a cash flow calculation worksheet is a useful tool because it helps us make sure we don’t forget anything. Once we have set up the worksheet, calculating the incremental cash flows is simply a matter of filling in the blanks. As you will see in the following discussion, correctly filling in some blanks can be difficult at times, but the worksheet keeps us organized by reminding us which blanks have yet to be filled in.

Notice that with a discount rate of 10 percent, the NPV of the cash flows in Exhibit 11.3 is $15,487,664. As in Chapter 10, the NPV is obtained by calculating the present values of all of the cash flows and adding them up. You might confirm this by doing this calculation yourself. The Using Excel Example on the next page illustrates the setup for the performing arts center project analysis in Excel.

FCF versus Accounting Earnings
It is worth stressing again that the FCF we have been discussing in this section is what matters to investors. The impact of a project on a firm’s overall value or on its stock price does not depend on how the project affects the company’s accounting earnings. It depends only on how the project affects the company’s free cash flows.

Recall that accounting earnings can differ from cash flows for a number of reasons, making accounting earnings an unreliable measure of the costs and benefits of a project. For example, as soon as a firm sells a good or provides a service, its income statement will reflect the associated revenue and expenses, regardless of whether the customer has paid cash.

Accounting earnings also reflect noncash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, which are intended to account for the costs associated with deterioration of the assets in a business as those assets are used. Depreciation and amortization rules can cause substantial differences between cash flows and reported income because the assets acquired for a project are generally depreciated over several years, even though the actual cash outflow for their acquisition typically takes place at the beginning of the project.

Decision Making Example 11.1 illustrates how expected free cash flows can affect an investment decision.

Using Excel
Performing Arts Center Project

Cash flow calculations for capital budgeting problems are best set up and solved using a spreadsheet. Here is the setup for the performing arts center project:


The following is the formula setup for the performing arts center project. As we did in Exhibit 11.3, we have combined Years 1 through 9 in a single column to save space. As mentioned in previous chapters, notice that none of the values in the actual worksheet are hard coded but instead use references from the key assumptions list, or specific formulas. This allows for an easy analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions.


DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 11.1
Free Cash Flows

Situation

You have saved $6,000 and plan to use $5,500 to buy a motorcycle. However, just before you go to the motorcycle dealership, a friend asks you to invest your $6,000 in a local delivery business she is starting. Assuming she can raise the money, your friend has two alternatives regarding how to market the business. As illustrated below, both of these alternatives have an NPV of $2,614 with an opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. The business has a marginal tax rate of 25 percent. You will receive all free cash flows from the business until you have recovered your $6,000 plus 12 percent interest. After that, you and your friend will split any additional cash proceeds. If you decide to invest, which alternative would you prefer that your friend choose?

 	Alternative 1		Alternative 2

11.2 Estimating Cash Flows in Practice
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss the five general rules for incremental after-tax free cash flow calculations and explain why cash flows stated in nominal (real) dollars should be discounted using a nominal (real) discount rate.
Now that we have discussed what FCFs are and how they are calculated, we are ready to focus on some important issues that arise when we estimate FCFs in practice. The first of these issues is determining which cash flows are incremental to the project and which are not. In this section we begin with a discussion of five general rules that help us do this. We then discuss why it is important to distinguish between nominal and real cash flows. Next, we discuss some concepts regarding tax rates and depreciation that are crucial to the calculation of FCF in practice. Finally, we describe and illustrate several other issues that might affect the calculation of FCF for the final year of a project.

Five General Rules for Incremental After-Tax Free Cash Flow Calculations
As discussed earlier, we must determine how a project would change the after-tax free cash flows of the firm in order to calculate its NPV. This is not always simple to do, especially in a large firm that has a complex accounting system and many other projects that are not independent of the project being considered. Fortunately, there are five rules that can help us isolate the FCFs specific to an individual project even under the most complicated circumstances.

Rule 1: Include cash flows and only cash flows in your calculations. Do not include allocated costs unless they reflect cash flows. Examples of allocated costs are charges that accountants allocate to individual businesses to reflect their share of the corporate overhead (the costs associated with the senior managers of the firm, centralized accounting and finance functions, and so forth).
To see how allocated costs can differ from actual costs (and cash flows), consider a firm with $3 million of annual corporate overhead expenses and two identical manufacturing plants. Each of these plants would typically be allocated one-half, or $1.5 million, of the corporate overhead when their accounting profitability is estimated.
Suppose now that the firm is considering building a third plant that would be identical to the other two. If this plant is built, it will have no impact on the annual corporate overhead cash expense. Someone in accounting might argue that the new plant should be able to support its “fair share” of the $3 million overhead, or $1 million, and that this overhead should be included in the cash flow calculation. Of course, this person would be wrong. Since total corporate overhead costs will not change if the third plant is built, no overhead should be included when calculating the incremental FCFs for this plant.
Rule 2: Include the impact of the project on cash flows from other product lines. If the product associated with a project is expected to affect sales of one or more other products at the firm, you must include the expected impact of the new project on the cash flows from the other products when computing the FCFs. For example, consider the analysis that managers at Apple Inc. would have done before giving the go-ahead for the development of the iPhone. Since, like iPods, the iPhone can store music, these analysts might have expected that the introduction of the iPhone would reduce annual iPod sales. If so, they would have had to account for the reduction in cash flows from lost iPod sales when they forecast the FCFs for the iPhone.
Similarly, if a new product is expected to boost sales of another, complementary, product, then the increase in cash flows associated with the new sales from that complementary product line should also be reflected in the FCFs. For example, consider how the introduction of the Apple iPad might affect music and video downloads from Apple iTunes. Many of the people who purchase an iPad and who have not previously downloaded songs and other content from iTunes will begin to do so. The cash flows from downloads by these new users are not directly tied to iPad sales, but they are incremental to those sales. If Apple had not introduced the iPad device, it would not have these iTunes sales. The analysis of the iPad project should have included the estimated impact of that project on cash flows from iTunes.
Rule 3: Include all opportunity costs. By opportunity costs, we mean the cost of giving up the next best opportunity.1 Opportunity costs can arise in many different ways. For example, a project may require the use of a building or a piece of equipment that could otherwise be sold or leased to someone else. To the extent that selling or leasing the building or piece of equipment would generate additional cash flow for the firm and the opportunity to realize that cash flow must be forgone if the project is adopted, thus it represents an opportunity cost.
To see why this is so, suppose that a project will require the use of a piece of equipment that the firm already has and that can be sold for $50,000 on the used-equipment market. If the project is accepted, the firm will lose the opportunity to sell the piece of equipment for $50,000. This is a $50,000 cost that must be included in the project analysis. Accepting the project reduces the amount of money that the firm can realize from selling excess equipment by this amount.
Rule 4: Forget sunk costs. Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred. All that matters when you evaluate a project at a particular point in time is how much you have to invest in the future and what you can expect to receive in return for that investment. Past investments are irrelevant.
To see this, consider the situation in which your company has invested $10 million in a project that has not yet generated any cash inflows. Also assume that circumstances have changed so the project, which was originally expected to generate cash inflows with a present value of $20 million, is now expected to generate cash inflows with a value of only $2 million. To receive this $2 million, however, your company will have to invest another $1 million. Should your firm do it? Of course it should!
The sunk cost for this investment is $10 million. That money has been spent and is therefore not relevant for the decision of whether to invest $1 million now. Since the $1 million of new spending generates new cash flows worth $2 million, this is a project with a positive NPV of $1 million and it should be accepted. Another way to think about it is that if your company stops investing now, it will have lost $10 million. If it makes the investment, its total loss will be $9 million. Although neither is an attractive alternative, it should be clear that it is better to lose $9 million than it is to lose $10 million. The point here is that, while it is often painful to do, you should ignore sunk costs when computing project FCFs.
Rule 5: Include only after-tax cash flows in the cash flow calculations. The incremental pretax earnings of a project matter only to the extent that they affect the after-tax cash flows that the firm’s investors receive. For an individual project, as mentioned earlier, we compute the after-tax cash flows using the firm’s marginal tax rate because this is the rate that will be applied against the incremental cash flows generated by the project.
Let’s use the performing arts center project to illustrate how these rules are applied in practice. Suppose the following requirements and costs are associated with this project:

The chief financial officer requires that each project be assessed 5 percent of the initial investment to account for costs associated with the accounting, marketing, and information technology departments.
It is very likely that increasing the number of seats will reduce revenues next door at the cinema that your employer also owns. Attendance at the cinema is expected to be lower only when the performing arts center is staging a big event. The total impact is expected to be a reduction of $500,000 each year, before taxes, in the operating profits (EBIT) of the cinema. The depreciation of the cinema’s assets will not be affected.
If the project is adopted, the new seating will be built in an area where exhibits have been placed in the past when the center has hosted guest lectures by well-known painters or sculptors. The performing arts center will no longer be able to host such events, and revenue will be reduced by $600,000 each year as a result.
The center has already spent $400,000 researching demand for new seating.
You have just discovered that a new salesperson will be hired if the center goes ahead with the expansion. This person will be responsible for sales and service of the four new luxury boxes and will be paid $75,000 per year, including salary and benefits. The $75,000 is not included in the 60 percent figure for operating expenses that was previously mentioned.

What impact will these requirements and costs have on the FCFs for the project? Exhibit 11.4 shows their impact on the FCFs and NPV presented in Exhibit 11.3.

The 5 percent assessment sounds like an allocated overhead cost. To the extent that this assessment does not reflect an actual increase in cash costs, it should not be included. It is not relevant to the project. The analysis should include only incremental cash flows.
The impact of the expansion on the operating profits of the cinema is an example of how a project can erode or cannibalize business in another part of a firm. The $500,000 reduction in EBIT is relevant and should be included in the analysis.
The loss of the ability to use the exhibits area, the next best alternative to the new seating plan, represents a $600,000 opportunity cost. The center is giving up revenue from guest lecturers that require exhibit space in order to build the additional seating. This opportunity cost will be partially offset by elimination of the operating expenses associated with the guest lectures.
The $400,000 for research has already been spent. The decision of whether to accept or reject the project will not alter the amount spent for this research. This is a sunk cost that should not be included in the analysis.
The $75,000 annual salary for the new salesperson is an incremental cost that should be included in the analysis. Even though the marketing department is a corporate overhead department, in this case the salesperson must be hired specifically because of the new project.
The specific changes in the analysis from Exhibits 11.3 to 11.4 are as follows. Revenue and Op Ex after Year 0 have been reduced from $14,100,000 and $8,460,000, respectively, in Exhibit 11.3 to $13,500,000 and $8,100,000, respectively, in Exhibit 11.4. These changes reflect the $600,000 loss of revenues and the reduction in costs (60 percent of revenue) associated with the loss of the ability to host guest lectures. The $75,000 expense for the new salesperson’s salary and the $500,000 reduction in the EBIT of the cinema are then subtracted from Revenue, along with Op Ex. These changes result in EBITDA of $4,825,000 in Exhibit 11.4, compared with EBITDA of $5,640,000 in Exhibit 11.3. The net result is a reduction in the project NPV from $15,487,664 (in Exhibit 11.3) to $11,982,189 (in Exhibit 11.4).

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 11.1
Using the General Rules for FCF Calculations

Problem

You have owned and operated a pizza parlor for several years. The space that you lease for your pizza parlor is considerably larger than the space you need. To more efficiently utilize this space, you are considering subdividing it and opening a hamburger stand. You know that your analysis should consider the overall impact of the hamburger project on the total cash flows of your business, but beyond estimating revenues and costs from hamburger-related sales and the investment required to get the hamburger business started, you are unsure what else you should consider. Based on the five general rules for incremental after-tax cash flow calculations, what other factors should you consider?





Learning by Doing Application 11.1 provides more insights regarding application of the five rules for incremental after-tax free cash flow calculations.

Nominal versus Real Cash Flows
In addition to following the five rules for incremental after-tax cash flow calculations, it is very important to make sure that all cash flows are stated in either nominal dollars or real dollars—not a mixture of the two. The concepts of nominal and real dollars are directly related to the discussion in Chapter 2 that distinguishes between (1) the nominal rate of interest and (2) the real rate of interest. Nominal dollars are the dollars that we typically think of. They represent the actual dollar amounts that we expect a project to generate in the future, without any adjustments. To the extent that there is inflation, the purchasing power of each nominal dollar will decline over time. When prices are going up, a given nominal dollar amount will buy less and less over time. Real dollars represent dollars stated in terms of constant purchasing power. When we forecast in real dollars, the purchasing power of the dollars in one period is equal to the purchasing power of the dollars in any other period.

nominal dollars dollar amounts that are not adjusted for inflation; the purchasing power of a nominal dollar amount depends on when that amount is received

real dollars inflation-adjusted dollars; the actual purchasing power of dollars stated in real terms is the same regardless of when those dollars are received

To illustrate the difference between nominal and real dollars, let’s consider an example. Suppose that the rate of inflation is expected to be 5 percent next year and that you just lent $100 to a friend for one year. If your friend is not paying any interest, the nominal dollar amount you expect to receive in one year is $100. At that time, though, the purchasing power of this $100 is expected to be only $95.24: $100/(1 + ΔPe) = $100/1.05 = $95.24, where ΔPe is the expected rate of inflation as discussed in Chapter 2. In other words, if inflation is as expected, when your friend repays the $100, it will buy only what $95.24 would buy today. You will have earned a real return of ($95.24 − $100)/$100 = −0.0476, or −4.76 percent, on this loan. Another way of thinking about this loan is that your friend is expected to repay you with dollars having a real value of only $95.24.

To understand the importance of making sure that all cash flows are stated in either nominal dollars or real dollars, it is useful to write the cost of capital (k) from Chapter 10 as:

(11.3)
In Equation 11.3, k is the nominal cost of capital that is normally used to discount cash flows and r is the real cost of capital.2 This equation tells us that the nominal cost of capital equals the real cost of capital, adjusted for the expected rate of inflation. This means that whenever we discount a cash flow using the nominal cost of capital, the discount rate we are using reflects both the expected rate of inflation (ΔPe) and a real return (r). If, on the one hand, we discounted a real cash flow using the nominal cost of capital, we would be overcompensating for expected inflation in the discounting process. On the other hand, if we discounted a nominal cash flow using the real cost of capital (r), we would be undercompensating for expected inflation.

In capital budgeting, we normally forecast cash flows in nominal dollars and discount them using the nominal cost of capital.3 As an alternative, we can state the cash flows in real terms and discount them using the real cost of capital. This alternative calculation will give us exactly the same NPV. To see this, consider a project that will require an investment of $50,000 in Year 0 and will produce FCFs of $20,000 a year in Years 1 through 4. With a 15 percent nominal cost of capital, the NPV for this project is:

Equation 11.3 can be used to calculate the real cost of capital if we recognize that it can be rearranged algebraically as:

With a 5 percent expected rate of inflation, the real cost of capital is therefore:

Discounting the nominal cash flows by the rate of inflation tells us that the real cash flows are:

Year 0	Year 1	Year 2	Year 3	Year 4
−$50,000	$20,000	$20,000	$20,000	$20,000
 	1 + 0.05	(1 + 0.05)2	(1 + 0.05)3	(1 + 0.05)4
= −$50,000	= $19,048	= $18,141	= $17,277	= $16,454
Therefore, when we discount the real cash flows using the real cost of capital, we see that the NPV is:

Notice that the present value of each of the annual cash flows is exactly the same when we use nominal cash flows and when we use real cash flows. This has to be the case because when we stated the NPV calculation in real dollars, we first divided the discount rate by 1.05. We then reduced the value of the future cash flows by discounting them by 5 percent. This is equivalent to reducing the numerator and the denominator in each present value calculation by the same fraction, which must result in the same answer.

Learning by Doing Application 11.2 illustrates how nominal and real rates of return can be compared when evaluating investment opportunities.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 11.2
The Investment Decision and Nominal versus Real Dollars

Problem

You are trying to decide how to invest $25,000, which you just inherited from a distant relative. You do not want to take any risks with this money because you want to use it as a down payment on a home when you graduate in three years. Therefore, you have decided to invest the money in securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. government. You are considering two alternatives: a three-year Treasury note and an inflation-indexed Treasury security. If you invest in the three-year Treasury note, you will be paid 3 percent per year in interest and will get your $25,000 back at the end of three years. If you invest in the inflation-indexed security, you will be paid 1 percent per year plus an amount that reflects actual inflation in each of the next three years. For example, if inflation equals 2 percent per year for each of the next three years, you will receive 3 percent each year in total interest. This interest on the inflation-indexed security will compound, and you will receive a single payment at the end of three years. If you expect inflation to average 2.5 percent per year over the next three years, should you invest in the three-year Treasury note or in the inflation-indexed Treasury security?





Tax Rates and Depreciation
The United States has a very complicated corporate tax system. Corporations pay taxes at the federal, state, and local levels. Some governmental jurisdictions tax income, while others tax property or some other measure of value. Furthermore, a wide variety of deductions and adjustments are made to income or other measures of value when computing the actual taxes that a corporation owes. A detailed discussion of the different taxes that corporations pay and how they are computed is beyond the scope of this text. However, at this point, it is important for you to be familiar with the tax system that we have in the United States and with the depreciation methods used for computing corporate tax obligations. These concepts are especially important in capital budgeting.

Marginal and Average Tax Rates

As we saw in Chapter 3, the average tax rate is the total taxes paid divided by taxable income. In contrast, the marginal tax rate is the tax rate that is paid on the last dollar of income earned. When you are making investment decisions, the relevant tax rate to use is usually the marginal tax rate. The reason is that new investments (projects) are expected to generate new cash flows, which will be taxed at the business’s marginal tax rate. As a result, it is important to consider any difference between the average tax rate and the marginal tax rate in financial decision making.

The 2021 federal tax rate for C-Corps is a flat 21 percent. This means that for federal taxes the marginal and average rates are a constant 21 percent. Some states, however, have a progressive tax system, under which companies pay a progressively larger share of their income in state taxes as their income rises. This happens in a progressive tax system because the marginal tax rate at low levels of income is lower than the marginal tax rate at high levels of income. The result is that many companies face “blended” state and federal tax rates that are progressive, and exceed the 21 percent federal rate.

Learning by Doing Application 11.3 illustrates calculation of marginal and average tax rates.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 11.3
Calculating Marginal and Average Tax Rates

Problem

Assume that you are operating the pizza parlor and hamburger stand described in Learning by Doing Application 11.1. Because the business has become complicated, you have incorporated. From now on, earnings are subject to a flat federal corporate tax rate of 21 percent. You also have to pay state corporate tax at a rate of 7.5 percent on taxable income up to $50,000 and at 9 percent on taxable income above $50,000.

If your corporation’s total taxable income is $200,000 in 2020, how much does it owe in federal and state taxes? What are the corporation’s marginal and average “blended” federal and state tax rates? If you were considering buying a new oven, which tax rate would you use when computing the free cash flows?





Taxes and Depreciation

Corporations keep two sets of books. One set is kept for preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These are the financial statements that appear in the annual report and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The other set is kept for computing the taxes that the corporation actually pays. Corporations must keep two sets of books because the GAAP rules for computing income are different from the rules that the IRS uses.

One especially important difference from a capital budgeting perspective is that the depreciation methods allowed by GAAP differ from those allowed by the IRS. The straight-line depreciation method illustrated earlier in this chapter in the performing arts center example is allowed by GAAP and is often used for financial reporting. In contrast, an “accelerated” method of depreciation, called the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), has been in use for U.S. federal tax calculations since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 went into effect.4 MACRS is an accelerated system in the sense that depreciation charges for all assets other than nonfarm real property (for example, buildings) are higher in the early years of an asset’s life than with the straight-line method. MACRS thus enables a firm to deduct depreciation charges sooner, thereby realizing the tax savings sooner and increasing the present value of the tax savings. Since we want to estimate the actual incremental cash flows from a project in capital budgeting, we use the depreciation method allowed by the IRS in our calculations. This is the method that determines how much of a tax deduction a corporation actually receives for an investment.

Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) the accelerated depreciation method that has been in use for U.S. federal taxes since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 went into effect

Exhibit 11.5 lists the percentage of the cost of an asset that can be depreciated in each year for assets with 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year allowable recovery periods. The recovery periods for specific types of assets are specified in the tax law that is passed by Congress and signed by the president. For instance, in 2020, the allowable recovery period was 5 years for computers and automobiles, 7 years for office furniture, 10 years for water transportation equipment such as barges, 15 years for railroad wharves and docks, 20 years for farm buildings, 27.5 years for residential rental property, and 39 years for nonresidential real property (such as manufacturing buildings). Residential rental and nonresidential real property are depreciated using the straight-line method. Depreciation charges are intended to represent the cost of wear and tear on assets in the course of business. However, since they are set through a political process, they may be greater than or less than the actual cost of this wear and tear.

EXHIBIT 11.5 MACRS Depreciation Schedules by Allowable Recovery Period

The MACRS schedule lists the tax depreciation rates that firms use for assets placed into service after the Tax Reform Act of 1986 went into effect. The table indicates the percentage of the cost of the asset that can be depreciated in each year during the period that it is being used. Year 1 is the year in which the asset is first placed into service.

Year	3-Year	5-Year	7-Year	10-Year	15-Year	20-Year
  1	    33.33%	    20.00%	    14.29%	    10.00%	    5.00%	    3.75%

Total	100.00%	100.00%	100.00%	100.00%	100.00%	100.00%
Note that the percentages in each column of Exhibit 11.5 add up to 100 percent. This is because the tax law allows firms to depreciate 100 percent of the cost of an asset regardless of the expected salvage value of that asset. Consequently, when we use the MACRS schedule to determine the tax depreciation, we do not have to worry about the expected salvage value for the asset.5

Let’s consider an example to show how MACRS is applied. Suppose you are evaluating a project that will require the purchase of an automobile for $25,000. Since an automobile is a five-year asset under MACRS, you can use the percentages for a five-year asset in Exhibit 11.5 to calculate the annual depreciation deductions:

Notice that even though the automobile is a five-year asset, there is a depreciation charge in the sixth year. This is because MACRS assumes that the asset is placed in service in the middle of the first year. As a result, the firm is allowed a deduction for half of a year in Year 1, a full year in Years 2 through 5, and half of a year in Year 6.

Recall that the FCF calculation, Equation 11.1, included incremental depreciation along with incremental amortization (D&A). We put depreciation and amortization together in the calculation because amortization is a noncash charge (deduction) like depreciation. It is beyond the scope of this book to discuss amortization in detail because the rules that govern it are complex. However, you should know that, as was discussed in Chapter 3, amortization, like depreciation, is a deduction that is allowed under the tax law to compensate for the decline in value of certain, mainly intangible, assets used by a business.

Computing the Terminal-Year FCF
The FCF in the last, or terminal, year of a project’s life often includes cash flows that are not typically included in the calculations for other years. For instance, in the final year of a project, the assets acquired during the life of the project may be sold and the working capital that has been invested may be recovered. The cash flows that result from the sale of assets and recovery of working capital must be included in the calculation of the terminal-year FCF.

You can see this in the performing arts center example discussed earlier. Note that the Year 10, or terminal year, cash flows in this example are different from those in the other years. They include investment cash flows that reflect the recovery of net working capital investments. Net incremental additions to working capital (Add WC) that are due to the project are calculated as follows:

(11.4)
where the changes in cash and cash equivalents (marketable securities), accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable represent changes in the values of these accounts that result from the adoption of the project.

Looking at the components of Add WC, we can see that cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and inventories require the investment of capital, while accounts payable represent capital provided by suppliers. When a project ends, the cash and cash equivalents are no longer needed, the accounts receivable are collected, the inventories are sold, and the accounts payable are paid. In other words, the firm recovers the net working capital that has been invested in the project. To reflect this in the FCF calculation, the cash flow in the last year of the project typically includes a negative investment in working capital that equals the cumulative investment in working capital over the life of the project. It is very important to make sure that the recovery of working capital is reflected in the cash flows in the last year of a project. In some businesses, working capital can account for 20 percent or more of revenue, and excluding working capital recovery from the calculations can cause you to substantially understate the NPV of a project.

In some projects, there will also be incremental capital expenditures (Cap Exp) in the terminal year. This is because, for example, the assets acquired for the project are being sold or there are disposal costs associated with them. In the performing arts center example, Cap Exp is $0 in Year 10. This is because we were assuming that, other than the working capital, the investments at the beginning of the project would have no salvage value, there would be no disposal costs associated with the assets, and there would be no clean-up costs associated with the project in Year 10. When an asset is expected to have a salvage value, we must include the salvage value realized from the sale of the asset and the impact of the sale on the firm’s taxes in the terminal-year FCF calculations. Any costs that must be incurred to dispose of assets should also be included. Finally, clean-up costs, such as those associated with restoring the environment after a project, also must be included in the terminal-year FCF.

The salvage value realized from the sale of the assets used in a project includes both the cash that is actually realized when they are sold and, if the salvage value of any asset differs from its depreciated book value, the tax implications from the sale. To better understand how taxes affect the terminal-year cash flows for a project, let’s make the performing arts center example more realistic. Recall that the initial Cap Exp in the performing arts center example was $10 million, that we used straight-line depreciation, and that we assumed that the salvage value would be $0 in Year 10. Now that we know about MACRS, let’s more realistically assume that the allowable recovery period for this investment under MACRS is 10 years.

Exhibit 11.6 presents the depreciation calculations for this investment under MACRS. Note that since the amount of depreciation now changes over time, we can no longer present Years 1 through 9 together as we did in Exhibit 11.3. Also note that because MACRS allows only a half year of depreciation in Year 1, the book value of the investment is greater than $0 at the end of Year 10. In this case it is $328,000.

If we still assume a salvage value of $0 for this investment, the fact that the book value is positive means that the firm will have a tax loss when it writes off the remaining value of the investment at the end of the project. In other words, when the project ends, the firm will take a deduction when computing its taxes that equals the remaining $328,000 book value of the asset. With a 30 percent tax rate, this will result in a tax savings of $328,000 × 0.30 = $98,400. This tax savings must be reflected in the cash flow calculations in Year 10. Exhibit 11.7 illustrates the cash flow and NPV calculations for the performing arts center example with these changes. The $98,400 tax savings is included as a negative capital expenditure in Year 10 (as −98 since we are rounding to thousands).6 Notice that the NPV has increased from $15,487,664 in Exhibit 11.3 to $15,610,135. The $122,471 difference reflects the present value of the tax savings from using MACRS depreciation instead of straight-line depreciation plus the tax savings from the disposal of the asset.

EXHIBIT 11.7 FCF Calculations and NPV for Performing Arts Center Project with MACRS Depreciation ($ thousands)

This exhibit shows the FCF calculations and the NPV for the performing arts center project when MACRS is used to compute depreciation. These calculations correspond to those in Exhibit 11.3, which reflect straight-line depreciation. Notice that the NPV is greater with the MACRS system because the tax shields from the depreciation are realized sooner.

If the salvage value is greater than $0 but less than the book value of $328,000, the tax savings will be smaller than $98,400, and if the salvage value exceeds the book value, the firm will actually have a gain on the sale of the asset that will increase its tax liability. In either of these cases, you must include the proceeds from the sale of the assets and the tax effects in your cash flow calculations.

The general formula for calculating the tax on the salvage value for an asset is:

where t is the firm’s marginal tax rate.

To make sure we know how we use this equation, suppose that the salvage value (selling price) in Year 10 of the $10,000,000 investment in the performing arts center project is expected to be $1,000,000 and that the book value remains $328,000. In this case the firm will pay additional taxes of ($1,000,000 − $328,000) × 0.30 = $201,600 on the sale of the assets. Deducting this amount from the $1,000,000 that the firm receives from the sale of the assets yields after-tax proceeds of $798,400 and the cash flows illustrated in Exhibit 11.8. This $798,400 is greater than the $98,000 in Exhibit 11.7 and therefore the NPV for the project is greater.

Learning by Doing Application 11.4 illustrates calculation of the after-tax proceeds from the sale of an asset.

Accounting for Taxes When Assets Are Sold

Problem

You have decided to replace an oven in your pizza parlor. The old oven originally cost $20,000. Depreciation charges of $15,000 have been taken since you acquired it, resulting in a current book value of $5,000. The owner of a restaurant down the street has offered you $3,000 for the old oven. If you accept this offer, how will the sale affect the cash flows from your business? Assume the marginal tax rate for your business is 23 percent.





Expected Cash Flows
It is very important to realize that in an NPV analysis we use the expected FCF for each year of the life of the project. Similar to the expected values calculated in Chapter 7, the expected FCF for a particular year equals the sum of the products of the possible outcomes (FCFs) and the probabilities that those outcomes will be realized.

Building Intuition
We Discount Expected Cash Flows in an NPV Analysis

Not only are the FCFs that we discount forward looking, but they also reflect expected FCFs. Each FCF is a weighted average of the cash flows from each possible future outcome, where the cash flow from each outcome is weighted by the estimated probability that the outcome will be realized. The expected FCF represents the single best estimate of what the actual FCF will be.

To better illustrate this point, suppose that you have just invented a new board game and are trying to decide whether you should produce and sell it. If you decide to go ahead with this project, you estimate that it will cost you $100,000 for the equipment necessary to produce and distribute the game. Also, you think there are three possible outcomes if you make this investment—game sales are excellent, game sales are good, and game sales are poor—and that the probabilities associated with these outcomes are 25 percent, 50 percent, and 25 percent, respectively. If the FCFs under each of these three outcomes are as illustrated in Exhibit 11.9, then the expected FCF values that you would discount in your NPV analysis are −$100.00, $48.75, $53.75, and $35.00 for years 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.7 You should confirm that each of these values is correct to make sure that you understand how to calculate an expected FCF.

With these FCF estimates, we can now calculate the NPV of the board game project. For instance, if your cost of capital is 10 percent, the NPV is:

Since the project has a positive NPV, you should accept it.

We use expected FCFs in an NPV analysis because uncertainties regarding project cash flows that are unique to the project should be reflected in the cash flow forecasts. In Chapter 13 we will discuss why analysts who try to account for such uncertainties by adjusting the discount rate, rather than the cash flows, are wrong.

11.3 Forecasting Free Cash Flows
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe how distinguishing between variable and fixed costs can be useful in forecasting operating expenses.
Earlier, we discussed how to calculate the incremental free cash flows (FCFs) for a project. Of course, when we evaluate a project, we do not know exactly what the cash flows will be, and so we must forecast them. As the performing arts center example suggests, analysts do this for each line item in the FCF calculation for each year during the life of a project. We are now ready to discuss how these forecasts are prepared.

Cash Flows from Operations
To forecast the incremental cash flows from operations (CF Opns) for a project, we must forecast the incremental net revenue (Revenue), operating expenses (Op Ex), and depreciation and amortization (D&A) associated with the project, as well as the firm’s marginal tax rate. To forecast Revenue, analysts typically estimate the number of units that will be sold and the per-unit sales price for each year during the life of the project. The product of the number of units sold and the per-unit sales price equals the Revenue (assuming that the project does not affect other product lines). Separating the Revenue forecast into incremental unit sales and price forces the analyst to think clearly about how well the project has to perform in terms of actual unit sales in order to achieve the forecasted Revenue.

When forecasting Op Ex, analysts often distinguish between variable costs, which vary directly with unit sales, and fixed costs, which do not. To illustrate the difference, consider a situation in which the managers of a firm plan to introduce a video game console that uses virtual reality technology. An overseas design and manufacturing company will produce the components and ship them to the company, which will assemble, package, and ship the finished product. The main variable costs will be those associated with purchasing the components; the labor required for assembling the players; packaging materials; shipping; and perhaps sales and marketing. These variable costs will rise in direct proportion to the number of units produced. If the number of units doubles, for example, we would expect these costs to approximately double. Fixed costs, such as the costs associated with assembly space (assuming output can be increased by adding shifts rather than obtaining additional space) and administrative expenses, will not increase directly with the number of units sold.8

variable costs costs that vary directly with the number of units sold

fixed costs costs that do not vary directly with the number of units sold

Distinguishing between variable and fixed costs simplifies the forecasting problem. If company analysts estimate Revenue for a project from unit sales and price forecasts, as described earlier, then the analysts can forecast variable costs by multiplying the variable cost per unit by the number of units expected to be sold each year. Fixed cost forecasts, in contrast, will not typically vary as closely with unit sales. They tend to be based on explicit estimations of the cost of manufacturing (assembly) space, salaries and number of people required for administration of the project, and so forth.

Since D&A is determined by the amounts invested in depreciable assets and the lives over which these assets can be depreciated, this line item in the CF Opns calculation is computed based on the incremental capital expenditures (Cap Exp) associated with the project, the allowable recovery period, and the depreciation method used. Consequently, it is very important to carefully think through the size and timing of the Cap Exp and the nature of those assets to properly estimate the D&A deductions.

As discussed earlier, the tax rate that should be used when forecasting CF Opns is the marginal rate the firm expects to pay on the incremental cash flows generated by the project in the future. Past tax rates are relevant only to the extent that they tell us something about future tax rates. Federal, state, and local officials can change tax rates in the future, and to the extent that such changes can be predicted, they should be reflected in the cash flow forecasts. Unfortunately, such changes are difficult to predict. As a result, analysts normally use the firm’s current marginal tax rate.

Cash Flows Associated with Capital Expenditures and Net Working Capital
As discussed earlier, we must consider two general classes of investments when calculating FCF: incremental capital expenditures (Cap Exp) and incremental additions to working capital (Add WC). Each presents its own special challenges in the preparation of forecasts. In this section, we consider several issues related to forecasting Cap Exp and Add WC.

Capital Expenditures

Cap Exp forecasts in an NPV analysis reflect the expected level of investment during each year of the project’s life, including any inflows from salvage values and any tax costs or benefits associated with asset sales. As illustrated in the performing arts center example, capital expenditures are typically required at the beginning of a project. Many projects require an initial investment for the assets necessary to produce a product and then little or no investment until the end of the project, when the assets are sold for their salvage value.

Some projects, however, require substantial periodic investments to replace or refurbish assets or to shut down operations (clean-up costs) at the end of the project’s life. For example, a chemical plant project might require a substantial investment every few years to refurbish worn equipment. In addition, environmental regulations are likely to require that the property on which a chemical plant is built be restored to its previous condition when it is dismantled. Investments such as these should be included in cash flow forecasts wherever appropriate.

Net Working Capital

As shown in Equation 11.4, cash flow forecasts in an NPV analysis include four working capital items: (1) cash and cash equivalents, (2) accounts receivable, (3) inventories, and (4) accounts payable.

Requirements for cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable are typically forecast as constant percentages of revenue. The cash and cash-equivalent requirements represent the amount of cash needed to make timely payments to suppliers and employees, as well as for other ongoing expenses. This amount tends to vary with the nature of the project, but analysts can gain insights into the required level of cash, as a percentage of revenue, by examining the cash-to-revenue ratios for companies that operate comparable businesses. For example, if you are forecasting cash flows for a hotel project, you might look at the ratio of cash to revenue at public companies that are focused on the hotel business for an indication of how much cash is required per dollar of revenue.

Forecasting accounts receivable is relatively straightforward. If customers will be given 30 days to pay for purchases and, on average, are expected to take 30 days to pay, the average accounts receivable balance will equal 30 days’ worth of revenue or 30 days/365 days per year = 0.0822, or 8.22 percent of annual revenue. This represents the amount of money that must be set aside to finance purchases by customers. For example, a company with $100 million in annual revenue can expect to have $8.22 million invested in accounts receivable at any point in time if its customers take an average of 30 days to pay for their purchases.

Inventories and accounts payable are generally forecast as a percentage of the cost of goods sold. Inventories are forecast this way because the cost of goods sold represents a measure of the amount of money actually invested in inventories. Accounts payable are forecast this way because the cost of goods sold is a measure of the amount of money actually owed to suppliers.

11.4 Special Cases
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the concept of equivalent annual cost and use it to compare projects with unequal lives, decide when to replace an existing asset, and calculate the opportunity cost of using an existing asset.
Now that we have discussed the fundamental concepts underlying NPV analysis (in Chapter 10) and how cash flows are calculated (in this chapter), we can turn our attention to some special cases that arise in capital budgeting. As you will see, dealing with these special cases generally involves the application of concepts that we have already discussed, along with a dose of common sense.

Projects with Different Lives
One problem that arises quite often in capital budgeting involves choosing between two mutually exclusive investments. Recall from Chapter 10 that if investments are mutually exclusive, the manager can choose one investment or the other, but not both. This choice is simple if the expected lives of the two investments are the same. We choose the investment with the larger NPV. This type of problem was illustrated in Chapter 10.

The analysis becomes more complicated, however, if the investments have different lives. For example, suppose that you run a lawn-mowing service and have to replace one of your mowers. Further suppose that you have two options: mower A, which costs $250 and is expected to last two years, and mower B, which costs $360 and is expected to last three years.

If the mowers are identical in every other way and you expect to be in the mowing business for a long time (in other words, you are going to continue to replace mowers as they wear out for the foreseeable future), then you cannot decide which mower to buy simply by comparing the $250 cost of mower A with the $360 cost of mower B. Mower A will provide two years of service, while mower B will provide three years of service.9

You might be tempted to choose the mower with the lower initial investment per year of service. For example, you might choose mower B because the initial investment is $120 per year of service ($360/3 years = $120 per year) while mower A requires an initial investment of $125 per year of service ($250/2 years = $125 per year). As you will see, however, this reasoning can get you into trouble.

In this situation, we can effectively make the lives of the mowers the same by assuming repeated investments over some identical period and comparing the NPVs of their costs. We can do this by considering a six-year investment period. We determine the six-year period by multiplying the life of mower A by the life of mower B (2 × 3 = 6). In six years you would buy mower A three times—in Years 0, 2, and 4—or mower B twice—in Years 0 and 3. If we assume that the cost of each mower will remain the same over the next six years, and if we use a 10 percent opportunity cost of capital, the NPVs of the costs of the two alternatives are:

Notice that mower A is actually cheaper over a six-year investment cycle. Over this period, it costs $627.36/6 = $104.56 per year in today’s dollars, while mower B costs $630.47/6 = $105.08 per year.

Often, a much more efficient way of solving a problem of this nature is to compute the equivalent annual cost (EAC). The EAC can be calculated as follows:

(11.5)
where k is the opportunity cost of capital, NPVi is the NPV of the investment i, and t is the life of the investment.

equivalent annual cost (EAC) the annual dollar amount of an annuity that has a life equal to that of a project and that also has a present value equal to the present value of the cash flows from the project; the term comes from the fact that the EAC calculation is often used to calculate a constant annual cost associated with projects in order to make comparisons

Using Equation 11.5, we find that the EACs for mowers A and B are:

and

We can see that the EAC gives us the same answer as equating the lives of the investments and calculating the NPVs over a six-year investment cycle. This is to be expected, since the EAC simply reflects the annuity that has the same present value as the cost of an investment over the investment period we are considering. For instance, the NPV of the EAC for mower A over a six-year period is

This is the same NPV we obtained earlier (allowing for rounding differences).

The problem is similar but a bit more complicated if the revenues or operating costs associated with the two mowers differ. For simplicity, let’s continue to assume that the mowers will generate the same revenue per year, but let’s also assume that mower A will cost $50 per year to maintain and mower B will cost $55 per year to maintain. The NPVs of the two mowers in this case are:

The EACs are:

and

Of course, we still want to choose mower A in this case since all that has really happened is that the EAC of mower A has gone up by $50 and the EAC of mower B has gone up by $55. In contrast, if the annual cost of maintaining mower A is $50 and the annual cost of maintaining mower B is $49, we would choose mower B. As confirmation, you should try the calculations for this example.

One other point should be made about the EAC concept. Despite its name, it does not apply only to costs. If we included revenues in the above analysis and both mowers had positive NPVs, we could still use the EAC formula to compare the two alternatives. The only difference in this case is that the decision criteria would be to choose the most positive EAC instead of the least negative.

Learning by Doing Application 11.5 illustrates another example of how EAC can be used to compare projects with different lives.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 11.5
Using EAC to Compare Projects with Different Lives

Problem

You are looking at new ovens for your pizza parlor, and you see two models that would work equally well. Model A would cost $40,000 and last 10 years. Model B would cost $50,000 but would last 12 years and would require $500 less electricity per year than model A. Which model is less expensive? Assume a 10 percent opportunity cost of capital.





When to Replace an Existing Asset
Occasionally, financial managers are asked to determine the appropriate time to replace an existing piece of equipment that is still operating. In these situations they must answer two fundamental questions: Do the benefits of replacing the existing machine exceed the costs, and if they do not now, when will they?

Let’s examine how these questions can be answered for a situation that commonly arises in the lawn-mowing business. Suppose you have an old mower that is working perfectly well, but you are considering upgrading to a faster model. The old mower will run for another three years before it has to be replaced and will generate cash inflows, net of costs, of $6,500 for each of the next three years. The new mower costs $2,000 and would bring in net cash flows of $7,000 for four years. When should you replace the old mower?

Solving this problem is simply a matter of computing the EAC for the new mower and comparing it with the annual cash inflows from the old mower. With a 10 percent opportunity cost of capital, the NPV of the new mower is:

Therefore, the EAC is:

In this example, the old mower should not be replaced until it wears out because it will generate net cash inflows of $6,500 for each of the next three years, while the EAC for the new mower is only $6,369.

Now suppose that, instead of remaining constant at $6,500, cash inflows from the old mower will decline from $6,500 in Year 1, to $6,000 in Year 2, and to $5,500 in Year 3 as maintenance expenditures and downtime increase near the end of the old mower’s useful life. As the EAC for the new mower is $6,369, the old machine should be replaced after the first year.

Decision Making Example 11.2 illustrates another example of how EAC can be used to decide when to replace an asset.

The Cost of Using an Existing Asset
In Section 11.2 we discussed five general rules for calculating the incremental after-tax free cash flows associated with a project. The third rule is to include all opportunity costs. Unfortunately, opportunity costs are not always directly observable. Sometimes they have to be computed. This is particularly true when the opportunity cost relates to the use of excess capacity associated with an existing asset.

To see how we can evaluate opportunity costs of this kind, consider an example. Suppose you run a plant that mixes, bags, and ships potting soil—the soil often used for potted plants kept in people’s homes. The bagging machine at your plant has sufficient excess capacity to handle forecasted sales increases for the next five years if you stick to the potting-soil business. However, one of your managers has proposed that your plant diversify into the mulch business. If you use the existing bagging machine to bag mulch, you will have to purchase a second bagging machine in three years instead of in five years. The cost of a second, identical machine would be $100,000, and this machine would have a five-year life. If the appropriate opportunity cost of capital is 10 percent, how should you account for the opportunity cost of using the bagging machine when computing the NPV of the mulch project?

The first step is to compute the EAC for the second bagging machine. It is:

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 11.2
Deciding When to Replace an Asset

Situation

You are trying to decide when to replace your car. It is already five years old, and maintenance costs keep increasing each year as more and more parts wear out and need to be replaced. You do not really care whether or not your car is new, you just want a car that gets you around at the lowest cost. You expect maintenance costs for your car to be $1,000 next year and then increase by $500 each year after that. Your car will be worthless in five years. As an alternative, you can buy a new car with a five-year warranty that will cover all maintenance costs. The new car will cost $15,000, and you expect to be able to sell it for $10,000 in five years. The gas mileage for both cars is the same. You calculate the EAC for each option using a 10 percent opportunity cost of capital. The NPV for your old car is:

and the EAC is −$1,905.06. The NPV for the new car is:

and the EAC is −$2,318.99. When should you replace your old car?



This tells us that the bagging machine costs $26,380 per year. If you decide to get into the mulch business, this cost, which would not otherwise be incurred until Year 5, will also be incurred in Years 3 and 4. Therefore, the opportunity cost of using the excess bagging capacity equals the present value of the additional cost incurred in Years 3 and 4:

This cost should be included in the incremental cash flows for the mulch business. If the mulch project has a negative NPV with this cost, you might consider examining whether it has a positive NPV if you run the mulch business for only the next three years, while there is no constraint on the bagging capacity. A positive NPV in this latter analysis would indicate that the project should be pursued for three years and then abandoned.

11.5 Harvesting an Asset
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Determine the appropriate time to harvest an asset.
Another problem that arises from time to time involves deciding when to harvest an investment. A classic example occurs in the timber industry, where a decision must be made about when to harvest timber. The longer the harvest is delayed, the greater the number of board feet that can be obtained (since trees grow) and, assuming the price of lumber is constant, the greater the value of the harvested lumber. If the number of board feet that will be realized in the harvest and the price per board foot at any point in time is known, making the right decision involves a relatively straightforward application of concepts that we have already discussed.

For example, suppose that you own some land on which you planted pine trees 10 years ago. The trees can be harvested and sold to a pulp mill at any time now, but you want to make sure that you choose the point in time that maximizes the NPV of your investment in the trees. You have estimated the NPV (which equals the after-tax cash flow at the time of the harvest) of harvesting the trees today (Year 0) and for each of the next four years to be as follows:

If each of these NPVs is stated in dollars as of the time when the harvest would take place, we cannot compare them directly. They must first be restated in dollars adjusted to the same point in time. If the opportunity cost of capital is 10 percent, we can make this adjustment simply by discounting each of the NPV values to Year 0. The discounted values are as follows:

where NPVx,y refers to the NPV in Year x dollars if the trees are harvested in Year y. From these numbers, we can see that harvesting at the end of Year 2 will produce the largest NPV in today’s dollars.

If you calculate the percentage increase in the nominal NPV values above, you can see that they increase by 15 percent from Year 0 to 1, by 13 percent from Year 1 to 2, by 9 percent from Year 2 to 3, and by 6 percent from Year 3 to 4. The optimal time to harvest is prior to the first year in which the rate of increase drops below the cost of capital. That is at the end of year 2 where the Year 0 NPV is $37,589. At this time it becomes optimal to harvest the trees and invest the proceeds in alternative investments that yield the opportunity cost of capital because you can earn more from the alternative investments. Another way of thinking about this is that you do not want to harvest as long as the asset is earning a return that is greater than or equal to the opportunity cost of capital. This general principle applies to all problems of this kind.

In our example, we are ignoring the fact that the sooner we harvest the trees, the sooner we can plant the next crop. In this sense the solution is somewhat simplistic—we should really be considering the NPVs for a series of crops—but it illustrates the key points that (1) you must state all NPV values as of the same point in time and (2) the optimal time to harvest an asset is when it is no longer earning at least the opportunity cost of capital.

Outside of the timber industry, these ideas are widely used to decide when to exit investments. For example, leveraged-buyout specialists, who buy companies with the intention of improving and then selling them within a few years, perform a very similar type of analysis when choosing the appropriate time to sell a company.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Explain why incremental after-tax free cash flows are relevant in evaluating a project and calculate them for a project.

The incremental after-tax free cash flows, FCFs, for a project equal the expected change in the total after-tax free cash flows of the firm if the project is adopted. The impact of a project on the firm’s total cash flows is the appropriate measure of cash flows because these are the cash flows that reflect all of the costs and benefits from the project and only the costs and benefits from the project. The incremental after-tax free cash flows are calculated using Equation 11.2. This calculation is also illustrated in Exhibit 11.1.

2 Discuss the five general rules for incremental after-tax free cash flow calculations and explain why cash flows stated in nominal (real) dollars should be discounted using a nominal (real) discount rate.

The five general rules are as follows:

Rule 1: Include cash flows and only cash flows in your calculations. Stockholders care about only the impact of a project on the firm’s cash flows.

Rule 2: Include the impact of the project on cash flows from other product lines. If a project affects the cash flows from other projects, we must take this into account in the NPV analysis in order to fully capture the impact of the project on the firm’s total cash flows.

Rule 3: Include all opportunity costs. If an asset is used for a project, the relevant cost for that asset is the value that could be realized from its most valuable alternative use. By including this cost in the NPV analysis, we capture the change in the firm’s cash flows that is attributable to the use of this asset for the project.

Rule 4: Forget sunk costs. The only costs that matter are those to be incurred from this point on.

Rule 5: Include only after-tax cash flows in the cash flow calculations. Since stockholders receive cash flows after taxes have been paid, they are concerned only about after-tax cash flows.

Since a nominal discount rate reflects both the expected rate of inflation and a real return, we would be overadjusting for inflation if we discounted a real cash flow with a nominal rate. Similarly, if we discounted a nominal cash flow using a real discount rate, we would be undercompensating for expected inflation in the discounting process. This is why we discount nominal cash flows using only a nominal discount rate and we discount real cash flows using only a real discount rate.

3 Describe how distinguishing between variable and fixed costs can be useful in forecasting operating expenses.

Variable costs vary directly with the number of units sold, while fixed costs do not. When forecasting operating expenses, it is often useful to treat variable and fixed costs separately. We can forecast variable costs by multiplying unit variable costs by the number of units sold. Fixed costs are more accurately based on the specific characteristics of those costs, rather than as a function of sales. Separating fixed costs from variable costs also makes it easier to identify the factors that will cause them to change over time and therefore easier to forecast them.

4 Explain the concept of equivalent annual cost and use it to compare projects with unequal lives, decide when to replace an existing asset, and calculate the opportunity cost of using an existing asset.

The equivalent annual cost (EAC) is the annualized cost of an investment that is stated in nominal dollars. In other words, it is the annual payment from an annuity that has the same NPV and the same life as the project. Since it is a measure of the annual cost or cash inflow from a project, the EAC for one project can be compared directly with the EAC from another project, regardless of the lives of those two projects. Application of the EAC concept is illustrated in Section 11.4.

5 Determine the appropriate time to harvest an asset.

The appropriate time to harvest an asset is that point in time where harvesting the asset yields the largest present value, in today’s dollars, of the project NPV.

11.35 Biotech Partners LLC has been farming a new strain of radioactive-material-eating bacteria that the electrical utility industry can use to help dispose of its nuclear waste. Two opposing factors affect Biotech’s decision of when to harvest the bacteria: the growth rate of the bacteria and its market price. The bacteria are currently growing at a 22 percent annual rate. Due to competition from other top firms, Biotech analysts estimate that the price for the bacteria will decline according to the schedule below. If the opportunity cost of capital is 10 percent, and free cash flows change in the same way as the change in market price, Biotech should harvest the entire bacteria colony at the end of which year?

11.36 ACME Manufacturing management is considering replacing an existing production line with a new line that has a greater output capacity and operates with less labor than the existing line. The new line would cost $1 million, have a five-year life, and be depreciated using the MACRS three-year schedule. At the end of five years, the new line could be sold as scrap for $200,000 (in Year 5 dollars). Because the new line is more automated, it would require fewer operators, resulting in a savings of $40,000 per year before tax and unadjusted for inflation (in today’s dollars). Additional sales with the new machine are expected to result in additional net cash inflows, before tax, of $60,000 per year (in today’s dollars). If ACME invests in the new line, a one-time investment of $10,000 in additional working capital will be required. The working capital investment will be recovered at the end of the project’s life. The tax rate is 28 percent, the opportunity cost of capital is 10 percent, and the annual rate of inflation is 3 percent. What is the NPV of the new production line?

11.37 The alternative to investing in the new production line in Problem 11.36 is to overhaul the existing line, which currently has both a book value and a salvage value of $0. It would cost $300,000 to overhaul the existing line, but this expenditure would extend its useful life to five years. The line would have a $0 salvage value at the end of five years. The overhaul outlay would be capitalized and depreciated using the MACRS three-year schedule. Should ACME replace or renovate the existing line?

11.38 Paye’s Panes manufactures insulated windowpanes. The company’s CFO has asked you to assess a new manufacturing plant she is considering. The initial cost will be $475,000. While for tax purposes the plant can be depreciated straight-line to zero book value over 10 years, the CFO expects that the firm will sell the plant at the end of Year 5. At that time, the CFO estimates that there is a 20 percent chance that the plant can be sold for $80,000, a 30 percent chance it can be sold for $70,000, and a 50 percent chance that it can be sold for $25,000. The initial investment in working capital of $30,000 will be recovered when the machine is sold. Additional revenues from the plant are expected to be $205,000 per year, and additional operating costs will be $73,000 per year. The firm has a marginal tax rate of 23 percent and a 9 percent cost of capital. (a) What is the NPV of the new plant? (b) You complete your analysis and read in the Wall Street Journal that a new process for making insulated window will be available five years from today. You believe that this will lower the Year 5 sales price of the plant dramatically. To the nearest dollar, what is the lowest amount that you can sell the plant for and still recommend to your CFO that she undertake the investment?

Sample Test Problems
11.1 You purchased 100 shares of stock in an oil company, Texas Energy, Inc., at $50 per share. The company has 1 million shares outstanding. Ten days later, Texas Energy announced an investment in an oil field in east Texas. The probability that the investment will be successful and generate an NPV of $10 million is 0.2; the probability that the investment will be a failure and generate an NPV of negative $1 million is 0.8. How would you expect the stock price to change upon the company’s announcement of the investment?

11.2 A division of Virginia City Highlands Manufacturing is considering purchasing a machine for $1,500,000 that automates the process of inserting electronic components onto computer motherboards. The annual cost of operating the machine will be $50,000, but it will save the company $370,000 in labor costs each year. The machine will have a useful life of 10 years, and its salvage value in 10 years is estimated to be $300,000. However, for tax purposes the initial purchase price of the machine will be depreciated straight-line to zero. If the marginal corporate tax rate is 21 percent and the appropriate discount rate is 12 percent, what is the NPV of this project?

11.3 After examining the NPV analysis for a potential project that would increase the firm’s output by 5 percent, an analyst’s manager tells the analyst to increase the initial fixed capital outlay in the analysis by $480,000. The initial fixed capital outlay would be fully depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 12-year life, regardless of whether it was increased. If the firm’s average tax rate is 23 percent, its marginal tax rate is 30 percent, and the required rate of return is 10 percent, what is the effect of the adjustment on the project NPV?

11.4 Which of the following are relevant cash flows in the evaluation of a proposal to produce a new product?

Decrease in the cash flows of a substitute product.
Alternative of leasing an existing building that would be used for manufacturing this product.
The cost of a new machine required to produce this product.
Salvage value of the new machine at the end of its useful life.
Increase in net working capital at the beginning of the project’s life.
Cost to develop a product prototype last year.
11.5 Managers of Central Embroidery have decided to purchase a new monogram machine and are considering two alternatives. The first machine costs $100,000 and is expected to last five years. The second machine costs $160,000 and is expected to last eight years. Assume that the opportunity cost of capital is 8 percent. Which machine should Central Embroidery purchase?

11.6 You have inherited an apple orchard and want to sell it in the next four years. An expert in apple orchard valuation has estimated the after-tax cash flow you would receive if you sold at the end of each of the next four years as follows: $1,000,000 if you sell in one year; $1,300,000 if you sell in two years; $1,500,000 if you sell in three years; and $1,600,000 if you sell in four years. Your opportunity cost of capital is 10 percent. When should you sell the orchard?

Ethics Case
Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan
Sustainability is all the buzz in business and is quickly becoming a mainstream topic. Governments as well as customers have been urging corporations to make themselves sustainable, but what does that mean?


What Is Sustainability?

Sustainability is acting to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. For individuals it is a lifestyle that attempts to reduce an individual’s or society’s use of Earth’s natural resources. The European Union has adopted sustainability as an official policy, urging companies to follow sustainable practices as a means of achieving their corporate social responsibility goals to contribute to a better society and a cleaner environment.

Unilever’s Sustainability Plan

Talking about sustainability is one thing; doing it is another. In late 2010 Unilever took action by unveiling its global Sustainable Living Plan. Launched simultaneously in London, New York, Amsterdam, and New Delhi, the plan would affect all of Unilever’s stakeholders worldwide—customers, suppliers, investors, employees, and the local communities where Unilever products are sold. It’s not unusual for a company to try to reduce its CO2 emissions or to reduce waste and water usage in its own manufacturing facilities. But Unilever’s plan went far beyond its plants. According to the company’s management, more than two-thirds of greenhouse emissions and half the water in Unilever products’ life cycles come from consumer use. Therefore, extending the plan to include consumers was a commitment on an unprecedented scale.

Accomplishing the Company’s Sustainability Goals

Technological advances would enable the firm to achieve some of its sustainability goals. The company was developing products such as laundry detergents that work at lower temperatures and bath soaps that reduce the amount of hot water needed in showers and baths.

Company management intended to accomplish other parts of its plan by requiring that suppliers meet sustainability goals.

Finally, Unilever management planned to meet some goals by changing consumers’ habits. For example, by 2015 Unilever aimed to change the hygiene behavior of 1 billion consumers across Asia, Africa, and Latin America by promoting the benefits of hand washing with soap at key times. Though this may seem rudimentary by Western standards, every year more than 3.5 million children die before age five due to diarrhea and acute respiratory infections. Much of this is from poor hygiene habits.1

Overall, through its ambitious sustainability plan, Unilever management intended to (1) improve the health and well-being of more than 1 billion people; (2) purchase 100 percent of its agricultural raw material from sustainable businesses; and (3) reduce the environmental impact of everything it sells by one-half over the following 10 years while doubling its revenue. The major challenge the company faced was to increase sales without also increasing its environmental footprint. Dave Lewis, president of Unilever America, recognized this dilemma: “We cannot choose between growth and sustainability. We have to do both.”

Critics of the plan pointed out that much of its success depended on changing consumer behavior, which was largely beyond Unilever’s control. Probably more important, critics questioned whether the adoption of the plan would contribute to Unilever’s bottom line. Being green and socially responsible are all well and good, but a public company needs to make money. A company that is not financially successful is not sustainable, good intentions notwithstanding.

Integrating Business Strategy and Sustainability Strategy

What makes Unilever’s plan so intriguing to many is the way it integrates business strategy and sustainability strategy. Let’s take one example: health and hygiene. Unilever claimed it would use its Lifebuoy brand soap to encourage more hand washing in an effort to reduce diarrhea and respiratory diseases spread by germs. It would use its fluoride toothpaste and toothbrush brands to encourage brushing twice a day, which would reduce tooth decay in children by 50 percent compared to brushing once. It would make safe drinking water available to 500 million people through its affordable Pureit in-home water purifier. Through its Dove Social Mission, Unilever intended to use one of its best-known brands to enhance the self-esteem and thus improve the mental health of young women around the world.

Large companies are often criticized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). In the past, as a company headquartered in Europe where NGOs are particularly active, Unilever has been a target of such criticism. A common corporate strategy is to fight back. However, with its Sustainable Living Plan, Unilever endorsed many NGO recommendations. For example, Unilever would use eggs from 100 percent cage-free chickens in all of its products—a common demand from animal rights NGOs. All Lipton tea would be purchased from Rainforest Alliance certified suppliers. Even Ben and Jerry’s ice cream would be made from ingredients that are fair-trade certified.

In rural India, Unilever planned to link 500,000 small farmers into a unified supply network to improve their farming practices. The farmers would be required to adhere to Unilever’s Sustainable Agriculture Code and for the first time would benefit from economies of scale that could improve their lives. What’s in it for Unilever? Relationships with a vastly expanded network of sustainable suppliers producing products at competitive prices. Building an adequate source of supplies is especially critical in a world where food shortages may become more common.

Critical Concerns and Responses

Is Unilever simply using the sustainability mantra as a device to increase its profits? To its critics, Unilever’s motives are suspect. They claim it is pursuing sustainability, not because it is the right thing to do, but because it is good business. But are these two goals mutually exclusive? Can a firm’s strategy seek to be profitable and sustainable? What’s wrong with doing well by doing good? Nothing, according to Unilever management. They intend to lead the way in being a profitable, sustainable corporation.

Discussion Questions
Should Unilever’s stockholders endorse a sustainability plan? Why or why not?
Are there business advantages to using sustainable or green suppliers? If so, what are they? If not, do you think a traditional return on investment analysis captures all possible benefits of going green?
Are there any ethical criticisms of Unilever’s sustainable living strategy? If so, what are they?

Notes
1 The concept of opportunity cost here is similar to that discussed in Chapter 10 as it relates to the cost of capital.
2 As discussed in Chapter 2, if we multiply the two terms on the right-hand side of Equation 11.3, we get 1 + k = 1 + ΔPe + r + ΔPer. Since the last term in this equation, ΔPer, is the product of two fractions, it is a very small number and is often ignored in practice. Without this term, Equation 11.3 becomes 1 + k = 1 + ΔPe + r or k = ΔPe + r.
3 Note that when we use the term cost of capital without distinguishing between the nominal and the real cost of capital, we are referring to the nominal cost of capital. This is the convention that is used in practice. In this example, we use the term nominal or real whenever we refer to the cost of capital for clarity. In the rest of this book, however, we follow convention by simply using the term cost of capital to refer to the nominal cost of capital.
4 Although some assets that were acquired before 1986 are still being depreciated using earlier methods, the vast majority of depreciation for existing assets and all depreciation for new assets are based on MACRS.
5 Under GAAP accounting rules, if the salvage value can be estimated with reasonable certainty, it should be used in computing depreciation. However, in practice the expected salvage value of a new capital asset is so often uncertain that it is typically assumed to equal $0 even for financial reporting purposes.
6 Including the tax savings as negative capital expenditure increases the FCF in Year 10 since we subtract all capital expenditures.
7 For simplicity, the dollar values in Exhibit 11.9 and the associated calculations are reported in thousands.
8 In some instances, costs are “fixed” in the short run but variable in the long run. For example, if a firm leases manufacturing space under a long-term contract, it may not be possible to reduce the lease expense immediately if demand for the firm’s products falls. However, it will be possible to do so at the expiration of the lease or by sub-leasing excess space.
9 If you don’t expect to replace the machines as they wear out (for instance, if you plan to quit the mowing business in one year), then you can calculate the NPV of each mower, including the salvage values that you expect to realize for each at the end of the year, and choose the mower with the larger NPV.
10 We could have also calculated the NPV for Model B by discounting the $500 annual electricity savings by 10 percent and adding the present value of that savings stream to the $50,000 initial cost. Using this NPV in the EAC formula would also yield −$6,838.16.
1 Studies by Unilever have shown that hand washing at key hygienic occasions can reduce diarrheal disease by 25 percent, respiratory infection by 19 percent, and eye infections by 46 percent.

During the third quarter of 2020, General Mills, the manufacturer of iconic consumer food brands, including Betty Crocker, Cheerios, Nature Valley, and Pillsbury, among others, announced major expansions of several of its production facilities. These included a $37 million overhaul of its Cedar Rapids, Iowa, plant and an expansion of its Covington, Georgia, cereal operations that a company spokeswoman said was “one of the largest capital projects in General Mills history.”

The focus of these investments was to modernize the firm’s production lines with the goal of increasing efficiency and expanding production capacity to meet the increased demand for General Mills’ products that resulted from the COVID-19 outbreak.

As with any other capital investment, modernizing production facilities involves a great deal of uncertainty. If you put yourself in the shoes of the managers of General Mills, you can imagine the concerns they had about the projects they were undertaking and how the market for the products they produced would evolve over time. The firm’s managers probably asked themselves detailed questions regarding the economics of the new projects: What level of unit sales would be required to cover costs? Would the increased demand for the company’s products be sustained over the longer term? How would competitors respond, and what effect would competitors’ responses have on the firm’s revenues and profits over the long run? If the company was successful with these new investments, how much value would be created for investors? Answering such questions is part of any thorough project analysis. This chapter discusses some of the tools and methods used to obtain the answers.

Chapter Preview
Financial analysts who forecast the free cash flows used in an NPV analysis realize that actual cash flows will almost certainly differ from their forecasts. No one can predict what will happen in the future! For this reason, it is important to understand the economic characteristics of a project and the implications of being wrong. This chapter discusses key tools and methods that analysts use to develop this understanding.

We first discuss how a project’s cost structure affects its risk and how analysts measure this effect. We then describe break-even analysis, which is used to determine how many units must be sold in order for a project to break even. These concepts help analysts better understand the economic characteristics of projects and provide insights into how projects can be structured to maximize their value.

We end with a discussion of how financial analysts evaluate the uncertainties associated with cash flow forecasts. These techniques allow analysts to determine which characteristics of a project have the greatest impact on the level of the cash flows, how market or economic conditions affect the cash flows of the business, and the probability that certain levels of cash flows will be realized.

12.1 Variable Costs, Fixed Costs, and Project Risk
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain and demonstrate how variable costs and fixed costs affect the volatility of pretax operating cash flows and accounting operating profits.
Two questions are always on the mind of a financial analyst evaluating a project: “How wrong can my free cash flow forecasts be?” and “What are the implications if my forecasts are wrong?” It is natural to ask these questions, since the actual incremental after-tax free cash flows (FCF) for a project will almost certainly differ from the forecasted FCF. This chapter discusses some important tools that help provide answers.

To fully understand how to evaluate project risk, you must first understand how variable costs and fixed costs affect the risk of a business. Recall from Chapter 11 that variable costs are costs that vary directly with the number of units sold. An example of a variable cost is the cost of the ingredients that a pizza parlor uses to make its pizzas. The total cost of these ingredients increases or decreases as the number of pizzas sold increases or decreases. Fixed costs, in contrast, do not vary with unit sales—at least in the short run. An example of a fixed cost in a pizza parlor is the salary of the manager. As pizza sales go up and down from month to month, the cost of the manager’s salary remains constant.

The cash flows and accounting profits for a project are sensitive to the proportion of its costs that is variable and the proportion that is fixed. A project with a higher proportion of fixed costs will have cash flows and accounting profits that are more sensitive to changes in revenues than an otherwise identical project with a lower proportion of fixed costs. This is because the costs of a project with a higher proportion of fixed costs will not change as much when revenue changes.

To illustrate this point, we can represent the incremental cash operating expenses, Op Ex, from Equation 11.2 as

(12.1)
where VC is the incremental variable costs associated with a project and FC is the incremental fixed costs. Equation 12.1 simply says that all cash operating expenses are either variable costs or fixed costs.

Let’s carry this equation a bit further. We know from Exhibit 11.1 that

Thus, Equation 12.1 suggests that we can write EBITDA as

You might recall from Chapter 11 that EBITDA is the incremental earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and Revenue is the incremental revenue from a project. EBITDA is often called pretax operating cash flow because it equals the incremental pretax cash operating profits from a project. Strictly speaking, EBITDA is not a complete measure of cash flow because it does not include the effects of working capital requirements and capital expenditures on cash flows. Nevertheless, it is a very commonly used measure.

pretax operating cash flow earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA

Cost Structure and Sensitivity of EBITDA to Revenue Changes
To see how writing the calculation of EBITDA in terms of fixed and variable costs can be helpful, consider this situation: You have been trying to decide whether to buy a hammock-manufacturing business in which hammocks are currently made by hand.1 However, you have just found out about an automated hammock-manufacturing system. This means that, in addition to deciding whether to go into the hammock business, you must choose between two manufacturing alternatives: (1) investing in manufacturing equipment that will largely automate the production process and (2) relying on the current manufacturing method in which hammocks are produced by hand. Assume that the per-unit variable costs (Unit VC) and the total fixed costs (FC) and depreciation and amortization (D&A) for the two alternatives are as presented in Exhibit 12.1. How would you evaluate the relative advantages and disadvantages of the automated and the manual production alternatives?

One thing you might do is compare the sensitivity of EBITDA to changes in revenue for the two alternatives. This can help you better understand the risks and returns for the alternatives. To see why, assume that the sensitivity of EBITDA to changes in revenue is higher for one alternative than for the other. This means that EBITDA for the more sensitive alternative will decline more when revenue is lower than expected. A larger decline in EBITDA can cause problems not only because it reduces the value of the project more, but also because it has a greater impact on the amount of cash that the firm has available to fund other positive NPV projects. In an extreme case, a drop in EBITDA can unexpectedly force the firm to invest additional money in the project. On the positive side, EBITDA will increase more when revenue is greater than expected if the sensitivity of EBITDA to revenue is higher. Whether this potential benefit justifies the risks is a decision that you would have to make when choosing between the two alternatives. Comparing the sensitivity of EBITDA to changes in revenue for the two alternatives will at least help you better understand the trade-offs.

EXHIBIT 12.1 Unit and Annual Costs for Hammock Project

To evaluate the automated and manual production alternatives in our hammock-manufacturing example, we start with information about the variable costs per unit (Unit VC), fixed costs (FC), and depreciation and amortization (D&A).

 	Automated Production	Manual Production
Unit VC:	 	 
 Labor	          $1	        $5
 Rope	           5	         5
 Spacer bars	           2	         2
 Hardware	           2	         2
 Packaging	           2	         2
 Shipping and other	           4	         4
      Total	      $16	    $20
FC	$35,000	$4,000
D&A	$10,000	$1,000
EXHIBIT 12.2 EBITDA under Alternative Production Technologies

Here we calculate EBITDA for the automated and manual production alternatives in the hammock-manufacturing example. The calculations use the information provided in Exhibit 12.1 and assume that 10,000 units are sold at a price of $25 per unit.
 	Automated Production	Manual Production
Units sold	  10,000	  10,000
Unit price	        $25	        $25
Unit VC	        $16	        $20
 Revenue	$250,000	$250,000
− VC	  160,000	  200,000
− FC         	   35,000	      4,000
= EBITDA	$ 55,000	$ 46,000
Distinguishing between fixed and variable costs enables us to calculate the sensitivity of EBITDA to changes in revenue. For example, suppose you expect to sell 10,000 hammocks next year at an average price of $25 each. Based on the costs in Exhibit 12.1, you would forecast EBITDA to be $55,000 under the automated production alternative and $46,000 under the manual production alternative.2 These calculations are presented in Exhibit 12.2.

Although selling 10,000 units represents your best estimate of what you can expect, you might also envision a situation in which demand would be poor and sales would equal only 8,000 units, 20 percent less than your best estimate. Distinguishing between fixed and variable costs makes it relatively straightforward to determine how EBITDA would be affected if only 8,000 units were sold. This “Poor Demand” scenario is illustrated in columns 2 and 4 of Exhibit 12.3 for the automated production and manual production alternatives (assuming that Unit VC does not change with unit sales). Columns 1 and 3 are identical to the two columns in Exhibit 12.2.

EXHIBIT 12.3 Changes in EBITDA under Alternative Production Technologies

EBITDA for the automated and manual production alternatives in the hammock-manufacturing example declines by different amounts when the number of units sold declines 20 percent and the unit price remains the same.

 	Automated Production	 	Manual Production
 	Expected Demand (1)	Poor Demand (2)	 	Expected Demand (3)	Poor Demand (4)
Units sold	    10,000	       8,000	 	     10,000	       8,000
Unit price	         $25	          $25	 	         $25	          $25
Unit VC	         $16	          $16	 	         $20	          $20
 Revenue	$250,000	$200,000	 	$250,000	$200,000
− VC	160,000	128,000	 	200,000	160,000
− FC         	   35,000	   35,000	 	     4,000	     4,000
= EBITDA	$ 55,000	$ 37,000	 	$ 46,000	$ 36,000
Percent change in revenuea	 	  −20.0%	 	 	  −20.0%
Percent change in EBITDA	 	  −32.7%	 	 	  −21.7%
aThe percent change in revenue is calculated as:

Percent change = (RevenuePoor − RevenueExpected)/RevenueExpected

          = ($200,000 − $250,000)/$250,000 = −0.20, or −20%

All other percent changes are calculated this way in the exhibits.

EXHIBIT 12.4 EBITDA for Different Levels of Unit Sales The sensitivity of EBITDA to changes in unit sales differs for the automated and manual production alternatives in the hammock-manufacturing example. The steeper line for the automated production alternative means that EBITDA for this alternative is more sensitive to changes in the number of units sold.


Exhibit 12.3 shows that EBITDA is much more sensitive to changes in revenue with the automated production process than with the manual process. A 20 percent decline in revenue results in a 32.7 percent decline in EBITDA with the automated production process, but only a 21.7 percent decline in EBITDA with the manual production process—an 11 percentage point difference. The reason for the difference is that more of the total costs are fixed with the automated process, making it more difficult to adjust costs when revenue changes. Because of this difference, the difference in EBITDA between the two production alternatives shrinks from $9,000 ($55,000 − $46,000 = $9,000) when unit sales are 10,000 to only $1,000 ($37,000 − $36,000 = $1,000) when unit sales are 8,000.

You can see how the difference in EBITDA initially shrinks as the number of units sold declines from 20,000 units in Exhibit 12.4, which shows how EBITDA changes as the number of units sold changes for both the manual and the automated production process. Notice that the relation between EBITDA and the number of units sold is steeper with the automated production process, where there are more fixed costs. A steeper line indicates that EBITDA for the automated production process is more sensitive to changes in the number of units sold.

Note also that the effect of changes in the number of units sold is symmetrical because the relation between EBITDA and the number of units sold is linear. This means that the automated production process will produce larger declines in EBITDA when unit sales are lower than expected and larger increases in EBITDA when unit sales are higher than expected. This is exactly what we were referring to earlier when we said that when pretax operating cash flows are more sensitive to changes in revenue, they will decline more when revenue is lower than expected and increase more when revenue is greater than expected.

Cost Structure and Sensitivity of EBIT to Revenue Changes
Exhibit 12.5 expands the analysis in Exhibit 12.3 to illustrate how the sensitivity of accounting operating profits (EBIT) to changes in revenue differs under the two hammock-manufacturing alternatives. The sensitivity of EBIT to changes in revenue is of concern to managers because EBIT is a performance measure that is of interest to investors.

EXHIBIT 12.5 Changes in EBITDA and EBIT under Alternative Production Technologies

The EBIT values for the automated and manual production alternatives in the hammock-manufacturing example decline more than the EBITDA values when the number of units sold declines 20 percent and the unit price remains the same. This occurs because the fixed nature of depreciation and amortization (D&A) charges has the same effect as other fixed costs. When D&A is greater than zero, the percentage change in EBIT is greater than the percentage change in EBITDA.

 	Automated Production	 	Manual Production
 	Expected Demand (1)	Poor Demand (2)	 	Expected Demand (3)	Poor Demand (4)
Units sold	     10,000	       8,000	 	     10,000	       8,000
Unit price	         $25	          $25	 	         $25	          $25
Unit VC	         $16	          $16	 	         $20	          $20
   Revenue	$250,000	$200,000	 	$250,000	$200,000
− VC	  160,000	  128,000	 	  200,000	  160,000
− FC         	    35,000	    35,000	 	      4,000	      4,000
= EBITDA	$ 55,000	$ 37,000	 	$ 46,000	$ 36,000
− D&A 	    10,000	    10,000	 	      1,000	      1,000
= EBIT	  $ 45,000	  $ 27,000	 	  $ 45,000	  $ 35,000
Percent change in revenue	 	  −20.0%	 	 	  −20.0%
Percent change in EBITDA	 	  −32.7%	 	 	  −21.7%
Percent change in EBIT	 	  −40.0%	 	 	  −22.2%
Building Intuition
High Fixed Costs Mean Larger Fluctuations in Cash Flows and Profits

The higher the proportion of fixed costs to variable costs in a project, the more pretax operating cash flows (EBITDA) and accounting operating profits (EBIT) will vary as revenue varies. This is true because it is more difficult to change fixed costs than to change variable costs when unit sales change. If unit sales decline, EBITDA and EBIT will decrease more in a business where fixed costs represent a larger proportion of total costs. Conversely, if unit sales increase, EBITDA and EBIT will increase more in a business with higher fixed costs.

In Exhibit 12.5 you can see that the 20 percent decline in revenue results in a 40 percent decline in EBIT with the automated production process but only a 22.2 percent decline in EBIT with the manual production process. The difference in the decline in EBIT is 17.8 percentage points! This difference is larger than the 11 percentage point difference for EBITDA because the EBITDA calculation does not include D&A. Depreciation and amortization acts just like a fixed cost when we include it in the calculation because it is based on the amount that was invested in the project rather than on unit sales. Therefore, when we include D&A in the EBIT calculation, we effectively increase the proportion of costs that is fixed. Note that, since D&A is larger for the automated production alternative, including it in the calculation has a greater impact on the sensitivity of EBIT to changes in revenue for the automated production alternative than for the manual alternative. This is why the difference in the decline in EBIT is so much larger than the corresponding difference for EBITDA.

If we recreated Exhibit 12.4 for EBIT, the slope would be steeper for the automated production process than for the manual production process. As was the case with EBITDA, the linear relation between changes in revenue and EBIT indicates that there are benefits and costs associated with using the automated production process. When deciding whether to use the automated process, you must weigh the prospect of higher accounting operating profits if unit sales exceed expected levels against concerns about lower accounting operating profits if unit sales are below expectations. In other words, you must decide whether the potential for earning a higher return with the automated manufacturing process justifies the risks. In Chapter 16 we will discuss how greater volatility in operating profits increases the chances that a firm will be forced into bankruptcy.

Learning by Doing Applications 12.1 and 12.2 illustrate calculations of an EBIT forecast and its sensitivity to changes in the inputs. The Using Excel Example that follows shows the spreadsheet setup for the sensitivity analysis.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 12.1
Forecasting EBIT

Problem

You have decided to start a business that provides in-home technical computer support to people in the community near your university. You have seen national advertisements for a company that provides these services in other communities. You would run this business out of your dorm room, and you know plenty of students who have the necessary technical skills and would welcome the opportunity to take a side gig. To get up and running quickly, you would have to invest in a computer system, an advertising campaign, three vehicles, and tools. You would also want to have enough cash to keep the business going until it began to generate positive cash flows. All of this would require about $100,000, which is all that you can borrow on your credit cards, against your car, and from friends and family.

You are now working on the financial forecasts for the business. You plan to charge $45 for house calls lasting up to 30 minutes and $25 for each additional 30 minutes. Since you expect that the typical house call will require 60 minutes, you expect it to result in revenue of $70. You also estimate that monthly fixed operating costs (FC), which include an advertising contract with a local radio station and a small salary for you, will total $3,000. Unit VC, including the technicians’ pay, gas, and so forth, will total $20 for the typical house call. Monthly depreciation and amortization charges (D&A) will be $1,000. Finally, you expect that after six months the business will average 120 house calls per month. Given this information, what do you expect the monthly EBIT to be in six months?





LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 12.2
Fixed Costs and Fluctuations in EBIT

Problem

As you prepare the financial forecast for your computer-support business, you worry about the impact of fluctuations in the number of house calls on EBIT. You decide to examine how converting some fixed costs to variable costs will affect the sensitivity of EBIT to changes in the number of house calls. In a conversation with the manager at the radio station where you would be advertising, you discover that instead of paying $1,500 per month under a long-term advertising contract, you can get the same level of advertising for $1,600, where $1,000 of the total cost is fixed and $600 is variable. That is, in a given month, if you used the full level of advertising, you would pay $1,600, but you would also have the ability to reduce advertising costs to $1,000 by cutting back on the number of advertisements. You wonder how this contract would affect the sensitivity of EBIT to a decrease in the monthly number of house calls—say, from 120 to 90.





Using Excel
Examining the Impact of Changes in Your Assumptions

One of the main advantages of using a spreadsheet for financial analysis is that it enables us to perform a sensitivity analysis in a matter of seconds. Once the spreadsheet is carefully set up with all the relevant key assumptions and calculations, we can change any one of the assumptions and immediately see the effect on the bottom line.

Below is a setup for Learning by Doing Applications 12.1 and 12.2 that analyzes the impact of the alternative advertising schemes on the EBIT of the in-home technical computer-support business.

Notice that the actual EBIT calculation is entirely derived from formulas utilizing inputs from the key assumptions. To use the model for sensitivity analysis, all you have to do is change the values for the volume of house calls per month for the two advertising alternatives (in cell B11 and D11). For example, when you change the volume number for the alternative advertising scenario back to 120, EBIT equals $1,900, just as it does in Learning by Doing Application 12.2.

12.2 Calculating Operating Leverage
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Calculate and distinguish between the degree of pretax cash flow operating leverage and the degree of accounting operating leverage.
The examples in Section 12.1 illustrate the impact of operating leverage on pretax operating cash flows and on accounting operating profits when revenue changes. Operating leverage is a measure of the relative amounts of fixed and variable costs in a project’s cost structure. It is the major factor that determines the sensitivity of EBITDA or EBIT to changes in revenue. The higher a project’s operating leverage, the greater these sensitivities. Two measures of operating leverage often used by analysts are the degree of pretax cash flow operating leverage and the degree of accounting operating leverage.

operating leverage a measure of the relative amounts of fixed and variable costs in a project’s cost structure; operating leverage is higher with more fixed costs

Degree of Pretax Cash Flow Operating Leverage
The degree of pretax cash flow operating leverage (Cash Flow DOL) provides us with a measure of how sensitive pretax operating cash flows are to changes in revenue. It is calculated using the following formula:

(12.2)
degree of pretax cash flow operating leverage (Cash Flow DOL) a measure of the sensitivity of cash flows from operations (EBITDA) to changes in revenue

Using the FC and EBITDA values in Exhibit 12.2, we can calculate Cash Flow DOL for the automated production alternative in the hammock-manufacturing example as follows:

This indicates that a 1 percent change in revenue will change pretax operating cash flow, EBITDA, by 1.64 percent. A measure such as this provides analysts with a convenient way of summarizing how much pretax operating cash flow will differ from forecasts if revenue is below or above the expected level.

You should be aware of one limitation to this measure: Cash Flow DOL changes with the level of revenue. In other words, the sensitivity is not the same for all levels of revenue. As a result, a particular Cash Flow DOL measure is only useful for modest changes in revenue. To understand why this limitation exists, notice that the numerator in the fraction in Equation 12.2, FC, does not vary with revenue. In contrast, the denominator, EBITDA, varies directly with revenue if the pretax operating cash flow margin is positive. If revenue is larger, the denominator in Equation 12.2 will be larger for any project that has a positive pretax operating cash flow margin. This, in turn, will cause Cash Flow DOL to become smaller as revenue increases. Alternatively, if revenue is lower, the denominator in the fraction will be smaller, and Cash Flow DOL will be larger.

Consider, for example, how Cash Flow DOL changes for the automated production alternative if unit sales are 20,000 instead of 10,000. Exhibit 12.6 shows us that EBITDA will equal $145,000 with unit sales of 20,000. Therefore, Cash Flow DOL under the automated production alternative at this higher sales volume would be only 1.24:

EXHIBIT 12.6 EBITDA with Unit Sales of 10,000 and 20,000 for the Automated Production Alternative

For the automated production alternative in the hammock-manufacturing example, EBITDA increases from $55,000 to $145,000 when unit sales increase from 10,000 to 20,000 units.

Units sold	    10,000	    20,000
Unit price	         $25	         $25
Unit VC	         $16	         $16
 Revenue	$250,000	$500,000
− VC	  160,000	  320,000
− FC         	     35,000	     35,000
= EBITDA	$ 55,000	$145,000
Degree of Accounting Operating Leverage
While Cash Flow DOL is a measure of the sensitivity of pretax operating cash flows to changes in revenue, the degree of accounting operating leverage (Accounting DOL) is a measure of how sensitive accounting operating profits (EBIT) are to changes in revenue. The formula for Accounting DOL is as follows:

(12.3)
degree of accounting operating leverage (Accounting DOL) a measure of the sensitivity of accounting operating profits (EBIT) to changes in revenue

In this formula, D&A is treated as a fixed cost and is added to FC to obtain the total of a project’s cash and noncash fixed costs on the income statement. This total is then divided by total accounting operating profits (EBIT).4

The only difference between Accounting DOL and Cash Flow DOL is that Accounting DOL focuses on EBIT, whereas Cash Flow DOL focuses on EBITDA. This means that the calculations differ only in the way that D&A is treated, since EBIT = EBITDA − D&A. Note that Accounting DOL will always be larger than Cash Flow DOL if D&A is greater than zero. This is because, compared with the calculation in Equation 12.2, the calculation in Equation 12.3 will have a larger numerator and a smaller denominator when D&A is greater than zero.

Let’s apply the Accounting DOL formula to the automated production alternative in the hammock example. Using the values of FC, D&A, and EBIT from column 1 in Exhibit 12.5, we get:

This tells us that a 1 percent change in revenue will result in a 2 percent change in EBIT. In other words, EBIT will change by twice as much, in percentage terms, as revenue with the automated production alternative!

In comparison, the Accounting DOL for the manual production alternative (column 3 in Exhibit 12.5) is only 1.11:

Building Intuition
Revenue Changes Drive Profit Volatility Through Operating Leverage

If there is no uncertainty about costs, volatility in pretax operating cash flows (EBITDA) and accounting operating profits (EBIT) will be driven entirely by changes in revenue and operating leverage. If a project has any fixed costs associated with it, operating leverage will magnify changes in revenue. The degree of operating leverage is a direct measure of how much more volatile EBITDA and EBIT will be than revenue.

A 1 percent change in revenue will result in only a 1.11 percent change in EBIT with the manual production alternative.

One important insight that you should take away from this discussion is that the volatility of pretax operating cash flows (EBITDA) and accounting operating profits (EBIT) is strongly influenced by two factors: (1) volatility in revenue and (2) operating leverage. If there is no uncertainty regarding what the different costs associated with a project will be, these are the only two factors that determine volatility in EBITDA and EBIT. It is always a good idea to pay special attention to these two factors when you are evaluating the uncertainty associated with the cash flows or the accounting profits from a project.

12.3 Break-Even Analysis
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Define and calculate the pretax operating cash flow and accounting operating profit break-even points and the crossover levels of unit sales for a project.
A question that naturally comes to mind when we consider operating leverage is this: What level of unit sales or revenue is necessary for a project to break even? This is an important question because it helps us better understand how successful the project will have to be in order to succeed. In this section, we discuss break-even analysis, which tells us how many units must be sold in order for a project to break even on a cash flow or accounting profit basis. Break-even analysis also helps us understand how sensitive cash flows and accounting profits are to changes in the number of units that will be sold.

break-even analysis an analysis that tells us how many units must be sold in order for a project to break even on a cash flow or accounting profit basis

Pretax Operating Cash Flow Break-Even
When evaluating a project, we might want to know what level of unit sales is necessary for the project to break even on operations from a pretax operating cash flow perspective. In other words, how many units must be sold for pretax operating cash flow to equal $0? This is a very important question; if the project fails to break even from a pretax operating cash flow perspective, the firm will have to put more cash into the project to keep it going. The pretax operating cash flow (EBITDA) break-even point is calculated as follows:

(12.4)
pretax operating cash flow (EBITDA) break-even point the number of units that must be sold for pretax operating cash flow to equal $0

For our hammock-manufacturing example, we can calculate the EBITDA break-even points for the automated and manual production alternatives as follows:

In each of these calculations, we are simply dividing the fixed costs, FC, by the per-unit contribution (Price − Unit VC). The per-unit contribution is how much money is left from the sale of a single unit after all the variable costs associated with that unit have been paid. This is the amount that is available to help cover FC for the project.

per-unit contribution the dollar amount that is left over from the sale of a single unit after all the variable costs associated with that unit have been paid; this is the amount that is available to help cover FC for the project

In the hammock-manufacturing example, we see that if the automated production alternative is selected instead of the manual production alternative, almost five times as many units (3,889 versus 800 units) will have to be sold before the project breaks even on a pretax operating cash flow basis in a particular year. This is because the automated production alternative has much higher fixed costs ($35,000 versus $4,000) than the manual production alternative, but its per-unit contribution is not proportionately higher (only $9 versus $5).

Learning by Doing Application 12.4 illustrates another EBITDA break-even point calculation.

Because the pretax operating cash flow break-even points are the unit sales at which EBITDA equals $0, they are the unit sales at which the lines in Exhibit 12.4 cross the $0 point. You can see this in Exhibit 12.7, which is the same as Exhibit 12.4, except that it plots EBITDA only from 0 to 10,000 units.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 12.4
Calculating the EBITDA Break-Even Point

Problem

Calculate the expected pretax operating cash flow (EBITDA) break-even number of house calls per month for the in-home computer-support business after six months.





EXHIBIT 12.7 EBITDA Break-Even Points and Crossover Level of Unit Sales The EBITDA break-even points for the automated and manual production alternatives in the hammock-manufacturing example tell us the unit sales at which pretax operating cash flows equals $0. The crossover level of unit sales for EBITDA (COEBITDA) tells us the number of units at which the pretax operating cash flows become higher for the automated process than for the manual process.


In addition to illustrating the operating cash flow break-even points, Exhibit 12.7 shows that the automated production alternative has a larger EBITDA than the manual production alternative if sales exceed 7,750 units. This is because the larger per-unit contribution of the automated production alternative more than makes up for the higher fixed charges at this level of unit sales. We can compute the EBITDA crossover level of unit sales (CO)—the level above which the automated production alternative has higher pretax operating cash flows—as follows:

(12.5)
crossover level of unit sales (CO) the level of unit sales at which cash flows or profitability for one project alternative switches from being lower than that of another alternative to being higher

where Unit contribution stands for the per-unit contribution. The calculation for our example is as follows:

Equation 12.5 can be used to calculate the crossover level of unit sales for any two alternatives that differ in the amount of operating leverage they employ.

Accounting Operating Profit (EBIT) Break-Even
We might also be interested in determining what level of unit sales is necessary for the project to break even on operations from an accounting operating profit perspective. This is called the accounting operating profit (EBIT) break-even point. It is calculated using Equation 12.6:

accounting operating profit (EBIT) break-even point the number of units that must be sold for accounting operating profit to equal $0

(12.6)
When we calculate the accounting operating profit break-even point, we are calculating how many units must be sold to avoid an accounting operating loss. This is important to know because an accounting operating loss indicates that the project might not be able to cover its cash expenses and the wear and tear on physical assets as reflected in D&A.

For the automated production alternative in the hammock-manufacturing business, the break-even point is calculated as follows:

Similarly, for the manual production alternative:

The accounting operating profit break-even points for the automated and manual production alternatives are 5,000 and 1,000 units, respectively.

The accounting operating profit break-even points are larger than the corresponding pretax operating cash flow break-even points because in Equation 12.6 we are including the noncash D&A charges in the numerator in the calculation. Since the denominator of the fraction is the same in Equations 12.4 and 12.6, the accounting operating profit break-even points will always be larger when D&A is positive.

Learning by Doing Application 12.5 illustrates one more EBIT Break-even point calculation, and Decision Making Example 12.1 illustrates the use of break-even numbers in decision making.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 12.1
Using Break-Even Numbers

Situation

You have just finished calculating the pretax operating cash flow and accounting operating profit break-even numbers for the in-home computer-support business. These numbers are as follows:

Pretax operating cash flow break-even point: 720 house calls per year (60 per month)
Accounting operating profit break-even point: 960 house calls per year (80 per month)
You have also just heard that the national company that provides these services is going to move to the town in which you are located. This has caused you to reduce your estimate of the annual number of house calls you can expect for your business by half, from 1,440 (120 per month) to 720 (60 per month). How will this affect your decision to enter this business?

 

In addition to the accounting operating profit break-even points for two alternatives, we can also calculate the crossover level of unit sales for EBIT. The equation that we use to do this is:

(12.7)
Notice that the only difference between Equations 12.5 and 12.7 is that D&A is included in the numerator in Equation 12.7.

The calculation for our hammock-manufacturing example is as follows:

The cash flow and accounting break-even calculations are useful in helping us understand how many units must be sold to break even in a particular period of time, such as a month or a year. However, they are not comprehensive calculations in that they do not tell us what it takes for a project to break even in an economic sense—in other words, how many units must be sold over the life of a project to achieve an NPV of $0. We discuss this more comprehensive break-even analysis in the next section.

12.4 The Economic Break-Even Point
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Define the economic break-even point and be able to calculate it for a project.
Knowing the pretax operating cash flow and accounting operating profit break-even points on a year-by-year basis over the life of a project can help a financial manager ensure that sufficient cash is allocated to fund a project and to understand the impact of a project on the firm’s accounting operating profits. The economic break-even point is a more comprehensive break-even measure that can help a financial manager assess the overall economic viability of a project. This measure tells the manager how low unit sales can get before a project destroys stockholder value. It is the number of units that must be sold each year over the life of a project in order for the NPV of that project to equal $0.

economic break-even point the number of units that must be sold each year during the life of a project so that the NPV of the project equals $0

The economic break-even point is a more comprehensive measure in two main ways. First, it considers the entire life of the project, rather than a single year. Second, it focuses on the after-tax free cash flows associated with the project rather than only on the cash flows or profits from operations. Unlike the other measures, the economic break-even point accounts for both the taxes and the investments associated with a project.

We calculate the economic break-even point for a project using the following four-step procedure:

Identify the present value of the net nonrecurring investments in real assets and working capital that are required for the project (this is the present value of the initial investment plus the after-tax cash flow associated with the salvage value and the recovery of working capital at the end of the project), the life of the project, and the opportunity cost of capital for the project. Use the above information in the present value of an ordinary annuity formula (Equation 6.1) to calculate the annual incremental after-tax free cash flow (FCF), that would make the project NPV equal $0.
Use the FCF formula (Equation 11.2) to solve for the EBIT that corresponds to the FCF value calculated in Step 1. Note that this calculation requires estimates of annual depreciation and amortization (D&A), capital expenditures (Cap Exp), and additions to working capital (Add WC), as well as the firm’s marginal tax rate (t).
Add the EBIT calculated in Step 2 to the annual D&A and fixed costs (FC). This calculation gives you the annual total contribution of the project (Revenue − VC) that is associated with an NPV of $0.
Divide the annual total contribution by the unit contribution to obtain the number of units that would have to be sold annually for the project to have an NPV of $0.
To see how this four-step procedure works, let’s use it to calculate the economic break-even point for the automated production alternative for the hammock-manufacturing business.

In addition to the information previously given about the automated production alternative, we will assume that the project has a four-year life, that the initial investment is $40,000, that the salvage value is expected to equal $0, that the annual capital expenditures will equal $0, that annual additions to working capital will equal $2,000, that the firm’s marginal tax rate is 26 percent, and that the opportunity cost of capital for the project is 10 percent.

From the above assumptions, we know that the initial investment is $40,000, that no salvage value is expected, and that additions to working capital will equal $2,000 per year. If we assume that all $8,000 of the working capital ($2,000 per year × 4 years = $8,000) will be recovered at the end of the project, the present value of the net nonrecurring investments is:

In the capital budgeting calculations we discussed in Chapters 10 and 11, the NPV of a project will equal $0 when the present value of the annual FCFs from the project, PV(FCF), equals the present value of the net nonrecurring investments. If we assume, for simplicity, that the FCF will be the same each year over the four-year life of the project, we can compute the annual FCF (FCFt) at which the project will have an NPV of $0 using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. With a 10 percent discount rate, this calculation is:

Knowing that FCFt = $14,343, Cap Expt = $0, Add WCt = $2,000, D&At = $10,000 (from Exhibit 12.1), and t = 26 percent, we can use Equation 11.2 to calculate EBITt for the manufacturing alternative. Since:

solving for EBITt yields:

This is the EBIT that corresponds to the FCF at which the project NPV = $0.

We next use EBITt to calculate the amount by which revenue exceeds VC. Recall from our discussion of variable and fixed costs that:

Rearranging this formula and solving for Revenue minus VC yields:

where the FC of $35,000 is from Exhibit 12.1. The difference between Revenue and VC is the total contribution of the project. This is the amount that the project contributes to help pay its fixed costs after covering all of its variable costs.

total contribution the total amount that a project contributes to help pay its fixed costs after covering all of its variable costs

Finally, to compute the economic break-even point, we simply divide the total contribution by the per-unit contribution that we previously calculated to be $9. Doing this, we find that the economic break-even point is

This value tells us that if 5,952 units are sold each year over the life of the automated production alternative for the hammock-manufacturing business, and the unit price and cost estimates are correct, the NPV of the project will equal $0. Any unit sales above this amount will result in an economic profit—a profit that exceeds the opportunity cost of the capital invested in a project.

economic profit a profit that exceeds the opportunity cost of the capital invested in a project

To make sure we understand the economic break-even point calculation, let’s also do it for the manual production alternative for the hammock-manufacturing business.

For this calculation, we will assume that the project has a four-year life, that the initial investment is $4,000, that the salvage value is expected to equal $0, that the annual capital expenditures will equal $0, that annual additions to working capital will equal $2,000, that the firm’s marginal tax rate is 26 percent, and that the opportunity cost of capital for the project is 10 percent.


The life of the project is four years, and the opportunity cost of capital is 10 percent. Therefore the annual FCF at which the manual alternative would have an NPV of $0 is:




The number of units that must be sold in order for investors to earn the opportunity cost of capital (i.e., to achieve a $0 NPV) with the manual production alternative is substantially smaller than the number of units that must be sold if the automated production alternative is chosen (2,077 units versus 5,952 units). Of course, as we discussed earlier, the automated production alternative has the potential to generate substantially higher profits and greater value for investors with higher unit sales because it has greater operating leverage.

The opportunity cost of capital for the in-home computer support business you are starting is 8 percent, and you expect to operate the business for five years before shutting it down. Assume that the assets you acquire with the $100,000 initial investment will have no salvage value in five years and that annual capital expenditures and additions to working capital will both equal $0 in each of the next five years. In other words, the business will not require any investment beyond the initial $100,000. Finally, assume that you expect your marginal tax rate to be 20 percent over the next five years. What is the economic break-even number of house calls per year?





Before You Go On
How is the economic break-even point a more comprehensive measure of the impact of a project on a firm’s financial performance than the pretax operating cash flow break-even point or the accounting operating profit break-even point?

12.5 Risk Analysis
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Define sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and simulation analysis and describe how they are used to evaluate the risks associated with a project.
In the preceding sections, we noted that two key factors—(1) the volatility of revenue and (2) operating leverage—determine the volatility of pretax operating cash flows (EBITDA) and operating profits (EBIT) when there is no uncertainty regarding costs. We also discussed how changes in unit sales affect the volatility of EBITDA and EBIT.

Unit sales is only one of many factors that an analyst must predict when forecasting the cash flows associated with a project. As with forecasts of unit sales, forecasting the values of these other factors involves a high degree of uncertainty. For example, the price of a product depends on the supply and demand for the product, which are often difficult to predict. Similarly, future values of operating expenses, capital expenditures, and additions to working capital can be very uncertain. Financial analysts often resort to sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and simulation analysis to obtain a better understanding of how errors in forecasting these factors affect the attractiveness of a project. In other words, these analyses help answer the questions “How wrong can I be?” and “What are the implications of being wrong?”

In this section we illustrate the application of sensitivity, scenario, and simulation analysis using the automated production alternative from our hammock-manufacturing example. With expected unit sales of 10,000 per year and the other indicated assumptions, the yearly free cash flows and NPV for this alternative are calculated in Exhibit 12.8.

Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis involves examining the sensitivity of the output from an analysis, such as the NPV estimate in Exhibit 12.8, to changes in individual assumptions. In a sensitivity analysis, an analyst might examine how a project’s NPV changes if there is a decrease in the value of individual cash inflow assumptions or an increase in the value of individual cash outflow assumptions. For example, if unit sales are 10 percent lower than expected, if FC is 10 percent higher than expected, or if annual Cap Exp is 10 percent higher than expected, then an analyst could calculate that the NPV of the automated production alternative in Exhibit 12.8 declines by 32.2 percent, 12.5 percent, and 3.9 percent, respectively, when these values are changed one at a time. These numbers would tell the analyst that the NPV for the automated production alternative is much more sensitive to the unit sales assumption than to the assumptions regarding FC or Cap Exp.

sensitivity analysis examination of the sensitivity of the results from a financial analysis to changes in individual assumptions

This information is very useful because it helps the analyst identify critical assumptions. These are the assumptions the analyst should pay special attention to when evaluating the project. It does not make sense to allocate substantial analytical resources to investigating assumptions that are of little importance. In our example, the numbers suggest that the analyst should be especially careful when developing the unit sales forecasts.

Scenario Analysis
As we have just seen, sensitivity analysis is a form of “what if” analysis that is very useful in identifying key assumptions. However, the individual assumptions in a financial analysis are often related to each other; their values do not tend to change one at a time. As a result, sensitivity analysis is not very useful in examining how the attractiveness of a project might vary under different economic scenarios. An analyst who wants to examine how the results from a financial analysis will change under alternative scenarios will thus perform a scenario analysis.

Suppose, for example, that the forecasted cash flows in Exhibit 12.8 represent the performance of the automated production alternative for the hammock-manufacturing business under expected future economic conditions. Let’s consider how these cash flows might change if economic conditions turn out to be weaker or stronger than expected. In a scenario in which economic conditions are weaker than in the most likely case, we would expect unit sales to be less than 10,000 because overall demand for hammocks will be lower. The price at which the firm sells its hammocks is also likely to be lower because the firm will probably reduce prices in an effort to boost sales. On the bright side, unit variable costs might also be lower because the demand for rope, spacer bars, hardware, and so forth will decline in a weak market and producers of those products may reduce the prices they charge the firm. In contrast to the weak economic scenario, stronger economic conditions might result in higher-than-expected unit sales, prices, and unit variable costs. Exhibit 12.9 illustrates how these assumptions and the resulting project NPV might vary under the alternative scenarios.

EXHIBIT 12.9 NPV Values for the Automated Production Alternative for the Hammock-Manufacturing Business for Three Scenarios

Different economic scenarios result in different NPV estimates for the automated production alternative in the hammock-manufacturing example. The expected unit sales, unit prices, and unit variable costs vary depending on economic conditions.

Economic Conditions	Unit Sales	Unit Price	Unit Variable Costs	NPV
Strong	12,000	$28	$17	$164,076
Expected	10,000	$25	$16	  $65,557
Weak	  8,000	$22	$15	($14,197)
In Exhibit 12.9 we can see that the project will have a negative NPV if economic conditions are weak. Furthermore, the decline in NPV if economic conditions are weaker than expected ($79,754, the difference between $65,557 and negative $14,197) is less than the increase in NPV if economic conditions are stronger than expected ($98,519, the difference between $164,076 and $65,557). The range of NPV values under the three scenarios is $178,273 (the range between negative $14,197 and $164,076).

Although this analysis can help us better understand how much uncertainty is associated with an NPV estimate, it is important to remember that there is only one NPV value for a project and that the FCF values we use in an NPV analysis represent the expected incremental free cash flows. For instance, in our example, suppose there is a 50 percent chance that the most likely economic conditions will occur, a 25 percent chance that economic conditions will be weak, and a 25 percent chance that economic conditions will be strong. The NPV calculation would be based on the expected values for unit sales, the unit price, and unit variable costs.

Recall that an expected value represents the sum of the products of the possible outcomes and the probabilities that those outcomes will be realized. Therefore, the expected values for unit sales, the unit price, and unit variable costs in this example are calculated as follows:

Therefore, the NPV of the project would equal $65,557, as illustrated in Exhibit 12.8.

Simulation Analysis
Simulation analysis is like scenario analysis except that in simulation analysis an analyst uses a computer to examine a large number of scenarios in a short period of time. Rather than selecting individual values for each of the assumptions—such as unit sales, unit price, and unit variable costs—the analyst assumes that those assumptions can be represented by statistical distributions. For instance, unit sales might be assumed to have a normal distribution with a mean value of 10,000 units and a standard deviation of 1,500 units, while prices might be assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of $25 and a standard deviation of $5. A computer program then calculates the free cash flows associated with a large number of scenarios by repeatedly drawing numbers for the distributions for various assumptions, plugging them into the free cash flow model, and computing the yearly free cash flows. This technique is referred to as Monte Carlo simulation when the numbers drawn from the distributions are independent of each other across different scenarios. It is not uncommon to compute 10,000 alternative sets of free cash flows. The average of the annual free cash flows generated in this way is then computed to obtain the expected free cash flows for each year during the life of the project. These expected free cash flows can then be discounted using the opportunity cost of capital to obtain the NPV for the project.

simulation analysis an analytical method that uses a computer to quickly examine a large number of scenarios and obtain probability estimates for various values in a financial analysis

In addition to providing an estimate of the expected free cash flows, simulation analysis provides information on the distribution of the free cash flows that the project is likely to produce in each year. For example, if simulation analysis is used to compute 10,000 alternative sets of free cash flows, there will be 10,000 cash flow estimates for each year. From these estimates, an analyst can estimate the probability that the free cash flows in a given year will be greater than $0, greater than $1,000, or greater than any other number. By summing up the free cash flows over time within each alternative set of cash flows, the analyst can also estimate the probability of recovering the initial investment in the project by any particular point in the project’s life.

A discussion of the actual techniques used in simulation analysis is beyond the scope of this book. However, you should be aware that sophisticated financial analysts commonly use simulation analysis to evaluate the riskiness of projects. You are likely to see it in practice if you are ever involved with project analysis.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Explain and demonstrate how variable costs and fixed costs affect the volatility of pretax operating cash flows and accounting operating profits.

Because the fixed costs associated with a project do not change as revenue changes, when a project has fixed costs, fluctuations in revenue are magnified so that pretax operating cash flows and accounting operating profits fluctuate more than revenue in percentage terms. The greater the proportion of total costs that are fixed, the more the fluctuations in revenue will be magnified. To demonstrate this, you can perform calculations like those in the hammock-manufacturing example and in Learning by Doing Applications 12.1 and 12.2.

2 Calculate and distinguish between the degree of pretax cash flow operating leverage and the degree of accounting operating leverage.

The degree of pretax cash flow operating leverage (Cash Flow DOL) is a measure of how much pretax operating cash flow will change in relation to a change in revenue. Similarly, the degree of accounting operating leverage (Accounting DOL) is a measure of how much accounting operating profits will change in relation to a change in revenue. The only difference between cash flow operating leverage and accounting operating leverage is that the accounting measure treats incremental depreciation and amortization charges as a fixed cost in the calculation. These charges are excluded from the cash flow operating leverage measure because they do not reflect actual cash expenses and, therefore, do not affect pretax cash flows. Equations 12.2 and 12.3 are used to calculate these two measures.

3 Define and calculate the pretax operating cash flow and accounting operating profit break-even points and the crossover levels of unit sales for a project.

The pretax operating cash flow break-even point is the number of units that must be sold in a particular year to break even on a pretax operating cash flow (EBITDA) basis. It is calculated using Equation 12.4.

The accounting operating profit break-even point is the number of units that must be sold in a particular year to break even on an accounting operating profit basis. A project breaks even on an accounting operating profit basis when it produces exactly $0 in incremental operating profits (EBIT). It is calculated using Equation 12.6.

The crossover level of unit sales is the level of unit sales at which the pretax operating cash flows or accounting operating profits for one project alternative switches from being lower than that of another alternative to being higher. The EBITDA and EBIT crossover levels of unit sales are calculated using Equations 12.5 and 12.7, respectively.

4 Define the economic break-even point and be able to calculate it for a project.

The economic break-even point is the number of units that must be sold each year during the life of a project so that the NPV of the project equals $0. Section 12.4 illustrates how the economic break-even point is calculated.

5 Define sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and simulation analysis and describe how they are used to evaluate the risks associated with a project.

Sensitivity analysis is concerned with how sensitive the output from a financial analysis, such as the NPV, is to changes in an individual assumption. It helps identify which assumptions have the greatest impact on the output and, therefore, on the value of a project. Knowing this helps an analyst identify which assumptions are especially important to that analysis. Scenario analysis is used to examine how the output from a financial analysis changes under alternative scenarios. This type of analysis recognizes that changing economic and market conditions affect more than one variable at a time and tries to account for how each of the different variables will change under alternative scenarios. Simulation analysis is like scenario analysis except that in simulation analysis a computer is used to examine a large number of scenarios in a short period of time.

Self-Study Problems
12.1 The Yellow Shelf Company sells all of its shelves for $100 per shelf and incurs $50 in variable costs to produce each. If the fixed costs for the firm are $2,000,000 per year, what will the EBIT for the firm be if it produces and sells 45,000 shelves next year? Assume that depreciation and amortization are included in the fixed costs.



12.2 Hydrogen Batteries sells its specialty automobile batteries for $85 each, while its current variable cost per unit is $65. Total fixed costs (including depreciation and amortization expense) are $150,000 per year. Management expects to sell 10,000 batteries next year but is concerned that variable cost will increase next year due to material cost increases. What is the maximum variable cost per unit increase that will keep the EBIT from becoming negative?



12.3 The Vinyl CD Co. is going to take on a project that is expected to increase its EBIT by $90,000, its fixed cost cash expenditures by $100,000, and its depreciation and amortization by $80,000 next year. If the project yields an additional 10 percent in revenue, what percentage increase in the project’s EBIT will result from the additional revenue?



12.4 You are considering investing in a business that has monthly fixed costs of $5,500 and sells a single product that costs $35 per unit to make. This product sells for $90 per unit. What is the annual pretax operating cash flow break-even point for this business?



12.5 Belt Bottoms, Inc., is considering a five-year project with an initial investment of $20,000. What annual free cash flow (FCF) would be required for this project to have an NPV of $0 if the opportunity cost capital is 11 percent?



Discussion Questions
12.1 You are involved in the planning process for a firm that is expected to have a large increase in sales next year. Which type of firm would benefit more from that sales increase: a firm with low fixed costs and high variable costs or a firm with high fixed costs and low variable costs?

12.2 You own a firm with a single new product that is about to be introduced to the public for the first time. Your marketing analysis suggests that the annual demand for this product could be anywhere between 500,000 units and 5,000,000 units. Given such a wide range, discuss the safest cost structure alternative for your firm.

12.3 Discuss the interpretation of the degree of accounting operating leverage and degree of pretax cash flow operating leverage.

12.4 Explain how EBITDA differs from incremental after-tax free cash flows (FCF) and discuss the types of businesses for which this difference would be especially small or large.

12.5 Describe how the pretax operating cash flow break-even point is related to the economic break-even point.

12.6 Is it possible to have a crossover point where the accounting break-even point is the same for two alternatives—that is, above the break-even point for a low-fixed-cost alternative but below the break-even point for a high-fixed-cost alternative? Explain.

12.7 What is the fundamental difference between a sensitivity analysis and a scenario analysis?

12.8 The economic break-even calculation assumes that the number of units sold is the same each year during the life of the project. Is it possible for the NPV of a project to be negative if unit sales are not the same each year and the average unit sales are higher than those estimated using the economic break-even calculation? Explain.

12.13 EBIT: If a manufacturing firm and a service firm have identical cash fixed costs, but the manufacturing firm has much higher depreciation and amortization, then which firm is more likely to have a large discrepancy between its FCF and its EBIT?

12.14 EBIT: Duplicate Footballs, Inc., management expects to sell 15,000 balls this year. The balls sell for $110 each and have a variable cost per unit of $80. Fixed costs, including depreciation and amortization, are currently $220,000 per year. How much can either the fixed costs or the variable cost per unit increase before the company has a negative EBIT?

12.15 EBIT: Specialty Light Bulbs management anticipates selling 3,000 light bulbs this year at a price of $15 per bulb. It costs Specialty $10 in variable costs to produce each light bulb, and the fixed costs for the firm are $10,000. Specialty has an opportunity to sell an additional 1,000 bulbs next year at the same price and variable cost, but by doing so the firm will incur an additional fixed cost of $4,000. Should Specialty produce and sell the additional bulbs?

12.16 Cash Flow DOL: The pretax operating cash flow of Memphis Motors declined so much during the recession of 2008 and 2009 that the company almost defaulted on its debt. The owner of the company wants to change the cost structure of his business so that this does not happen again. He has been able to reduce fixed costs from $500,000 to $300,000 and, in doing so, reduce the Cash Flow DOL for Memphis Motors from 3.0 to 2.2 with sales of $1,000,000 and pretax operating cash flow of $250,000. If sales declined by 20 percent from this level, how much more pretax operating cash flow would Memphis Motors have with the new cost structure than under the old?

12.17 Cash Flow DOL: For the Vinyl CD Co. in Self-Study Problem 12.3, what percentage increase in pretax operating cash flow will be driven by the additional revenue?

Dandle’s Candles will be producing a new line of dripless candles in the coming year and has the choice of producing the candles in a large factory with a small number of workers or a small factory with a large number of workers. Each candle will be sold for $10. If the large factory is chosen, the cost per unit to produce each candle will be $2.50. The cost per unit will be $7.50 in the small factory. The large factory would have fixed cash costs of $2 million and a depreciation expense of $300,000 per year, while those expenses would be $500,000 and $100,000, respectively, in the small factory.

12.18 Accounting operating profit break-even: Calculate the accounting operating profit break-even point for both factory choices for Dandle’s Candles.

12.22 Economic break-even point: Management of March and Dine Inc. has estimated that the firm’s new TV dinner project must generate $10,200 in FCF during each of the next six years to have an NPV of $0. Management anticipates that depreciation and amortization charges will equal $3,000, capital expenditures will equal $2,000, and additions to working capital will equal $500 during each of those years. What level of EBIT corresponds to an annual FCF of $10,200 if the firm is subject to a 30 percent marginal tax rate?

12.23 Economic break-even point: Rose Weiser Company management is considering a project that will require an initial investment of $50,000 and will last for 10 years. No other capital expenditures or increases in working capital are anticipated during the life of the project. What is the annual EBIT that will make the project economically viable if the cost of capital for the project is 9 percent and the firm will depreciate the investment using straight-line depreciation and a salvage value of $0? Assume that the marginal tax rate is 24 percent.

12.24 Economic break-even point: The BowGus Archery Company management estimates that its new Galactically Flexible Bow project will have to generate EBIT of $20,000 each year to be viable. The project’s fixed cash expenses are expected to equal $8,000, and its depreciation and amortization expenses are expected to be $5,000 each year. If the new bows are expected to sell for $150 each and the variable cost to produce each bow is expected to be $100, then how many of these bows must the firm produce and sell each year to generate annual EBIT of $20,000?

12.25 Sensitivity and scenario analyses: Sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis are somewhat similar. Describe which is a more realistic method of analyzing the impact of different scenarios on a project.

12.26 Sensitivity analysis: Describe the circumstances under which sensitivity analysis might be a reasonable basis for determining changes to a firm’s EBIT or FCF.

12.27 Scenario analysis: Chip’s Home Brew Whiskey management forecasts that if the firm sells each bottle of Snake-Bite for $20, then the demand for the product will be 15,000 bottles per year. Sales will equal only 90 percent of this amount if the price is raised 10 percent. Chip’s variable cost per bottle is $10, and the total fixed cash cost for the year is $100,000. Depreciation and amortization charges are $20,000, and the firm has a 30 percent marginal tax rate. Management anticipates an increased working capital need of $3,000 for the year. What will be the effect of a 10 percent price increase on the firm’s FCF for the year?

12.29 Mick’s Soft Lemonade is starting to develop a new product for which the cash fixed costs are expected to be $80,000. The projected EBIT is $100,000, and the Accounting DOL is expected to be 2.0. What is the Cash Flow DOL?

12.30 If a firm has a fixed asset base, meaning that its depreciation and amortization for any year is positive, discuss the relation between its Accounting DOL and its Cash Flow DOL.

12.31 Silver Polygon, Inc. management has determined that if revenues were to increase by 10 percent, then EBIT would increase by 25 percent to $100,000. The fixed costs (cash only) for the firm are $100,000. Given the same 10 percent increase in revenues, what would be the corresponding change in EBITDA?

12.32 If a firm’s costs (both variable and fixed) are known with certainty, then what are the only two sources of volatility for the firm’s operating profits or its operating cash flows?

12.33 In most circumstances, given the choice between a higher fixed-cost structure and a lower fixed-cost structure, which of the two would generate a larger contribution margin?

12.34 Using the same logic as with the accounting break-even calculation in Problem 12.19, adapt the formula for the crossover level of unit sales to find the number of units sold where the pretax operating cash flow is the same whether the firm chooses the large or small factory.

12.35 You are the project manager for Eagle Golf Corporation. You are considering manufacturing a new golf wedge with a unique groove design. You have put together the estimates in the following table about the potential demand for the new club and the associated selling and manufacturing prices. You expect to sell the club for five years. The equipment required for the manufacturing process can be depreciated using straight-line depreciation over five years and will have a zero salvage value at the end of the project’s life. No additional capital expenditures are required. No new working capital is needed for the project. The required return for projects of this type is 12 percent, and the company has a 23 percent marginal tax rate. You estimate that there is a 50 percent chance the project will achieve good sales and a 25 percent chance it will achieve either the weak or strong sales outcomes. Should you recommend the project?

 	Strong Sales	Good Sales	Weak Sales
Units sold	    15,000	    10,000	    7,000
Selling price per unit	      $130	      $120	      $110
Variable costs per unit	        $70	        $65	        $60
Fixed costs	$258,000  	$258,000  	$258,000

12.36 You are working for Eagle Golf Corporation as described in Problem 12.35. A different equipment manufacturer is recommending its “Wedge 2100” club-making machine. The initial cost of the Wedge 2100 is $1,070,000, and the fixed costs of production will be $260,000 per year. However, because the Wedge 2100 is much more efficient than the original machine, its variable cost per unit will be $63. Assume that you will choose one of the two machines. (a) If the other financial information in Problem 12.35 applies, do you recommend the original machine or the Wedge 2100? (b) After seeing a news report that the demand for golf equipment is surging, your CFO believes that the most likely sales outcome is 15,000 units per year. Does the updated sales forecast from the CFO change your recommendation?

12.37 Commodore Motors management is considering a project to produce toy cars. The project would require an initial outlay of $100,000 and have an expected life of 10 years. Management estimates that each year during the life of the project depreciation and amortization would be $8,000, capital expenditures would be $4,000, additions to working capital would be $2,000, and fixed costs would be $3,000. Also, each toy car would sell for $15 and cost $7 to produce. Finally, the cost of capital for the project would be 12 percent, cash flow from the project would be taxed at a 25 percent rate, and the assets would be depreciated to a salvage value of $0. How many units must be sold each year in order for this project to break even from an economic standpoint?

12.39 The Fulcrum Company produces decorative swivel platforms for home televisions. If Fulcrum produces 40 million units, it estimates that it can sell them for $100 each. The variable production costs are $65 per unit. The fixed production costs, including depreciation and amortization, are $1.05 billion. Which of the following statements is true?

The Fulcrum Company produces a positive accounting operating profit (EBIT) if it produces and sells more than 25 million swivel platforms.
The Fulcrum Company’s degree of accounting operating leverage is 1.333.
If the Fulcrum Company increases production and sales by 5 percent, its operating earnings are expected to increase by 20 percent.
Increasing the fixed production costs by 10 percent will result in a lower sensitivity of operating earnings to changes in units produced and sold.
Sample Test Problems
12.1 Retro Inc. sells vintage football jerseys for $72 each. Variable costs are $58 per unit, and total fixed costs (including depreciation and amortization expense) are $84,000 per year. If sales for next year are expected to equal 8,000 jerseys, how much can variable costs per unit increase without EBIT becoming negative?

12.2 How would a capital-intensive company fare during good and poor economic times as compared with less capital-intensive companies? Explain.

12.3 The manager of Roy’s Restaurant has determined that if revenues were to increase by 20 percent, then EBIT would increase by 45 percent to $87,000. What would be the corresponding change in EBITDA if revenues increased 20 percent and cash fixed costs are $35,000?

12.4 Luminosity Inc. produces modern light fixtures that sell for $150 per unit. The firm’s management is considering purchasing a high-capacity manufacturing machine. If the high-capacity machine is purchased, then the firm’s annual cash fixed costs will be $60,000 per year, variable costs will be $55 per unit, and annual depreciation and amortization expenses will equal $30,000. If the machine is not purchased, annual cash fixed costs will be $25,000, variable costs will be $105 per unit, and annual depreciation and amortization expenses will equal $10,000. What is the minimum level of unit sales necessary in order for EBIT with the high-capacity machine to be higher than EBIT without that machine?

12.5 Paper Christmas Trees Inc. management is considering introducing a new line of inexpensive Christmas trees. The initial outlay for the project is $175,000, and the company will have to invest $5,000 in working capital and $10,000 in fixed assets each year during the six-year life of the project. The initial outlay will be depreciated assuming a salvage value of $0. Annual depreciation and amortization charges for the project will be $15,000, and cash-related fixed costs will be $6,000 per year. The firm will sell each tree for $75, and the variable cost to produce each tree will be $40. Calculate the number of trees that the firm must produce and sell in order to break even economically. Assume that the appropriate cost of capital for the project is 15 percent and that the marginal tax rate for the firm is 23 percent.

Notes
1 A hammock is a bed which is typically made of canvas or rope mesh and which is suspended by cords at each end. Hammocks are often used as garden furniture or on board ships.
2 VC equals Unit VC (or cost per unit) times the number of units sold. If we know Unit VC, we can calculate VC for different levels of unit sales.
3 We are assuming that you will cut back on advertising expenditures if revenue declines and that a modest decrease in advertising will not adversely affect demand for your services. Of course, under certain circumstances, you might actually increase advertising expenditures if demand for your service declines.
4 The term accounting operating profits is used here to refer to EBIT, even though EBIT is not actually computed using accounting numbers when we forecast cash flows for a financial analysis. The term is used to refer to the fact that noncash charges, D&A, are subtracted when computing this measure of earnings, just as is done in the calculation of accounting operating profits.

In August 2020, Tesla broke ground on its newest “gigafactory” campus, located just outside of Austin, Texas. The giant, 2,100-acre construction site will be the future home to Tesla’s second vehicle assembly plant in the United States, and its fourth production facility worldwide. The company estimated that the new venture will employ approximately 5,000 employees and be operational by 2021. Production in the new factory will initially focus on Tesla’s Model 3 compact sedan, which has become its top seller, and its Model Y compact sport utility vehicle. The company’s CEO, Elon Musk, also stated that he expects the Texas facility to serve as the launch site for two new Tesla products—the company’s planned Cybertruck pickup and its commercial semi-truck for long-haul shipping. Some analysts expected Tesla to use the Austin plant to manufacture batteries as well.

While groundbreaking on the new gigafactory represented an exciting period of new growth for Tesla, it also constituted a major capital investment for the company, with an initial estimated price tag of $1.1 billion. Before the company announced the decision to build the plant, you can be sure that the managers of Tesla carefully considered the financial aspects of the project. They evaluated the amount of capital needed to complete the project, the revenues the new plant would likely generate, and how much it would cost to operate and maintain. They also estimated what it would cost to finance the project—how much they would pay for the debt and the equity used to finance it, given the associated risks. This “cost of capital” would be incorporated into their NPV analysis of the Texas gigafactory through the discounting process.

Accurately estimating the cost of capital is especially important for a capital-intensive project such a vehicle assembly plant. If corporate managers do not account for this cost, the company can find itself investing in projects that yield cash flows that fail to compensate investors for the risk of their investment, or even have a large negative NPV. In this chapter we discuss the tools and concepts that managers use to estimate the cost of capital when they evaluate a project.

Chapter Preview
Chapter 7 discussed the general concept of risk and described what financial analysts mean when they talk about the risk associated with a project’s cash flows. It also explained how this risk is related to expected returns. With this background, we are ready to discuss the methods that financial managers use to estimate discount rates, the reasons they use these methods, and the key characteristics of each method.

We begin this chapter by introducing the weighted average cost of capital and explaining how this concept is related to the discount rates that many financial managers use to evaluate projects. Then we describe various methods that are used to estimate the costs of the three general types of financing that firms use to acquire assets—debt, common stock, and preferred stock—as well as the overall weighted average cost of capital for the firm.

We next discuss the circumstances under which it is appropriate to use the weighted average cost of capital for a firm as the discount rate for a project and outline the types of problems that can arise when the weighted average cost of capital is used inappropriately. Finally, we examine alternatives to using the weighted average cost of capital as a discount rate.

13.1 The Firm’s Overall Cost of Capital
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what the weighted average cost of capital for a firm is and why it is often used as a discount rate to evaluate projects.
Our discussions of capital budgeting up to this point have focused on evaluating individual projects. We have assumed that the rate used to discount the cash flows for a project reflects the risks associated with the incremental after-tax free cash flows from that project. In Chapter 7, we saw that unsystematic risk can be eliminated by holding a diversified portfolio. Therefore, systematic risk is the only risk that investors require compensation for bearing. With this insight, we concluded that we can use Equation 7.12 to estimate the expected rate of return for a particular investment:

where E(Ri) is the expected return on project i, Rrf is the risk-free rate of return, βi is the beta for project i, and E(Rm) is the expected return on the market. Recall that the difference between the expected return on the market and the risk-free rate [E(Rm) − Rrf] is known as the market risk premium.

Although these ideas help us better understand the discount rate on a conceptual level, they can be difficult to implement in practice. Firms do not issue publicly traded shares for individual projects. This means that analysts do not have the stock returns necessary to use a regression analysis like that illustrated in Exhibit 7.10 to estimate the beta (β) for an individual project. As a result, they have no way to directly estimate the discount rate that reflects the systematic risk of the incremental after-tax free cash flows from a particular project.

In many firms, senior financial managers deal with this problem by estimating the cost of capital for the firm as a whole and then requiring analysts within the firm to use this cost of capital to discount the free cash flows for all projects.1 A problem with this approach is that it ignores the fact that a firm is really a collection of projects with different levels of risk. A firm’s overall cost of capital is actually a weighted average of the costs of capital for these projects, where the weights reflect the relative values of the projects.

To see why a firm is a collection of projects, consider The Boeing Company. Boeing manufactures a number of different models of civilian and military aircraft. If you have ever flown on a commercial airline, chances are that you have been on a Boeing 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, or 787 aircraft. Boeing manufactures several versions of each of these aircraft models to meet the needs of its customers. These versions have different ranges, seat configurations, numbers of seats, and so on. Some are designed exclusively to haul freight for companies such as UPS and FedEx. Every version of every model of aircraft at Boeing was, at some point in time, a new project. The assets owned by Boeing today and its expected cash flows are just the sum of the assets and cash flows from all of these individual projects plus the other projects at the firm, such as those involving military aircraft.2 This means that the overall systematic risk associated with Boeing’s expected cash flows and the company’s cost of capital are weighted averages of the systematic risks and the costs of capital for its individual projects.

If the risk of an individual project differs from the average risk of the firm, the firm’s overall cost of capital is not the ideal discount rate to use when evaluating that project. Nevertheless, since this is the discount rate that is commonly used, we begin by discussing how a firm’s overall cost of capital is estimated. We then discuss alternatives to using the firm’s cost of capital as the discount rate in evaluating a project.

The Finance Balance Sheet
To understand how financial analysts estimate their firms’ costs of capital, it is helpful to be familiar with a concept that we call the finance balance sheet. The finance balance sheet was referred to as the market-value balance sheet in Chapter 3. The main difference between the finance balance sheet and the accounting balance sheet is that the finance balance sheet is based on market values rather than book values. Recall that the total book value of the assets reported on an accounting balance sheet does not necessarily reflect the total market value of those assets. This is because the book value is largely based on historical costs, while the total market value of the assets equals the present value of the total cash flows that those assets are expected to generate in the future. The market value can be greater than or less than the book value but is rarely the same.

finance balance sheet a balance sheet that is based on market values of expected cash flows

While the left-hand side of the accounting balance sheet reports the book values of a firm’s assets, the right-hand side reports how those assets were financed. Firms finance the purchase of their assets using debt and equity.3 Since the cost of the assets must equal the total value of the debt and equity that were used to purchase them, the book value of the assets must equal the book value of the liabilities plus the book value of the equity on the accounting balance sheet. In Chapter 3 we called this equality the balance sheet identity.

Just as the total book value of the assets at a firm does not generally equal the total market value of those assets, the book value of total liabilities plus stockholders’ equity does not usually equal the market value of these claims. In fact, the total market value of the debt and equity claims differs from their total book value by exactly the same amount that the total market value of a firm’s assets differs from its total book value. This is because the total market value of the debt and the equity at a firm equals the present value of the cash flows that the debt holders and the stockholders have the right to receive. These cash flows are the cash flows that the assets in the firm are expected to generate. In other words, the people who have lent money to a firm and the people who have purchased the firm’s stock have the right to receive all of the cash flows that the firm is expected to generate in the future. The value of the claims they hold must equal the value of the cash flows that they have a right to receive.

The fact that the market value of the assets must equal the value of the cash flows that these assets are expected to generate, combined with the fact that the value of the expected cash flows also equals the total market value of the firm’s total liabilities and equity, means that we can write the market value (MV) of assets as follows:

(13.1)
Equation 13.1 is just like the accounting balance sheet identity. The only difference is that Equation 13.1 is based on market values. This relation is illustrated in Exhibit 13.1.

To better understand why the market value of the assets must equal the total market value of the liabilities and equity, consider a firm whose only business is to own and manage an apartment building that was purchased 20 years ago for $1,000,000. Suppose that there is currently a $300,000 mortgage on the building, the firm has no other liabilities, and the current market value of the building, based on the expected free cash flows from future rents, is $4,000,000. What is the market value of all of the equity (stock) in this firm?

The fact that the firm paid $1,000,000 20 years ago is not relevant to this question. What matters in finance is the value of the expected free cash flows from future rents, the $4,000,000. This is the market value of the firm’s assets—the left-hand side of the balance sheet in Exhibit 13.1. Since we know that the firm owes $300,000, we can substitute into Equation 13.1 and solve for the market value of the equity:

If the free cash flows that the apartment building is expected to produce are worth $4,000,000, then investors would be willing to pay $3,700,000 for the equity in the firm. This is the value of the cash flows that they would expect to receive after making the interest and principal payments on the mortgage. Furthermore, since, by definition, the mortgage is worth $300,000, the value of the debt plus the value of the equity is $300,000 + $3,700,000 = $4,000,000—which is exactly equal to the market value of the firm’s assets.

EXHIBIT 13.1 The Finance Balance Sheet The market value of a firm’s assets, which equals the present value of the cash flows those assets are expected to generate in the future, must equal the market value of the claims on those cash flows—the firm’s liabilities and equity.


As we noted at the beginning of this discussion, the idea of a balance sheet based on market values was discussed in Chapter 3. In that chapter we pointed out that a market-value balance sheet would be more useful to financial decision makers than would the ordinary accounting balance sheet. Financial managers are much more concerned about the future than the past when they make decisions. You might revisit the discussion of sunk costs in Chapter 11 to remind yourself of why this is true.

Building Intuition
The Market Value of a Firm’s Assets Equals the Market Value of the Claims on Those Assets

The market value of the debt and equity claims against the cash flows of a firm must equal the present value of the cash flows that the firm’s assets are expected to generate. This is because, between them, the debt holders and the stockholders have the legal right to receive all of those cash flows.

Estimating a Firm’s Cost of Capital
Now that we have discussed the basic idea of the finance balance sheet, consider the challenge that financial analysts face when they want to estimate the cost of capital for a firm. If analysts at a firm could estimate the betas for each of the firm’s individual projects, they could estimate the beta for the entire firm as a weighted average of the betas for the individual projects. They could do this because, as we discussed earlier, the firm is simply a collection (portfolio) of projects. This calculation would just be an application of Equation 7.13:

where βi is the beta for project i and xi is the fraction of the total firm value represented by project i.

The analysts could then use the beta for the firm in Equation 7.12:

to estimate the expected return on the firm’s assets, which is also the firm’s cost of capital. Unfortunately, because analysts are not typically able to estimate betas for individual projects, they generally cannot use this approach.

Instead, analysts must use their knowledge of the finance balance sheet, along with the concept of market efficiency, which we discussed in Chapter 2, to estimate the cost of capital for the firm. Rather than using Equations 7.13 and 7.12 to perform the calculations for the individual projects represented on the left-hand side of the finance balance sheet, analysts perform a similar set of calculations for the different types of financing (debt and equity) on the right-hand side of the finance balance sheet. They can do this because, as we said earlier, the people who finance the firm have the right to receive all of the cash flows from the assets on the left-hand side. This means that the systematic risk associated with the total assets on the left-hand side is the same as the systematic risk associated with the total financing on the right-hand side. In other words, the weighted average of the betas for the different claims on the assets must equal a weighted average of the betas for the individual assets (projects).

Analysts do not need to estimate betas for each type of financing that the firm has. As long as they can estimate the cost of each type of financing—either directly, by observing that cost in the capital markets, or by using Equation 7.12—they can compute the cost of capital for the firm using the following equation:

(13.2)
In Equation 13.2, kFirm is the cost of capital for the firm, ki is the cost of financing type i, and xi is the fraction of the total market value of the financing (or of the assets) of the firm represented by financing type i. This formula simply says that the overall cost of capital for the firm is a weighted average of the cost of each different type of financing used by the firm.4 Note that since we are specifically talking about the cost of capital, we use the symbol ki to represent this cost, rather than the more general notation E(Ri) that we used in Chapter 7.

The similarity between Equation 13.2 and Equation 7.13 is not an accident. Both are applications of the basic idea that the systematic risk of a portfolio of assets is a weighted average of the systematic risks of the individual assets. Because Rrf and E(Rm) in Equation 7.12 are the same for all assets, when we substitute Equation 7.12 for each individual asset into Equation 13.2 (remember that E(Ri) in Equation 7.12 is the same as ki in Equation 13.2) and factor out Rrf and [E(Rm)−Rrf], we get Equation 7.13. We will not prove this here, but you might do so to convince yourself that what we are saying is true.

Building Intuition
A Firm’s Cost of Capital Is a Weighted Average of All of Its Financing Costs

The cost of capital for a firm is a weighted average of the costs of the different types of financing used by the firm. The weights are the proportions of the total firm value represented by the different types of financing. By weighting the costs of the individual financing types in this way, we obtain the overall average opportunity cost of each dollar invested in the firm.

To see how Equation 13.2 is applied, let’s return to the example of the firm whose only business is to manage an apartment building. Recall that the total value of this firm is $4,000,000 and that it has $300,000 in mortgage debt. If the firm has only one mortgage loan and one type of stock, then the fractions of the total value represented by those two types of financing are as follows:

This tells us that the value of the debt claims equals 7.5 percent of the value of the firm and that the value of the equity claims equals the remaining 92.5 percent of the value of the firm. If the cost of the debt for this business is 6 percent and the cost of the equity is 10 percent, the cost of capital for the firm can be calculated as a weighted average of the costs of the debt and equity:5

Notice that we have used Equation 13.2 to calculate a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the firm in this example. In fact, this is what people typically call the firm’s cost of capital, kFirm. From this point on, we will use the abbreviation WACC to represent the firm’s overall cost of capital.

weighted average cost of capital (WACC) the weighted average of the costs of the different types of capital (debt and equity) that have been used to finance a firm; the cost of each type of capital is weighted by the proportion of the total capital that it represents

Learning by Doing Application 13.1 illustrates another WACC calculation.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 13.1
Calculating the Cost of Capital for a Firm

Problem

You are considering purchasing a rug cleaning company that will cost $2,000,000. You plan to finance the purchase with a $1,500,000 loan from Bank of America (BofA) that has a 6.5 percent interest rate, a $300,000 loan from the seller of the company that has an 8 percent interest rate, and $200,000 of your own money. You will own all of the equity (stock) in the firm. You estimate that the opportunity cost of your $200,000 investment—that is, what you could earn on an investment of similar risk in the capital market—is 12 percent with that much debt. What is the cost of capital for this investment?

13.2 The Cost of Debt
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Calculate the cost of debt for a firm.
In our discussion of how the WACC for a firm is calculated, we assumed that the costs of the different types of financing were known. This assumption allowed us to simply plug those costs into Equation 13.2 once we had calculated the weight for each type of financing. Unfortunately, life is not that simple. In practice, analysts have to estimate each of the individual costs. In other words, the discussion in the preceding section glossed over a number of concepts and issues that you should be familiar with. This section and Section 13.3 discuss those concepts and issues and show how the costs of the different types of financing can be estimated.

Before we move on to the specifics of how to estimate the costs of different types of financing, we must stress an important point: All of these calculations depend in some part on financial markets being efficient. We suggested this in the last section when we mentioned that analysts have to rely on the concept of market efficiency to estimate the WACC. The reason is that analysts often cannot directly observe the rate of return that investors require for a particular type of financing. Instead, analysts must rely on the security prices they can observe in the financial markets to estimate the required rate.

It makes sense to rely on security prices only if you believe that the financial markets are reasonably efficient at incorporating new information into these prices. If the markets were not efficient, estimates of expected returns that were based on market security prices would be unreliable. Of course, if the returns that are plugged into Equation 13.2 are bad, the resulting estimate for WACC will also be bad. With this caveat, we can now discuss how to estimate the costs of the various types of financing.

Key Concepts for Estimating the Cost of Debt
Virtually all firms use some form of debt financing. The financial managers at firms typically arrange for revolving lines of credit to finance working capital items such as inventories or accounts receivable. These lines of credit are very much like the lines of credit that come with your credit cards. Firms also obtain private fixed-term loans, such as bank loans, or sell bonds to the public to finance ongoing operations or the purchase of long-term assets—just as you would finance your living expenses while you are in school with a student loan or a car with a car loan. For example, an energy firm, such as Next Era Energy Resources in Florida, will sell bonds to finance a new power plant, and a retailer, such as Target, will use debt to finance new stores and distribution centers. As mentioned earlier, we will discuss how firms finance themselves in more detail in Chapters 15 and 16, but for now it is sufficient to recognize that firms use these three general types of debt financing: lines of credit, private fixed-term loans, and bonds that are sold in the public markets.

There is a cost associated with each type of debt that a firm uses. However, when we estimate the cost of capital for a firm, we are particularly interested in the cost of the firm’s long-term debt. Firms generally use long-term debt to finance their long-term assets, and it is the long-term assets that concern us when we think about the value of a firm’s assets. By long-term debt, we usually mean the debt that, when it was borrowed, was set to mature in more than one year. This typically includes fixed-term bank loans used to finance ongoing operations or long-term assets, as well as the bonds that a firm sells in the public debt markets.

Although one year is not an especially long time, debt with a maturity of more than one year is typically viewed as permanent debt. This is because firms often borrow the money to pay off this debt when it matures. Doing this replaces maturing debt with new debt, thereby leaving the amount of debt at the firm unchanged.

We do not normally worry about revolving lines of credit when calculating the cost of debt because the balances on these lines tend to be temporary. Banks typically require that the outstanding balances be periodically paid down to $0 (just as individuals pay their entire credit card balance from time to time).

When analysts estimate the cost of a firm’s long-term debt, they are estimating the cost on a particular date—the date on which they are doing the analysis. This is a very important point to keep in mind because the interest rate that the firm is paying on its outstanding debt does not necessarily reflect its current cost of debt. Interest rates change over time, and so does the cost of debt for a firm. The rate a firm was charged three years ago for a five-year loan is unlikely to be the same rate that it would be charged today for a new five-year loan. For example, suppose that Next Era Energy Resources issued bonds five years ago for 7 percent. Since then, interest rates have fallen, so the same bonds could be sold at par value today for 6 percent. The cost of debt today is 6 percent, not 7 percent, and 6 percent is the cost of debt that management will use in WACC calculations. If you looked in the firm’s financial statements, you would see that the firm is paying an interest rate of 7 percent. This is what the financial managers of the firm agreed to pay five years ago, not what it would cost to sell the same bonds today. The accounting statements reflect the cost of debt that was sold at some time in the past.

Building Intuition
The Current Cost of Long-Term Debt Is What Matters When Calculating WACC

The current cost of long-term debt is the appropriate cost of debt for WACC calculations. This is because the WACC we use in capital budgeting is the opportunity cost of capital for the firm’s investors as of today. Thus, we must use today’s costs of debt and equity when we calculate the WACC. Historical costs should not be used for WACC calculations.

Estimating the Current Cost of a Bond or an Outstanding Loan
We have now seen that we should not use historical costs of debt in WACC calculations. Let’s discuss how we can estimate the current costs of bonds and other fixed-term loans by using market information.

The Current Cost of a Bond

You may not realize it, but we have already discussed how to estimate the current cost of debt for a publicly traded bond. This cost is estimated using the yield to maturity calculation. Recall that in Chapter 8 we defined the yield to maturity as the discount rate that makes the present value of the coupon and principal payments equal to the price of the bond.

For example, consider a 10-year bond with a $1,000 face value that was issued five years ago. This bond has five years remaining before it matures. If the bond has an annual coupon rate of 7 percent, pays coupon interest semiannually, and is currently selling for $1,042.65, we can calculate its yield to maturity by using Equation 8.1 and solving for i or by using a financial calculator. Let’s use Equation 8.1 for this example.

To do this, as was discussed in the section on semiannual compounding in Chapter 8, we first convert the bond data to reflect semiannual compounding: (1) the total number of coupon payments is 10 (2 payments per year × 5 years = 10 payments), and (2) the semiannual coupon payment is $35 [($1,000 × 7 percent per year)/2 periods per year = $70/2 = $35]. We can now use Equation 8.1 and solve for i to find the yield to maturity:

By trial and error or with a financial calculator, we solve for i and find:

This semiannual rate would be quoted as an annual rate of 6 percent (2 periods per year × 0.03 per period = 0.06, or 6 percent) in financial markets. However, as explained in Chapter 8, this annual rate fails to account for the effects of compounding. We must therefore use Equation 6.7 to calculate the effective annual interest rate (EAR) in order to obtain the actual current annual cost of this debt:

If this bond was sold at par value, it paid 7 percent when it was issued five years ago. Someone who buys it today will expect to earn only 6.09 percent per year. This is the annual rate of return required by the market on this bond, which is known as the effective annual yield.

Notice that the above calculation takes into account the interest payments, the face value of the debt (the amount that will be repaid in five years), and the current price at which the bond is selling. It is necessary to account for all of these characteristics of the bond. The return received by someone who buys the bond today will be determined by both the interest income and the capital appreciation (or capital depreciation in this case, since the price is higher than the face value).

We must account for one other factor when we calculate the current cost of bond financing to a company—the cost of issuing the bond. In the above example, we calculated the return that someone who buys the bond can expect to receive. Since a company must pay fees to investment bankers, lawyers, and accountants, along with various other costs, to actually issue a bond, the cost to the company is higher than 6.09 percent.6 Therefore, in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the cost of a bond to the issuing firm, analysts must incorporate issuance costs into their calculations. Issuance costs are an example of direct out-of-pocket costs, the actual out-of-pocket costs that a firm incurs when it raises capital.

The way in which issuance costs are incorporated into the calculation of the cost of a bond is straightforward. Analysts use the net proceeds that the company receives from the bond, rather than the price that is paid by the investor, on the left-hand side of Equation 8.1. Suppose the company in our example sold five-year bonds with a 7 percent coupon today and paid issuance costs equal to 2 percent of the total value of the bonds. After paying the issuance costs, the company would receive only 98 percent of the price paid by the investors. Therefore, the company would actually receive only $1,042.65 × (1 − 0.02) = $1,021.80 for each bond it sold, and the semiannual cost to the company would be:

Converting the adjusted semiannual rate to an EAR, we see that the actual annual cost of this debt financing is:

In this example the issuance costs increase the effective cost of the bonds from 6.09 percent to 6.58 percent per year.

The Current Cost of an Outstanding Loan

Conceptually, calculating the current cost of long-term bank or other private debt is not as straightforward as estimating the current cost of a public bond, because financial analysts cannot observe the market price of private debt. Fortunately, analysts do not typically have to do this. Instead, they can simply call their banker and ask what rate the bank would charge if they decided to refinance the debt today. A rate quote provides a good estimate of the current cost of a private loan.

Taxes and the Cost of Debt
It is very important that you understand one additional concept concerning the cost of debt: In the United States, firms can deduct interest payments for tax purposes. In other words, every dollar a firm pays in interest reduces the firm’s taxable income by one dollar. Thus, if the firm’s marginal tax rate is 25 percent, the firm’s total tax bill will be reduced by 25 cents for every dollar of interest it pays. A dollar of interest would actually cost this firm only 75 cents because the firm would save 25 cents on its taxes.

More generally, the after-tax cost of interest payments equals the pretax cost times 1 minus the tax rate. This means that the after-tax cost of debt is:

(13.3)
This after-tax cost of debt is the cost that firms actually use to calculate the WACC. The reason is that investors care only about the after-tax cost of capital—just as they care only about after-tax cash flows. Managers are concerned about what they actually have to pay for capital, and the actual cost is reduced if the government subsidizes debt by providing a tax break.

Taxes affect the cost of debt in much the same way that the interest tax deduction on a home mortgage affects the cost of financing a house. For example, assume that you borrow $200,000 at 6 percent to buy a house on January 1 and your interest payments total $12,000 in the first year. Under the tax law, you can deduct this $12,000 from your taxable income when you calculate your taxes for the year.7

Suppose that your taxable income before the interest deduction is $75,000 and, for simplicity, that both your average and marginal tax rates are 20 percent. Without the mortgage interest deduction, you would pay taxes totaling $15,000 ($75,000 × 0.20 = $15,000). However, because the interest payments reduce your taxable income, your taxes with the interest deduction will be only $12,600 [($75,000 − $12,000) × 0.20 = $12,600]. The ability to deduct the interest payments you made saved you $2,400 ($15,000 − $12,600 = $2,400)! This savings is exactly equal to the interest payment you make times your marginal tax rate: $12,000 × 0.20 = $2,400. Since you are saving $2,400, the after-tax cost of your interest payments is $9,600 ($12,000 − $2,400 = $9,600), which means that the after-tax cost of this debt is 4.80 percent ($9,600/$200,000 = 0.0480, or 4.80 percent). This is exactly what Equation 13.3 tells us. With kDebt pretax at 6 percent and t at 20 percent, Equation 13.3 gives us:

Estimating the Cost of Debt for a Firm
Most firms have several different debt issues outstanding at any particular point in time. Just as you might have both a car loan and a school loan, a firm might have several bank loans and bond issues outstanding. To estimate the firm’s overall cost of debt when it has several debt issues outstanding, we must first estimate the costs of the individual debt issues and then calculate a weighted average of these costs.

To see how this is done, let’s consider an example. Suppose that your pizza parlor business has grown dramatically in the past three years from a single restaurant to 30 restaurants. To finance this growth, two years ago you sold $25 million of five-year bonds. These bonds pay interest annually and have a coupon rate of 8 percent. They are currently selling for $1,026.24 per $1,000 bond. Just today, you also borrowed $5 million from your local bank at an interest rate of 6 percent. Assume that this is all the long-term debt that you have and that there are no issuance costs. What is the overall average after-tax cost of your debt if your business’s marginal tax rate is 25 percent?

The pretax cost of the bonds as of today is the effective annual yield on those bonds. Since the bonds were sold two years ago, they will mature three years from now. Using Equation 8.1, we find that the effective annual yield (which equals the yield to maturity in this example) for these bonds is:

The pretax cost of the bank loan that you took out today is simply the 6 percent rate that the bank is charging you, assuming that the bank is charging you the market rate.

Now that we know the pretax costs of the two types of debt that your business has outstanding, we can calculate the overall average cost of your debt by calculating the weighted average of their two costs. Since the weights for the two types of debt are based on their current market values, we must first determine these values. Because the bonds are currently selling above their par value, we know that their current market value is greater than their $25 million face value. In fact, it equals:

Since the bank loan was just made today, its value simply equals the amount borrowed, or $5 million. The weights for the two types of debt are therefore:

The weighted average pretax cost of debt is:

The after-tax cost of debt is therefore:

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 13.2
Calculating the After-Tax Cost of Debt for a Firm

Problem

You have just successfully completed a leveraged buyout of the firm that you have been working for. To finance this $35 million transaction, you and three partners put up a total of $10 million in equity capital, and you borrowed $25 million from banks and other investors. The bank debt consists of $10 million of secured debt borrowed at a rate of 6 percent from Bank of America and $7 million of senior unsecured debt borrowed at a rate of 7 percent from JPMorgan Chase. The remaining $8 million was borrowed from an investment group managed by a private equity firm. The rate on this subordinated (junior) unsecured debt is 9.5 percent. What is the overall after-tax cost of the debt financing used to buy the firm if you expect the firm’s average and marginal tax rates to be 25 percent each?





DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 13.1
Using the Cost of Debt in Decision Making

Situation

Your pizza parlor business has developed such a strong reputation that you have decided to take advantage of the restaurant’s name recognition by selling frozen pizzas through grocery stores. In order to do this, you will have to build a manufacturing facility. You estimate that this will cost you $10 million. Since your business currently has only $2 million in the bank, you will have to borrow the remaining $8 million. You have spoken with two bankers about possible loan packages. The banker from Easy Money Financial Services offered you a loan for $6 million with a 6 percent rate and $2 million with a 7.5 percent rate. You calculate the pretax cost of debt for this package to be:

Your local banker offered you a single $8 million loan for 6.35 percent. Which financing should you choose if all terms on all of the loans, other than the interest rates, are the same?

13.3 The Cost of Equity
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Calculate the cost of common stock and the cost of preferred stock for a firm.
The cost of equity (stock) for a firm is a weighted average of the costs of the different types of stock that the firm has outstanding at a particular point in time. We saw in Chapter 9 that some firms have both preferred stock and common stock outstanding. In order to calculate the cost of equity for these firms, we have to know how to calculate the cost of both common stock and preferred stock. In this section, we discuss how financial analysts can estimate the costs associated with these two different types of stock.

Common Stock
Just as information about market rates of return is used to estimate the cost of debt, market information is also used to estimate the cost of equity. There are several ways to do this. The particular approach a financial analyst chooses will depend on what information is available and how reliable the analyst believes it is. In this section we discuss three alternative methods for estimating the cost of common equity (stock). It is important to remember throughout this discussion that the “cost” we are referring to is the rate of return that investors require for investing in the stock at a particular point in time, given its systematic risk.

Method 1: Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The first method for estimating the cost of common equity is one that we discussed in Chapter 7. This method uses Equation 7.12:

In this equation, the expected return on an asset is a linear function of the systematic risk associated with that asset as measured by beta.

If we recognize that E(Ri) in Equation 7.12 is the cost of the common stock (equity) used to finance the firm (kcs) when we are calculating the cost of common equity and that [E(Rm) − Rrf] is the market risk premium, we can rewrite Equation 7.12 as follows:

(13.4)
Equation 13.4 is just another way of writing Equation 7.12. It tells us that the cost of common stock equals the risk-free rate of return plus compensation for the systematic risk associated with the common stock. You already saw some examples of how to use this equation to calculate the cost of equity in the discussion of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) in Chapter 7. In those examples you were given the current risk-free rate, the beta for the stock, and the market risk premium and were asked to calculate kcs using the equation. Now we turn our attention to some practical considerations that you must be concerned with when choosing the appropriate risk-free rate, beta, and market risk premium for this calculation.

The Risk-Free Rate
First, let’s consider the risk-free rate. The current effective annual yield on a risk-free asset should always be used in Equation 13.4.8 This is because the risk-free rate at a particular point in time reflects the rate of inflation that the market expects in the future. Since the expected rate of inflation changes over time, an old risk-free rate might not reflect current inflation expectations.

When analysts select a risk-free rate, they must choose between using a short-term rate, such as that for Treasury bills, or a longer-term rate, such as that for Treasury notes or bonds. Which of these choices is more appropriate? This question has been hotly debated by finance professionals for many years. We recommend that you use the risk-free rate on a long-term Treasury security when you estimate the cost of equity capital because the equity claim is a long-term claim on the firm’s cash flows. As you saw in Chapter 9, the stockholders have a claim on the cash flows of the firm in perpetuity. By using a long-term Treasury security, you are matching a long-term risk-free rate with a long-term claim. A long-term risk-free rate better reflects long-term inflation expectations and the cost of getting investors to part with their money for a long period of time than does a short-term rate.

The Beta
If the common stock of a company is publicly traded, then you can estimate the beta for that stock using a regression analysis similar to that illustrated in Exhibit 7.10. It is also quite easy to obtain estimated betas from any number of financial Web sites, such as CNBC and Yahoo! Finance. Identifying the appropriate beta is much more complicated if the common stock is not publicly traded. Since most companies in the United States are privately owned and do not have publicly traded stock, this is a problem that arises quite often when someone wants to estimate the cost of common equity for a firm.

Financial analysts often overcome this problem by identifying a “comparable” company with publicly traded stock that is in the same line of business and that has a similar amount of debt. For example, suppose you are trying to estimate the beta for your pizza business. The company has now grown to include more than 2,000 restaurants throughout the world. The frozen-foods business, however, was never successful and had to be shut down. You know that Domino’s Pizza, Inc., one of your major competitors, has publicly traded equity and that the proportion of debt to equity for Domino’s is similar to the proportion for your firm. Since Domino’s overall business is similar to yours, in that it is only in the pizza business and competes in similar geographic areas, it would be reasonable to consider Domino’s a comparable company.

The systematic risk associated with the stock of a comparable company is likely to be similar to the systematic risk for the stock of the private firm because a stock’s systematic risk is determined by the nature of the firm’s business and the amount of debt that it uses. If you are able to identify a good comparable company, such as Domino’s Pizza, you can use its beta in Equation 13.4 to estimate the cost of equity capital for your firm. Even when a good comparable company cannot be identified, it is sometimes possible to use an average of the betas for the public firms in the same industry.

The Market Risk Premium
It is not possible to directly observe the market risk premium. We just do not know what rate of return investors expect for the market portfolio, E(Rm), at a particular point in time. Therefore, we cannot simply calculate the market risk premium as the difference between the expected return on the market and the risk-free rate, [E(Rm) − Rrf]. For this reason, financial analysts generally use a measure of the average risk premium investors have actually earned in the past as an indication of the risk premium they might require today.

For example, from 1926 through the end of 2019, actual returns on the U.S. stock market exceeded actual returns on long-term U.S. government bonds by an average of 6.11 percent per year (12.09 percent − 5.98 percent = 6.11 percent from Exhibit 7.3). If, on average, investors earned the risk premium that they expected, this figure reflects the average market risk premium over the period from 1926 to 2019. If a financial analyst believes that the market risk premium in the past is a reasonable estimate of the risk premium today, then he or she might use 6.11 percent as the market risk premium in Equation 13.4. Financial analysts’ estimates of the market risk premium can vary over time and with different measures of the market return. In this case we relied on the average return to large company stocks. In practice, we often see estimates of the market risk premium vary from a low of 5 percent up to 8 percent.

With this background, let’s work an example to illustrate how Equation 13.4 is used to estimate the cost of common stock for a firm. Suppose that it is December 29, 2020, and we want to estimate the cost of the common stock for the oil company ConocoPhillips. Using yields reported by the Wall Street Journal on that day, we determine that one-year Treasury bills have an effective annual yield of 0.087 percent and that 30-year Treasury bonds have an effective annual yield of 1.678 percent. From the Yahoo! Finance Web site (www.finance.yahoo.com), we find that the beta for ConocoPhillips stock is 1.87. We know that the market risk premium averaged 6.11 percent from 1926 to 2019. What is the expected rate of return on ConocoPhillips common stock?

Since we are estimating the expected rate of return on common stock, and common stock is a long-term asset, we use the long-term Treasury bond yield of 1.678 percent in the calculation. Notice that the Treasury bill and Treasury bond rates differed by 1.591 percent (1.678 percent − 0.087 percent = 1.591 percent) on December 29, 2020. They often differ by this amount or more, so the choice of which rate to use can make quite a difference in the estimated cost of equity.

Once we have selected the appropriate risk-free rate, we can plug it, along with the beta and market risk premium values, into Equation 13.4 to calculate the cost of common stock for ConocoPhillips:

This example illustrates how Equation 13.4 is used to estimate the cost of common stock for a company. How would the analysis differ for a private company? The only difference is that we would not be able to estimate the beta directly. We would have to estimate the beta using betas for similar public companies.

Learning by Doing Application 13.3 shows another example of the calculation of a firm’s cost of common stock.

Method 2: Using the Constant-Growth Dividend Model

In Chapter 9 we noted that if the dividends received by the owner of a share of common stock are expected to grow at a constant rate in perpetuity, then the value of that share today can be calculated using Equation 9.4:

where D1 is the dividend expected to be paid one period from today, R is the required rate of return, and g is the annual rate at which the dividends are expected to grow in perpetuity.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 13.3
Calculating the Cost of Common Stock Using a Stock’s Beta

Problem

You have decided to estimate the cost of the common stock in your pizza business on December 29, 2020. As noted earlier, the risk-free rate and the market risk premium on that day were 1.678 percent and 6.11 percent, respectively. Since you have already decided that Domino’s Pizza is a reasonably comparable company, you obtain Domino’s beta from the Yahoo! Finance Web site (www.finance.yahoo.com). This beta is 0.39. What do you estimate the cost of common stock in your pizza business to be?





We can replace the R in Equation 9.4 with kcs since we are specifically estimating the expected rate of return for investing in common stock (also the cost of equity if the firm has no other types of stock outstanding). We can then rearrange this equation to solve for kcs:

(13.5)
While Equation 13.5 is just a variation of Equation 9.4, it is important enough to identify as a separate equation because it provides a direct way of estimating the cost of equity under certain circumstances. If we can estimate the dividend that stockholders will receive next period, D1, and we can estimate the rate at which the market expects dividends to grow over the long run, g, then we can use today’s market price, P0, in Equation 13.5 to tell us what rate of return investors in the firm’s common stock are expecting to earn.

Consider an example. Suppose that the current price for the common stock at Sprigg Lane Company is $20, that the firm is expected to pay a dividend of $2 per share to its common stockholders next year, and that the dividend is expected to grow at a rate of 3 percent in perpetuity after next year. Equation 13.5 tells us that the required rate of return for Sprigg Lane’s stock is:

This approach can be useful for a firm that pays dividends when it is reasonable to assume dividends will grow at a constant rate and when the analyst has a good idea what that growth rate will be. An electric utility firm is an example of this type of firm. Some electric utility firms pay relatively high and predictable dividends that increase at a fairly consistent rate. In contrast, this approach would not be appropriate for use by a high-tech firm that pays no dividends or that pays a small dividend that is likely to increase at a high rate in the short run. Equation 13.5, like any other equation, should be used only if it is appropriate for the particular stock.

You might be asking yourself at this point where you would get P0, D1, and g in order to use Equation 13.5 for a particular stock. You can get the current price of a share of stock as well as the dividend that a firm is expected to pay next year quite easily from many different Web sites—for example, CNBC and Yahoo! Finance. The financial information includes the dollar value of dividends paid in the past year and the dividend that the firm is expected to pay in the next year.

Estimating the long-term rate of growth in dividends is more difficult, but there are some guidelines that can help. As we discussed in Chapter 9, the first rule is that dividends cannot grow faster than the long-term growth rate of the economy in a perpetuity model such as Equation 9.4 or 13.5. Assuming dividends will grow faster than the economy is the same as assuming that dividends will eventually become larger than the economy itself! We know this is impossible.

What is the long-term growth rate of the economy? Well, historically it has been the rate of inflation plus about 3 percent. This means that if inflation is expected to be 3 percent in the long run, then a reasonable estimate for the long-term growth rate in the economy is 6 percent (3 percent inflation + 3 percent real growth = 6 percent). This tells us that g in Equation 13.5 will not be greater than 6 percent. What exactly it will be depends on the nature of the business and the industry it is in. If it is a declining industry, then g might be negative. If the industry is expected to grow with the economy and the particular firm you are evaluating is expected to retain its market share, then a reasonable estimate for g might be 5 or 6 percent.

Method 3: Using a Multistage-Growth Dividend Model

Using a multistage-growth dividend model to estimate the cost of equity for a firm is very similar to using a constant-growth dividend model. The difference is that a multistage-growth dividend model allows for faster dividend growth rates in the near term, followed by a constant long-term growth rate. If this concept sounds familiar, that is because it is the idea behind the mixed (supernormal) growth dividend model discussed in Chapter 9. In Equation 9.6, this model was written as:

multistage-growth dividend model a model that allows for varying dividend growth rates in the near term, followed by a constant long-term growth rate; another term used to describe the mixed (supernormal) growth dividend model discussed in Chapter 9

where Di is the dividend in period i, Pt is the value of constant-growth dividend payments in period t, and R is the required rate of return.

To refresh your memory of how this model works, let’s consider a three-stage example. Suppose that a firm will pay a dividend one year from today (D1) and that this dividend will increase at a rate of g1 the following year, g2 the year after that, and g3 per year thereafter. The value of a share of this stock today thus equals:

In this equation, we have replaced the R in Equation 9.6 with kcs since we are specifically estimating the expected rate of return for common stock. We have also written all of the dividends in terms of D1 to illustrate how the different growth rates will affect the dividends in each year. Finally, we have written Pt in terms of the constant-growth model. If we substitute D1, D2, D3, and D4 where appropriate, you can see that this is really just Equation 9.6, where we have replaced R with kcs and written Pt in terms of the constant-growth model:

All this equation does is add the present values of the dividends that are expected in each of the next three years and the present value of a growing perpetuity that begins in the fourth year. Exhibit 13.2 illustrates how cash flows relate to the four terms in the equation.

Note that the fourth term in Exhibit 13.2 is discounted only three years because, as we saw in Chapters 6 and 9, the constant-growth model gives you the present value of a growing perpetuity as of the year before the first cash flow. In this case, since the first cash flow is D4, the model gives you the value of the growing perpetuity as of Year 3.

A multistage-growth dividend model is much more flexible than the constant-growth dividend model because we do not have to assume that dividends grow at the same rate forever. We can use a model such as this to estimate the cost of common stock, kcs, by plugging P0, D1, and the appropriate growth rates into the model and solving for kcs using trial and error—just as we solved for the yield to maturity of bonds in Chapter 8 and earlier in this chapter. Alternatively, we can solve these problems using a spreadsheet. The major issues we have to be concerned about when we use a multistage-growth dividend model are (1) that we have chosen the right model, meaning that we have included enough stages or growth rates, and (2) that our estimates of the growth rates are reasonable.

EXHIBIT 13.2 The Three-Stage Dividend Growth Equation In the three-stage dividend growth equation shown here, the price of a share of stock is equal to the present value of dividends expected to be received at the end of Years 1, 2, and 3, plus the present value of a growing perpetuity that begins in Year 4 and whose dividends are assumed to grow at a constant rate g3 forever.


Let’s work an example to illustrate how this model is used to calculate the cost of common stock. Suppose that we want to estimate the cost of common stock for a firm that is expected to pay a dividend of $1.50 per share next year. This dividend is expected to increase 15 percent the following year, 10 percent the year after that, 7 percent the year after that, and 5 percent annually thereafter. If the firm’s common stock is currently selling for $24 per share, what is the rate of return that investors require for investing in this stock?

Because there are four different growth rates in this example, we have to solve a formula with five terms:

From the information given in the problem statement, we know the following:

Substituting these values into the above equation gives us the following, which we solve for kcs:

Using Excel
Solving for kcs Using a Multistage-Growth Dividend Model

Because trial-and-error calculations can be somewhat tedious when you perform them by hand, you may find it helpful to use a spreadsheet. If you would like to use a spreadsheet to solve the preceding problem yourself, the output from the spreadsheet below shows you how to do it using trial and error.

Once you input the indicated numbers and formulas into cells B3 through B14, you can then vary the number in cell B2 until the number in cell B8 equals $24. Once you have built the model, you can also use the “goal seek” or “solver” functions in Excel to avoid having to manually solve the problem by trial and error. See the “Help” feature in Excel for information on how to use these functions.


As mentioned earlier, we can solve this equation for kcs using trial and error. When we do this, we find that kcs is 12.20 percent. This is the rate of return at which the present value of the cash flows equals $24. Therefore, it is the rate that investors currently require for investing in this stock.

The Using Excel Example illustrates how an Excel spreadsheet can make it easier to solve trial-and-error problems.

Which Method Should We Use?

We now have discussed three methods of estimating the cost of common equity for a firm. You might be asking yourself how you are supposed to know which method to use. The short answer is that, in practice, most people use the CAPM (Method 1) to estimate the cost of common equity if the result is going to be used in the discount rate for evaluating a project. One reason is that, assuming the theory is valid, CAPM tells managers what rate of return investors should require for equity having the same level of systematic risk that the firm’s equity has. This is the appropriate opportunity cost of equity capital for an NPV analysis if the project has the same risk as the firm and will have similar leverage. Furthermore, CAPM does not require financial analysts to make assumptions about future growth rates in dividends, as Methods 2 and 3 do.

Used properly, Methods 2 and 3 provide an estimate of the rate of return that is implied by the current price of a firm’s stock at a particular point in time. If the stock markets are efficient, then this should be the same as the number that we would estimate using CAPM. However, to the extent that the firm’s stock is mispriced—for example, because investors are not informed or have misinterpreted the future prospects for the firm—deriving the cost of equity from the price at one point in time can yield a bad estimate of the true cost of equity.

Preferred Stock
As we discussed in Chapter 9, preferred stock is a form of equity that has a stated value and specified dividend rate. For example, a share of preferred stock might have a stated value of $100 and a 5 percent dividend rate. The owner of such a share would be entitled to receive a dividend of $5 ($100 × 0.05 = $5) each year. Another key feature of preferred stock is that it does not have an expiration date. In other words, preferred stock continues to pay the specified dividend in perpetuity, unless the firm repurchases it or goes out of business.

These characteristics of preferred stock allow us to use the perpetuity model, Equation 6.4, to estimate the cost of preferred equity. For example, suppose that investors would pay $85 for a share of the preferred stock mentioned above. We can rewrite Equation 6.4:

as:

where Pps is the present value of the expected dividends (the current preferred stock price), Dps is the annual preferred stock dividend, and kps is the cost of the preferred stock. Rearranging the formula to solve for kps yields:

(13.6)
Plugging the information from our example into Equation 13.6, we see that kps for the preferred stock in our example is:

This is the rate of return at which the present value of the annual $5 cash flows equals the market price of $85. Therefore, 5.88 percent is the rate that investors currently require for investing in this preferred stock.

It is easy to incorporate issuance costs into the above calculation to obtain the cost of the preferred stock to the firm that issues it. As in the earlier bond calculations, we use the net proceeds from the sale rather than the price that is paid by the investor in the calculation. For example, suppose that in order for a firm to sell the above preferred stock, it must pay an investment banker 5 percent of the amount of money raised. If there are no other issuance costs, the company would receive $85 × (1 − 0.05) = $80.75 for each share sold, and the total cost of this financing to the firm would be:

You may recall from the discussion in Chapter 9 that certain characteristics of preferred stock look a lot like those of debt. The equation Pps = Dps/kps shows that the value of preferred stock also varies with market rates of return in the same way as debt. Because kps is in the denominator of the fraction on the right-hand side of the equation, whenever kps increases, Pps decreases, and whenever kps decreases, Pps increases. That is, the value of preferred stock is negatively related to market rates.

It is also important to recognize that the CAPM can be used to estimate the cost of preferred equity, just as it can be used to estimate the cost of common equity. A financial analyst can simply substitute kps for kcs and βps for βcs in Equation 13.4 and use it to estimate the cost of preferred stock. Remember from Chapter 7 that the CAPM does not apply only to common stock; rather, it applies to any asset. Therefore, we can use it to calculate the rate of return on any asset if we can estimate the beta for that asset.

Learning by Doing Application 13.4 illustrates another calculation of the cost of preferred stock.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 13.4
Estimating the Cost of Preferred Stock

Problem

You work in the treasury department at Wells Fargo & Company, and your manager has asked you to estimate the cost of each of the different types of stock that Wells Fargo has outstanding. One of these issues is an 8 percent noncumulative preferred stock that has a stated value of $1,000 and is currently selling for $927.90. Although this preferred stock is publicly traded, it does not trade very often. This means that you cannot use the CAPM to estimate kps because you cannot get a good estimate of the beta using regression analysis. How else can you estimate the cost of this preferred stock, and what is this cost?

13.4 Using the WACC in Practice
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Calculate the weighted average cost of capital for a firm, explain the limitations of using a firm’s weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate when evaluating a project, and discuss the alternatives to the firm’s weighted average cost of capital.
We have now covered the basic concepts and computational tools that are used to estimate the WACC. At this point, we are ready to talk about some of the practical issues that arise when financial analysts calculate the WACC for their firms.

When financial analysts think about calculating the WACC, they usually think of it as a weighted average of the firm’s after-tax cost of debt, cost of preferred stock, and cost of common equity. Equation 13.2 is usually written as:

(13.7)
where xDebt + xps + xcs = 1. If the firm has more than one type of debt outstanding or more than one type of preferred or common stock, analysts will calculate a weighted average for each of those types of securities and then plug those averages into Equation 13.7. Financial analysts will also use the market values, rather than the accounting book values, of the debt, preferred stock, and common stock to calculate the weights (the x’s) in Equation 13.7. This is because, as we have already seen, the theory underlying the discounting process requires that the costs of the different types of financing be weighted by their relative market values. Accounting book values should not be used in these calculations.

Calculating WACC: An Example
An example provides a useful way of illustrating how the theories and tools that we have discussed are used in practice. Assume that you are a financial analyst at a manufacturing company that has used three types of debt, preferred stock, and common stock to finance its investments.

Debt The debt includes a $4 million bank loan that is secured by machinery and equipment. This loan has an interest rate of 6 percent, and your firm could expect to pay the same rate if the loan were refinanced today. Your firm also has a second bank loan (a $3 million mortgage on your manufacturing plant) with an interest rate of 5.5 percent. The rate would also be 5.5 percent today if you refinanced this loan. The third type of debt is a bond issue that the firm sold two years ago for $11 million. The market value of these bonds today is $10 million. Using the approach we discussed earlier, you have estimated that the effective annual yield on the bonds is 7 percent.
Preferred Stock The preferred stock pays an annual dividend of 4.5 percent on a stated value of $100. A share of this stock is currently selling for $60, and there are 100,000 shares outstanding.
Common Stock There are 1 million shares of common stock outstanding, and they are currently selling for $21 each. Using a regression analysis, you have estimated that the beta of these shares is 1.1.
The 30-year Treasury bond rate is currently 1.678 percent, and you have estimated the market risk premium to be 6.11 percent using the returns on stocks and Treasury bonds from the 1926 to 2019 period. Your firm’s marginal tax rate is 26 percent. What is the WACC for your firm?

The first step in computing the WACC is to calculate the pretax cost of debt. Since the market value of the firm’s debt is $17 million ($4 million + $3 million + $10 million = $17 million), we can calculate the pretax cost of debt as follows:

Note that because the $4 million and $3 million loans have rates that equal what it would cost to refinance them today, their market values equal the amount that is owed. Since the $10 million market value of the bond issue is below the $11 million face value, the rate that firm is actually paying must be lower than the 7 percent rate you estimated to reflect the current cost of this debt. Recall that as interest rates increase, the market value of a bond decreases. This is the negative relation that we referred to earlier in this chapter.

We next calculate the cost of the preferred stock using Equation 13.6, as follows:

From Equation 13.4, we calculate the cost of the common equity to be:

We are now ready to use Equation 13.7 to calculate the firm’s WACC. Since the firm has $17 million of debt, $6 million of preferred stock ($60 per share × 100,000 shares = $6 million), and $21 million of common equity ($21 per share × 1,000,000 shares = $21 million), the total market value of its capital is $44 million ($17 million + $6 million + $21 million = $44 million). The firm’s WACC is therefore:

After calculating the cost of the common equity in your pizza business to be 4.06 percent (see Learning by Doing Application 13.3), you have decided to estimate the WACC. You recently hired a business appraiser to estimate the value of your stock, which includes all of the outstanding common equity. His report indicates that it is worth $500 million.

In order to finance the 2,000 restaurants that are now part of your company, you have sold three different bond issues. Based on the current prices of the bonds from these issues and the issue characteristics (face values and coupon rates), you have estimated the market values and effective annual yields to be:

Bond Issue	Value ($ millions)	Effective Annual Yield
1	$100	   3.50%
2	  187	3.00
3	  154	4.40
Total	$441	 
Your company has no other long-term debt or any preferred stock outstanding. Both the marginal and average tax rates for your company are 20 percent. What is the WACC for your pizza business?

You are a financial analyst for the company whose WACC of 6.89 percent we just calculated in the main text. One day, your manager walks into your office and tells you that she is thinking about selling $23 million of common stock and using the proceeds from the sale to pay back both of the firm’s loans and to repurchase all of the outstanding bonds and preferred stock. She tells you that this is a smart move because if she does this, the beta of the firm’s common stock will decline to 0.90 and the overall kcs will decline from 8.40 percent to 7.18 percent:

What do you tell your manager?



Limitations of WACC as a Discount Rate for Evaluating Projects
At the beginning of this chapter, we told you that financial managers often require analysts within the firm to use the firm’s current cost of capital to discount the cash flows for individual projects. They do so because it is very difficult to directly estimate the discount rate for individual projects. You should recognize by now that the WACC is the discount rate that analysts are often required to use. Using the WACC to discount the cash flows for a project can make sense under certain circumstances. However, in other circumstances, it can lead to making the wrong decision. The rest of this section discusses when it makes sense to use the WACC as a discount rate and the problems that can occur when the WACC is used incorrectly.

Chapter 11 discussed how an analyst forecasting the cash flows for a project is forecasting the incremental after-tax free cash flows at the firm level. These cash flows represent the difference between the cash flows that the firm will generate if the project is adopted and the cash flows that the firm will generate if the project is not adopted.

Financial theory tells us that the rate that should be used to discount these incremental cash flows is the rate that reflects their systematic risk. This means that the WACC is going to be the appropriate discount rate for evaluating a project only when the project has cash flows with systematic risks that are exactly the same as those for the firm as a whole. Unfortunately, this is not true for most projects. The firm itself is a portfolio of projects with varying degrees of risk.

When a single rate, such as the WACC, is used to discount cash flows for projects with varying levels of risk, the discount rate will be too low in some cases and too high in others. When the discount rate is too low, the firm runs the risk of accepting a negative NPV project. To see how this might happen, assume that you work at a company that manufactures soft drinks and that the managers at your company are concerned about the competition in the core soft drink business. They are thinking about expanding into the manufacture and sale of exotic tropical beverages. The managers believe that entering this market would allow the firm to better differentiate its products and earn higher profits. Suppose also that the appropriate beta for soft drink projects is 1.2, while the appropriate beta for tropical beverage projects is 1.5. Since your firm is only in the soft drink business right now, the beta for its overall cash flows is 1.2. Exhibit 13.3 illustrates the problem that could arise if your firm’s WACC is used to evaluate a tropical beverage project.

In Exhibit 13.3, you can see that since the beta of the tropical beverage project is larger than the beta of the firm as a whole, the expected return (or discount rate) for the tropical beverage project should be higher than the firm’s WACC. The Security Market Line indicates what this expected return should be. Now, if the firm’s WACC is used to discount the expected cash flows for this project, and the expected return on the project is above the firm’s WACC, then the estimated NPV will be positive. So far, so good. However, as illustrated in Exhibit 13.3, some projects may have an expected return that is above the WACC but below the SML. For projects such as those, using the WACC as the discount rate may actually cause the firm to accept a negative NPV project! The estimated NPV will be positive even though the true NPV is negative. The negative NPV projects that would be accepted in those situations have returns that fall in the red shaded area below the SML, above the WACC line, and to the right of the firm’s beta.

In Exhibit 13.3 you can also see that using the WACC to discount expected cash flows for low-risk projects can result in managers at the firm rejecting projects that have positive NPVs. This problem is, in some sense, the mirror image of the case where the WACC is lower than the correct discount rate. Financial managers run the risk of turning down positive NPV projects whenever the WACC is higher than the correct discount rate. The positive NPV projects that would be rejected are those that fall into the green shaded area that is below the WACC but above the SML and to the left of the firm’s beta.

EXHIBIT 13.3 Potential Errors When Using the WACC to Evaluate Projects Two types of problems can arise when the WACC for a firm is used to evaluate individual projects: positive NPV projects may, be rejected, or negative NPV projects may be accepted. For the tropical beverage example, if the expected return on that project was below the level indicated by the SML, but above the firm’s WACC, the project might be accepted even though it would have a negative NPV.


To see how these types of problems arise, consider a project that requires an initial investment of $100 million and that is expected to produce cash inflows of $40 million per year for three years. If the correct discount rate for this project is 8 percent, its NPV will be:

This is an attractive project because it returns more than the investors’ opportunity cost of capital.

Suppose, however, that the financial managers of the firm considering this project require that all projects be evaluated using the firm’s WACC of 11 percent. When the cash flows are discounted using a rate of 11 percent, the NPV is:

As you can see, when the WACC is used to discount the cash flows, the firm will end up rejecting a positive NPV project. The firm will be passing up an opportunity to create value for its stockholders. As an exercise, you might try constructing a numerical example in which a firm accepts a negative NPV project.

It is also important to recognize that when a firm uses a single rate to evaluate all of its projects, there will be a bias toward accepting more risky projects. The average risk of the firm’s assets will tend to increase over time. Furthermore, because some positive NPV projects are likely to be rejected and some negative NPV projects are likely to be accepted, new projects on the whole will probably create less value for stockholders than if the appropriate discount rate had been used to evaluate all projects. This, in turn, can put the firm at a disadvantage when compared with its competitors and adversely affect the value of its existing projects.

The key point to take away from this discussion is that it is only correct to use a firm’s WACC to discount the cash flows for a project if the expected cash flows from that project have the same systematic risk as the expected cash flows from the firm as a whole. You might be wondering how you can tell when this condition exists. The answer is that we never know for sure. Nevertheless, there are some guidelines that you can use when assessing whether the systematic risk for a particular project is similar to that for the firm as a whole.

The systematic risk of the cash flows from a project depend on the nature of the business. Revenues and expenses in some businesses are affected more by changes in general economic conditions than revenues and expenses in other businesses. For example, consider the differences between a company that makes bread and a company that makes recreational vehicles. The demand for bread will be relatively constant in good economic conditions and in bad. The demand for recreational vehicles will be more volatile. People buy fewer recreational vehicles during recessions than when the economy is doing well.

While total volatility is not the same as systematic volatility, businesses with more total volatility (uncertainty or risk) typically have more systematic volatility. Since beta is a measure of systematic risk, and systematic risk is a key factor in determining a firm’s WACC, this suggests that the firm’s WACC should be used only for projects with business risks similar to those for the firm as a whole. Since financial managers usually think of systematic risk when they think of underlying business risks, we can restate this condition as follows:

Condition 1 A firm’s WACC should be used to evaluate the cash flows for a new project only if the level of systematic risk for the project is the same as that for the portfolio of projects that currently comprise the firm.
You have to consider one other factor when you decide whether it is appropriate to use a firm’s WACC to discount the cash flows for a project. That is the way in which the project will be financed and how this financing compares with the way the firm’s assets are financed. To better understand why this is important, consider Equation 13.7:

This equation provides a measure of the firm’s cost of capital that reflects both how the firm’s assets have been financed—that is, the mix of debt and preferred and common stock that was used to acquire those assets—and the current cost of each type of financing. In other words, the WACC reflects both the x’s and the k’s associated with the firm’s financing. Why is this important? Because the costs of the different types of capital depend on the fraction of the total firm financing that each represents. If the firm uses more or less debt, the cost of debt will be higher or lower. In turn, the cost of both preferred stock and common stock will be affected. This means that even if the underlying business risk of the project is the same as that for the firm as a whole, if the project is financed differently than the firm as a whole the appropriate discount rate for the project analysis will be different from that for the firm as a whole.

Condition 2 A firm’s WACC should be used to evaluate a project only if that project uses the same financing mix—the same proportions of debt, preferred shares, and common shares—used to finance the firm as a whole.
In summary, WACC is a measure of the current cost of the capital that the firm is using to finance its projects. It is an appropriate discount rate for evaluating projects only if (1) the project’s systematic risk is the same as that of the firm’s current portfolio of projects and (2) the project will be financed with the same mix of debt and equity as the firm’s current portfolio of projects. If either of these two conditions does not hold, then managers should be careful in using the firm’s current WACC to evaluate a project.

Alternatives to Using WACC for Evaluating Projects
Financial managers understand the limitations of using a firm’s WACC to evaluate projects, but they also know that there are no perfect alternatives. As we noted earlier in this chapter, there is no publicly traded common stock for most individual projects within a firm. It is, therefore, not possible to directly estimate the beta for the common stock used to finance an individual project.9 Although it might be possible to obtain an estimate of the cost of debt from the firm’s bankers, without an estimate of the common stock beta—and, therefore, the cost of common stock—it is not possible to obtain a direct estimate of the appropriate discount rate for a project using Equation 13.7.

If the discount rate for a project cannot be estimated directly, a financial analyst might try to find a public firm that is in a business that is similar to that of the project. For example, in our exotic tropical beverage example, an analyst at the soft drink company might look for a company that produces only exotic tropical beverages and that also has publicly traded stock. This public company would be what financial analysts call a pure-play comparable because it is exactly like the project. The returns on the pure-play comparable company’s stock could be used to estimate the expected return on the equity that is used to finance the project. Unfortunately, this approach is generally not feasible due to the difficulty of finding a public firm that is only in the business represented by the project. If the public firm is in other businesses as well, then we run into the same sorts of problems that we face when we use the firm’s WACC.

pure-play comparable a comparable company that is in exactly the same business as the project or business being analyzed

From a practical standpoint, financial managers, such as company treasurers and chief financial officers, do not like letting analysts estimate the discount rates for their projects. Different analysts tend to make different assumptions or use different approaches, which can lead to inconsistencies that make it difficult to compare projects. In addition, analysts may be tempted to manipulate discount rates in order to make pet projects look more attractive.

In an effort to use discount rates that reflect project risks better than the firm’s WACC, while retaining control of the process through which discount rates are set, financial managers sometimes classify projects into categories based on their systematic risks. They then specify a discount rate that is to be used to discount the cash flows for all projects within each category. The idea is that each category of projects has a different level of systematic risk and therefore a different discount rate should be used for each. Exhibit 13.4 illustrates such a classification scheme.

EXHIBIT 13.4 Potential Errors When Using Multiple Discount Rates to Evaluate Projects The potential for errors—either rejecting a positive NPV project or accepting a negative NPV project—is smaller when discount rates better reflect the risk of the projects that they are used to evaluate. You can see this by noting that the total size of the shaded areas in this figure is smaller than the size of the shaded areas in Exhibit 13.3. In the ideal situation, where the correct discount rate is used for each project, there would be no shaded area at all in a figure like this.


The scheme illustrated in Exhibit 13.4 includes four project categories:

Efficiency projects, such as the implementation of a new production technology that reduces manufacturing costs for an existing product.
Product extension projects, such as those in which Boeing created variations of its aircraft, such as the Boeing 737, to help meet customer needs.
Market extension projects, in which existing products are sold in new markets, such as when Texas Instruments considers selling a new version of a computer chip that has been used in digital phones to digital camera manufacturers.
New product projects, in which entirely new products are being considered.
When using the scheme illustrated in Exhibit 13.4, the financial manager would assign a discount rate for each category that reflects the typical beta in the indicated range of betas. Such an approach is attractive because it is not generally difficult for analysts to figure out in which of the four categories particular projects belong, and it limits their discretion in choosing discount rates. Most important, it can reduce the possibility of accepting negative NPV projects or rejecting positive NPV projects. We can see the latter benefit by comparing the shaded areas in the figures in Exhibits 13.3 and 13.4. The total size of the shaded areas, which represents the possibility of making an error, is much smaller in Exhibit 13.4.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Explain what the weighted average cost of capital for a firm is and why it is often used as a discount rate to evaluate projects.

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a firm is a weighted average of the current costs of the different types of financing that a firm has used to finance the purchase of its assets. When the WACC is calculated, the cost of each type of financing is weighted according to the fraction of the total firm value represented by that type of financing. The WACC is often used as a discount rate in evaluating projects because it is not possible to directly estimate the appropriate discount rate for many projects. As we also discuss in Section 13.4, having a single discount rate reduces inconsistencies that can arise when different analysts in the firm use different methods to estimate the discount rate and can also limit the ability of analysts to manipulate discount rates to favor pet projects.

2 Calculate the cost of debt for a firm.

The cost of debt can be calculated by solving for the yield to maturity of the debt using the bond pricing model (Equation 8.1), computing the effective annual yield, and adjusting for taxes using Equation 13.3.

3 Calculate the cost of common stock and the cost of preferred stock for a firm.

The cost of common stock can be estimated using the CAPM, the constant-growth dividend model, or a multistage-growth dividend model. The cost of preferred stock can be calculated using the perpetuity model for the present value of cash flows.

4 Calculate the weighted average cost of capital for a firm, explain the limitations of using a firm’s weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate when evaluating a project, and discuss the alternatives to the firm’s weighted average cost of capital.

The weighted average cost of capital is estimated using either Equation 13.2 or Equation 13.7, with the cost of each individual type of financing estimated using the appropriate method.

When a firm uses a single rate to discount the cash flows for all of its projects, some project cash flows will be discounted using a rate that is too high and other project cash flows will be discounted using a rate that is too low. This can result in the firm rejecting some positive NPV projects and accepting some negative NPV projects. It will bias the firm toward accepting more risky projects and can cause the firm to create less value for stockholders than it would have if the appropriate discount rates had been used.

One alternative to using the WACC as a discount rate is to identify a firm that engages in business activities that are similar to those associated with the project under consideration and that has publicly traded stock. The returns from this pure-play comparable firm’s stock can then be used to estimate the common stock beta for the project. In instances where pure-play comparable firms are not available, another alternative is for the financial manager to classify projects according to their systematic risks and use a different discount rate for each class of project. This is the type of classification scheme illustrated in Exhibit 13.4.

13.35 You are working as an intern at Coral Gables Products, a privately owned manufacturing company. Shortly after you read Chapter 13 in this book, you got into a discussion with the chief financial officer (CFO) at Coral Gables about weighted average cost of capital calculations. She pointed out that, just as the beta of the assets of a firm equals a weighted average of the betas for the individual assets, as shown in Equation 7.13:

the beta of the assets of a firm also equals a weighted average of the betas for the debt, preferred stock, and common stock of a firm:

Why must this be true?

13.36 The CFO described in Problem 13.35 asks you to estimate the beta for Coral Gables’ common stock. Since the common stock is not publicly traded, you do not have the data necessary to estimate the beta using regression analysis. However, you have found a company with publicly traded stock that has operations exactly like those at Coral Gables. Using stock returns for this pure-play comparable firm, you estimate the beta for the comparable company’s stock to be 1.06. The market value of that company’s common equity is $45 million, and it has one debt issue outstanding with a market value of $15 million and an annual pretax cost of 4.85 percent. The comparable company has no preferred stock.

If the risk-free rate today is 4.25 percent and the market risk premium is 6.00 percent, what is the beta of the assets of the comparable company?
If the total market value of Coral Gables’ financing consists of 35 percent debt and 65 percent equity (this is what the CFO estimates the market values to be) and the pretax cost of its debt is 5.45 percent, what is the beta for Coral Gables’ common stock?

Notes
1 Surveys of capital budgeting practices at major public firms in the United States indicate that a large percentage (possibly as high as 80 percent) of firms use the cost of capital for a firm or a division in capital budgeting calculations. For a discussion of this evidence, see the article titled “Best Practices in Estimating the Cost of Capital: Survey and Synthesis,” by R. F. Bruner, K. M. Eades, R. S. Harris, and R. C. Higgins, which was published in the Spring/Summer 1998 issue of Financial Practice and Education.
2 The total expected cash flows at Boeing also include cash flows from projects that the firm is expected to undertake in the future, or what are often referred to as growth opportunities.
3 We will discuss how firms finance their assets in more detail in Chapters 15 and 16. For the time being, we will simply assume that a firm uses some combination of debt and equity. Here we use the term debt in the broadest sense to refer to all liabilities, including liabilities on which the firm does not pay interest, such as accounts payable. As is common practice, we focus only on long-term interest-bearing debt, such as bank loans and bonds, in the cost of capital calculations. The reason for this is discussed in the next section.
4 As we will discuss in Section 13.2, if markets are efficient, the prices we observe in the markets will reflect the true costs of the different securities that the firm has outstanding.
5 We are ignoring the effect of taxes on the cost of debt financing for the time being. This effect is discussed in detail in Section 13.2 and explicitly incorporated into subsequent calculations.
6 These types of costs are incurred by firms whenever they raise capital. We only show how to include them in the cost of bond financing and, later, in estimating the cost of preferred stock, but they should also be included in calculations of the costs of capital from other sources, such as bank loans and common equity.
7 There is a limit on the total amount of home loan interest payments that you can deduct when you calculate your taxable income. For instance, in 2020 you could deduct interest payments on loans with a total face value of $750,000 for mortgages taken out after December 16, 2017. In 2017 a new federal law H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, introduced major changes to the federal tax code, including a limit to the tax deductibility of interest for corporations. For more information on the implications of this limit for the after-tax cost of debt and WACC, please refer to the appendix in your Wiley Course Resources.
8 We use the term risk-free here to refer to assets that have no default risk. Investors in such assets can still face interest rate risk, as described in Chapter 8.
9 A few U.S. firms have issued a type of stock that has an equity claim on only part of their business. If a project is similar to the part of the business for which “tracking stock” like this has been sold, the returns on the tracking stock can be used to estimate the beta for the common stock used to finance the project.

Describe three current asset financing strategies, and discuss the main sources of short-term financing.
Since its founding in 1976 by partners Steve Jobs, Ronald Wayne, and Steve Wozniak, Apple Inc. has been a cutting-edge retailer of consumer electronics and computing software. With hardware products that include the Mac line of computers, Beats headphones, the iPhone and iPad tablet, and online retail businesses, including iTunes and Apple music, Apple Inc. has grown to become one of the largest publicly traded corporations in the world, with a market capitalization of approximately $2.2 trillion in January 2021.

Although much of Apple’s success can be attributed to its innovative designs and strong worldwide demand for its products, the firm’s sophisticated approach to managing supply chain and hardware production is seen by many analysts and investors as a critical component of the firm’s success. Apple’s focus on managing these aspects of its operations is driven by former chief operating officer and current chief executive officer Tim Cook, who has often publicly related the mantra that “inventory is evil” because of its high cost and rapid depreciation.

Mr. Cook shut down the company’s manufacturing businesses, opting instead to work with contract manufacturers around the world who build to order with customer demand. This in turn reduces Apple’s need to stock inventories of components and finished hardware, allowing the firm to virtually eliminate its warehouses while keeping only a limited number of products on hand in its Apple retail stores. Apple continues to streamline its production and inventory practices. When a consumer places a hardware order online today, assembly and shipping typically originate directly from a manufacturing facility in China. This allows Apple to minimize inventory in its supply chain.

The focus of this chapter is on working capital management—which deals with the management of current assets, including cash, accounts receivable, and inventory—and how these assets are financed. In managing its working capital, Apple has concentrated on its inventory policies because inventory can comprise a significant portion of a firm’s balance sheet and can be subject to periodic write-downs. As we will discuss, Apple is an industry leader in working capital management efficiency, and its working capital management policies contribute significantly to the returns it earns on the capital invested in its businesses.

Chapter Preview
The previous chapters dealt with long-term investment decisions and their impact on firm value. These capital investment decisions typically commit a firm to a course of action for a number of years and are difficult to reverse. In contrast, this chapter focuses on short-term activities that involve cash inflows and outflows that occur within a year or less. Examples include purchasing and paying for raw materials, managing the firm’s investment in finished inventory, and collecting cash for sales made on credit. These types of activities comprise what is known as working capital management.

The term working capital refers to the short-term assets necessary to run a business on a day-to-day basis. These assets include cash, accounts receivable, and inventory and are typically funded by short-term liabilities such as accounts payable. Because of the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities, decisions involving them are more flexible and easily reversed than capital investment decisions. The greater flexibility associated with working capital management does not mean that these activities are not important, however. The management of short-term assets and liabilities can have a significant impact on the cash flow available to a firm’s investors. In extreme cases, poor working capital management can result in severe financial consequences, including bankruptcy.

We begin the chapter by reviewing some basic definitions and concepts. Next, we examine the individual working capital accounts and discuss how to determine and analyze the operating and cash conversion cycles. Then we explain how to manage the different working capital accounts: the cash account, accounts receivable, and inventory. We finish by considering alternative means of financing short-term assets and the risks associated with each.

14.1 Working Capital Basics
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Define net working capital, discuss the importance of working capital management, and compute a firm’s net working capital.
Working capital management involves two fundamental questions: (1) What is the appropriate amount and mix of short-term assets for the firm to hold? (2) How should these short-term assets be financed? Firms must carry a certain amount of short-term assets to be able to operate smoothly. For example, without sufficient cash on hand, a company facing an unexpected expense might not be able to pay its bills on time. Without an inventory of raw materials, production might be subject to costly interruptions or shutdowns. Without an inventory of finished goods, sales might be lost because a product is out of stock.

To provide a background for the discussion of working capital management, we first briefly review some important terminology and ideas. Throughout the chapter, we use financial statements and supporting data from Apple Inc. to illustrate our discussions. Exhibit 14.1 presents Apple’s balance sheet and income statement for the fiscal year that ended September 26, 2020.

Working Capital Terms and Concepts
In earlier chapters, we discussed the basic terms associated with working capital management. Here, we provide a brief review:

Current assets are cash and other assets that the firm expects to convert into cash in a year or less. These assets are usually listed on the balance sheet in order of their liquidity. Typical current assets include cash, short-term investments (sometimes also called marketable securities or cash equivalents because of their liquidity), accounts receivable, inventory, and others, such as prepaid expenses. At the end of its 2020 fiscal year, Apple’s total current assets were $143,713 million.
Current liabilities (or short-term liabilities) are obligations that the firm expects to repay in a year or less. They may be interest bearing, such as short-term notes and current maturities of long-term debt, or noninterest bearing, such as accounts payable, deferred revenue, and accrued expenses. On September 26, 2020, Apple’s total current liabilities were $105,392 million.
Working capital (also called gross working capital) includes the funds invested in a company’s cash and short-term investment accounts, accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets. All firms require a certain amount of current assets to operate smoothly and to carry out day-to-day operations. Note that working capital is defined in terms of current assets, so the two terms are one and the same. Thus, Apple’s working capital was $143,713 million on September 26, 2020.
Net working capital (NWC) refers to the difference between current assets and current liabilities.1

NWC is important because it is a measure of a firm’s liquidity. It is a measure of liquidity because it is the amount of working capital a firm would have left over after it paid off all of its short-term liabilities. The larger the firm’s net working capital, the greater its liquidity. Most firms have more current assets than current liabilities, and therefore their net working capital is positive. Apple’s net working capital on September 26, 2020, was $38,321 million ($143,713 million − $105,392 million = $38,321 million).

Working capital management involves management of current assets and their financing. The financial manager’s responsibilities include determining the optimum balance for each of the current asset accounts and deciding what mix of short-term debt, long-term debt, and equity to use in financing working capital. Working capital management decisions are usually fast paced, as they reflect the firm’s day-to-day operations.
Working capital efficiency is a term that refers to how efficiently working capital is used. It is most commonly measured by a firm’s cash conversion cycle, which reflects the time between the point at which raw materials are paid for and the point at which finished goods made from those materials are converted into cash. The shorter a firm’s cash conversion cycle, the more efficient its use of working capital.
Liquidity is the ability of a company to convert assets—real or financial—into cash quickly without suffering a financial loss.
Working Capital Accounts and Trade-Offs
Short-term cash inflows and outflows do not always match in their timing or magnitude, creating a need to manage the working capital accounts. The objective of the managers of these accounts is to enable the company to operate effectively with the smallest possible net investment in working capital. To do this, managers must make cost/benefit trade-offs. The trade-offs arise because it is easier to run a business with a generous amount of net working capital, but it is also more costly to do so. Let’s briefly look at each working capital account to see what the basic trade-offs are. Keep in mind as you read the discussion that working capital assets are costly for the firm to hold because they must be financed by borrowing or selling equity or by using cash from operations that could otherwise be paid out to the firm’s investors. The working capital accounts that are the focus of most working capital management activities are as follows:

Cash (including short-term investments): The more cash a firm has on hand, the more likely it will be able to meet its financial obligations if an unexpected expense occurs or take advantage of an unexpected investment opportunity. If cash balances become too small, the firm runs the risk that it will be unable to pay its bills; and if this condition becomes chronic, creditors could force the firm into bankruptcy. The downside of holding too much cash is that the returns on cash are low even when it is invested in an interest-paying bank account or highly liquid short-term money market instruments, such as U.S. government Treasury securities.
Receivables: The accounts receivable at a firm represent the total unpaid credit that the firm has extended to its customers. Accounts receivable can include trade credit (credit extended to another business) or consumer credit (credit extended to a consumer), or both. Businesses provide trade and consumer credit because doing so increases sales and because it is often a competitive necessity to match the credit terms offered by competitors. The downside to granting such credit is that it is expensive to evaluate customers’ credit applications to ensure that they are creditworthy and then to monitor their ongoing credit performance. Firms that are not diligent in managing their credit operations can suffer large losses from bad debts, especially during a recession, when customers may have trouble paying their bills.

trade credit credit extended by one business to another

consumer credit credit extended by a business to a consumer

Inventory: Customers want firms to maintain large finished goods inventories because when they go to make a purchase, the item they want will likely be in stock. Similarly, large raw material inventories reduce the chance that the firm will not have access to raw materials when they are needed, which can cause costly interruptions in the manufacturing process. At the same time, large inventories are expensive to finance, can require warehouses that are expensive to build and maintain, must be protected against breakage and theft, and run a greater risk of obsolescence.
Payables: Accounts payable are trade credits provided to firms by their suppliers. Because suppliers typically grant a grace period before payables must be repaid, and firms do not have to pay interest during this period, trade credit is an attractive source of financing. For this reason, financial managers do not hurry to pay their suppliers when bills arrive. Of course, suppliers recognize that they provide attractive financing to their customers and that trade credit is expensive for them. Consequently, suppliers tend to provide strong incentives (either by providing discounts for paying on time or charging penalties for late payment) for firms to pay on time. As you might expect, firms typically wait until near the end of the grace period to repay trade credit. The financial manager at a firm that is having serious financial problems may have no choice but to delay paying its suppliers. However, besides incurring monetary penalties, a manager who is consistently late in making payments runs the risk that the supplier will no longer sell to his or her firm on credit.
When the financial manager makes a decision to increase working capital, good things are likely to happen to the firm—sales should increase, relationships with vendors and suppliers should improve, and work or manufacturing stoppages should be less likely. Unfortunately, the extra working capital costs money, and there is no simple algorithm or formula that determines the optimal level of working capital the firm should hold. The choice depends on management’s strategic preferences, its willingness to bear risk, and the firm’s line of business.

14.2 The Operating and Cash Conversion Cycles
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Define the operating and cash conversion cycles, explain how they are used, and compute their values for a firm.
A very important concept in working capital management is known as the cash conversion cycle. This is the length of time from the point at which a company actually pays for raw materials until the point at which it receives cash from the sale of finished goods made from those materials. This is an important concept because the length of the cash conversion cycle is directly related to the amount of money that a firm needs to finance its working capital.

cash conversion cycle the length of time from the point at which a company pays for raw materials until the point at which it receives cash from the sale of finished goods made from those materials

EXHIBIT 14.2 The Cash Conversion Cycle A typical cash conversion cycle begins with cash outflows for raw materials and conversion costs and goes through several stages before these resources are turned back into cash. The cash conversion cycle reflects the average time from the point that cash is used to pay for raw materials until cash is collected on the accounts receivable associated with the product produced with those raw materials. One of the main goals of a financial manager is to optimize the time between the cash outflows and the cash inflows.


The sequence of events that occurs from the point in time that a firm actually pays for its raw materials to the point that it receives cash from the sale of finished goods is as follows: (1) the firm uses cash to pay for raw materials and the cost of converting them into finished goods (conversion costs), (2) finished goods are held in finished goods inventory until they are sold, (3) finished goods are sold on credit to the firm’s customers, and finally, (4) customers repay the credit the firm has extended them and the firm receives the cash. The cash is then reinvested in raw materials and conversion costs, and the cycle is repeated. Exhibit 14.2 shows a schematic diagram of the cash conversion cycle.

Financial managers generally want to achieve several goals in managing this cycle:

Delay paying accounts payable as long as possible without suffering any penalties.
Maintain the minimum level of raw material inventories necessary to support production without causing manufacturing delays.
Use as little labor and other inputs to the production process as possible while maintaining product quality.
Maintain the level of finished goods inventory that represents the best trade-off between minimizing the amount of capital invested in finished goods inventory and the desire to avoid lost sales.
Offer customers terms on trade credit that are sufficiently attractive to support sales and yet minimize the cost of this credit, both the financing cost and the risk of nonpayment.
Collect cash payments on accounts receivable as quickly as possible to close the loop.
All of these goals have implications for the firm’s efficiency and liquidity. It is the financial manager’s responsibility to ensure that he or she makes decisions that maximize the value of the firm. Managing the length of the cash conversion cycle is one aspect of managing working capital to maximize the value of the firm.2 Next, we discuss two simple tools to measure working capital efficiency. As you read the discussion, refer to Exhibit 14.3.

EXHIBIT 14.3 Time Line for Operating and Cash Conversion Cycles for Apple Inc. in 2020 The exhibit shows the cash inflows and outflows and other key events in a firm’s operating cycle and cash conversion cycle, along with computed values for Apple. Both of these cycles are used for measuring working capital efficiency.


Operating Cycle
The operating cycle starts with the receipt of raw materials and ends with the collection of cash from customers for the sale of finished goods made from those materials. The operating cycle can be described in terms of two components: days’ sales in inventory and days’ sales outstanding. The formulas for these efficiency ratios were developed in Chapter 4. Apple’s ratios and the average ratios for several large comparison companies are shown in Exhibit 14.4.

operating cycle the average time between receipt of raw materials and receipt of cash for the sale of finished goods made from those materials

Days’ sales in inventory (DSI) shows, on average, how long a firm holds inventory before selling it. Recall from Chapter 4 that it is calculated by dividing 365 days by the firm’s inventory turnover and that inventory turnover equals cost of goods sold (COGS) divided by inventory. Equation 4.4 and the formula for DSI, along with a calculation for Apple in 2020, are as follows:

EXHIBIT 14.4 Selected Financial Ratios for Apple Inc. and Comparison Companies in 2020

When we compare working capital ratios for Apple with average ratios for Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard, and Alphabet, we see that Apple is outperforming these comparison firms on all metrics. Apple holds less inventory, collects on its outstanding balances more quickly, and is able to defer its cash payments to suppliers longer. These three facts combined ensure that Apple’s operating and cash conversion cycles are significantly shorter than the comparison companies. Note that a negative cash conversion cycle of −60.87 days means that Apple collects cash from its customers before it has to pay its suppliers. Thus, Apple’s suppliers are financing all of Apple’s working capital and then some.

Financial Ratio	Apple	Comparison Firm Average
Days’ sales in inventory (DSI)	  8.74	25.45
Days’ sales outstanding (DSO)	21.43	49.68
Days’ payables outstanding (DPO)	91.05	81.27
Operating cycle (days)	30.18	75.13
Cash conversion cycle (days)	−60.87 	−6.14
As shown in Exhibit 14.4, the comparison firm average for days’ sales in inventory is 25.45 days, while for Apple it is 8.74 days. Inventory management has long been a critical factor in Apple’s success, as discussed in the chapter opener. For the most part, Apple first takes the order from the customer and then routes the order to a contract manufacturer. According to the DSI ratio, it takes Apple a little less than nine days to complete this process, whereas the average comparison firm takes almost four weeks to complete the same task.

Days’ sales outstanding (DSO) indicates how long it takes, on average, for the firm to collect its outstanding accounts receivable. Recall from Chapter 4 that DSO is calculated by dividing 365 days by accounts receivable turnover and that accounts receivable turnover equals net sales divided by accounts receivable. Sometimes this ratio is called the average collection period. An efficient firm with good working capital management should have a low average collection period compared with that of other firms. Equation 4.6, the DSO formula, and the calculation for Apple are as follows:

Again, referring to Exhibit 14.4 we see that the average comparison firm has 49.68 days of sales outstanding, while Apple’s figure is 21.43 days. In 2020 Apple was doing a good job of quickly collecting the cash it was owed by its customers. This ratio helps to explain how Apple is managing its current assets more efficiently than other firms.

We can now calculate the operating cycle by summing the days’ sales in inventory and the days’ sales outstanding.

(14.1)
Apple’s operating cycle for 2020 is 30.18 days (8.74 days + 21.43 days = 30.18 days), and the comparison firm average is 75.13 days (25.45 days + 49.68 days = 75.13 days). Apple manages to complete its operating cycle in less than one half the time it takes the average comparison firm, which means Apple is managing its working capital more efficiently than the comparison firms.

Cash Conversion Cycle
The cash conversion cycle is related to the operating cycle, but the cash conversion cycle does not begin until the firm actually pays for its raw materials. In other words, the cash conversion cycle is the length of time between the actual cash outflow for materials and the actual cash inflow from sales. To calculate this cycle, we need all of the information used to calculate the operating cycle plus one additional measure: days’ payables outstanding.

Days’ payables outstanding (DPO) tells us how long, on average, a firm takes to pay its suppliers. Recall that it is calculated by dividing 365 days by accounts payable turnover and that accounts payable turnover equals COGS divided by accounts payable. The DPO formula and the calculation for Apple are:

The comparison firm average DPO is 81.27 days, and the DPO for Apple is 91.05 days. Apple takes an average of almost ten days longer than the comparison firms to make payments to its suppliers.

We can now calculate the cash conversion cycle by summing the days’ sales in inventory and the days’ sales outstanding and subtracting the days’ payables outstanding:

(14.2)
Apple’s cash conversion cycle is −60.87 days. Another way to calculate the cash conversion cycle is to notice that it is simply the operating cycle minus the days’ payables outstanding, as can be seen in Exhibit 14.3:

(14.3)
Thus, Apple’s cash conversion cycle for 2020 can be calculated as 30.18 days − 91.05 days = −60.87 days.

A negative cash conversion cycle of −60.87 days means that Apple receives cash from its customers an average of about 61 days before it pays its suppliers. In other words, instead of Apple having to invest in inventories and receivables, its suppliers finance all of these current assets and then some. A direct comparison of the accounts receivable and inventory balances ($16,120 and $4,061, respectively) with the accounts payable balance ($42,296) in Exhibit 14.1 reveals that the financing provided by Apple’s suppliers is more than twice the amount the firm has invested in accounts receivable and inventories.

Apple has been able to achieve a negative cash conversion cycle through careful management of its accounts receivable and payable. In addition, the company outsources much of its manufacturing, which reduces its days’ sales in inventory to just under nine days. We discuss just-in-time inventory systems in more detail later in this chapter.

By now, it should be clear that the comparison firms as a whole have a much longer cash conversion cycle than Apple. The comparison firm average is −6.14 days, and Apple’s is −60.87 days.

Apple has built its reputation and overall firm strategy on being an efficient quality provider and has historically enjoyed great success. But Apple is not very representative of the average firm.

Measuring Kernel Mills’s Working Capital Efficiency

Problem

Kernel Mills is a manufacturing firm in the food industry. The board of directors would like to know how efficiently the firm’s working capital is being managed. They are particularly interested in the cash conversion cycle. Exhibit 14.5 shows the financial statements for Kernel Mills, as well as some data from the food industry for comparison.

14.3 Working Capital Management Strategies
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of pursuing (1) flexible and (2) restrictive current asset management strategies.
One of the financial manager’s key decisions with regard to working capital is to determine how much money should be invested in current assets for a given level of sales. To the extent that managers have limited ability to increase days’ payables outstanding without the risk of incurring high costs (losing discounts or having to pay penalties), choosing the level of current assets that the firm holds is essentially the same as choosing the amount of net working capital. Since more net working capital provides a firm with greater financial flexibility, but at a higher cost than a more restrictive (less flexible) strategy, choosing the appropriate amount of net working capital involves making trade-offs.

Flexible Current Asset Management Strategy
A firm that follows a flexible current asset management strategy might hold large balances of cash, short-term investments, and inventory. It might also offer liberal credit terms to customers, which results in high levels of accounts receivable. A flexible strategy is generally perceived to be a low-risk and low-return course of action. A principal benefit of such a strategy is that large working capital balances improve the firm’s ability to survive unforeseen threats. This reduces the size of the firm’s exposure to fluctuations in business conditions.

flexible current asset management strategy current asset management strategy that involves keeping high balances of current assets on hand

The downsides of such a strategy can include low returns on current assets, potentially high inventory carrying costs, and the cost of financing liberal credit terms. As discussed earlier, returns on cash and short-term investments can be low. Other current assets also usually earn lower returns than long-term assets. For example, inventory sitting on the shelf earns no interest income. Thus, by investing in current assets, management foregoes the higher rate of return it could have earned by investing in long-term assets. This is an opportunity cost. Furthermore, large investments in some types of inventory can require significant storage, tax, and insurance costs.

inventory carrying costs expenses associated with maintaining inventory, including interest forgone on money invested in inventory, storage costs, taxes, and insurance

Although a flexible current asset management strategy is a low-return strategy on average, it can yield large payoffs under certain circumstances. For example, having enough cash to weather a severe credit crunch that puts a firm’s major competitors out of business can yield very large long-run returns. Similarly, having sufficient cash to take advantage of an unforeseen acquisition opportunity can be very valuable.

Restrictive Current Asset Management Strategy
A firm that follows a restrictive current asset management strategy keeps levels of current assets at a minimum. The firm invests the minimum possible in cash, marketable securities, and inventory and has strict terms of sale intended to limit credit sales and accounts receivable. A restrictive strategy is a high-risk, high-return alternative to a flexible strategy. A restrictive strategy enables the firm to invest a larger fraction of its money in higher-yielding assets. The high risk comes in the form of exposure to shortage costs, which can be either operating or financial costs.

restrictive current asset management strategy current asset management strategy that involves keeping the level of current assets at a minimum

shortage costs costs incurred because of lost production and sales or illiquidity

Operating shortage costs result from lost production and sales. If the firm does not hold enough raw materials in inventory, precious hours may be wasted by a halt in production. If the firm runs out of finished goods, sales may also be lost, and customer satisfaction may be damaged. Having restrictive credit policies, such as allowing no credit sales, will also result in lost sales. Overall, operating shortage costs can be substantial, especially if the product markets are competitive.

Financial shortage costs arise mainly from illiquidity. Firms become illiquid when unforeseen circumstances cause them to run out of cash. If bills come due, the firm can be forced to use expensive external emergency borrowing. Worse yet, if outside funding cannot be secured, the firm may default on a current liability and run the risk of being forced into bankruptcy by creditors.

The Working Capital Trade-Off
To determine the optimal management strategy for current assets, the financial manager must balance shortage costs against carrying costs. This is the working capital trade-off. If the costs of running short of working capital (shortage costs) dominate the costs of carrying extra working capital (carrying costs), a firm will move toward a more flexible policy. Alternatively, if carrying costs are greater than shortage costs, then the firm will maximize value by adopting a more restrictive strategy. Overall, management will try to find the level of current assets that minimizes the sum of the carrying costs and shortage costs.

Decision Making Example 14.1 illustrates additional applications of the concepts discussed in this section.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 14.1
Managing Working Capital

Situation

You are the CFO of Cornet Construction Supply Company, a wholesale building supplies retailer in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Cornet caters to a wide range of customers, from professional building and remodeling contractors to weekend do-it-yourself homeowners. A financial analyst for the firm has reported the following data for the working capital position of Cornet and the average working capital position of competing firms as of the end of fiscal year 2020.

 	Cornet Construction Supply	Industry Average
DSI	58 days	75 days
DSO	30 days	45 days
DPO	25 days	30 days
During the last year, Cornet realized sales growth of only 1.5 percent, while the average annual sales growth rate for other firms in the industry was 4.8 percent. Given Cornet’s relatively weak growth rate, you decide to do everything possible to improve the company’s return on assets. As part of this effort, you ask a team of financial analysts for options on how to improve the efficiency with which net working capital is used at Cornet.

Your team recommends the following three actions:

1. Reduce inventory to 50 DSI

2. Reduce receivables to 25 DSO

3. Increase payables to 30 DPO

Which, if any, of these recommendations would you choose, and why?

14.4 Accounts Receivable
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain how accounts receivable are created and managed, and compute the cost of trade credit.
We will now consider the components of the operating cycle, starting with accounts receivable, which are at the end of the cash conversion cycle (see Exhibit 14.2). Companies frequently make sales to customers on credit by delivering the goods in exchange for the promise of a future payment. The promise is an account receivable from the firm’s point of view. The amount of credit offered to various customers and the terms of the credit are important decisions for the financial manager. Offering credit can help a firm attract customers by differentiating the firm and its products from its competitors, or it might be necessary to offer credit simply to match similar offers by competitors.

Terms of Sale
Whenever a firm sells a product, the seller spells out the terms and conditions of the sale in a document called the terms of sale. The simplest alternative is cash on delivery (COD)—that is, no credit is offered. Most firms would prefer to get cash from all sales immediately on delivery, but as mentioned before, being competitive often requires offering credit.

When credit is part of the sale, the terms of sale spell out the credit agreement between the buyer and seller. The agreement specifies when the cash payment is due and the amount of any discount if early payment is made. Trade credit, which is short-term financing, is typically made with a discount for early payment rather than an explicit interest charge. For example, suppose a firm offers terms of sale of “3/10, net 40.” This firm will grant a 3 percent discount if the buyer pays the full amount of the purchase in cash within 10 days of the invoice date. Otherwise, the buyer has 40 days to pay the balance in full from the date of delivery.

In this case, the seller is offering to lend the buyer money for an additional 30 days. How expensive is it to the buyer to take advantage of this financing? To calculate the cost, we need to determine the interest rate the buyer is paying. In this case, the buyer pays 97 percent of the purchase price if it pays within 10 days. Otherwise, the buyer pays the full price within 40 days. The increase in the payment (and therefore the interest implicit in the loan) is 3/97 = 0.0309, or 3.09 percent. This is the interest for 30 days (40 days − 10 days = 30 days). To find the annual interest rate, we need to compute the effective annual interest rate (EAR), which was introduced in Section 6.4 of Chapter 6. As you recall, the EAR conversion formula accounts for the number of compounding periods and thereby annualizes the interest rate.

The formula for calculating the EAR for accounts receivable (EARR) is shown in Equation 14.4, together with the calculation for our example. Notice that to annualize the interest rate, we compound the per-period rate by the number of periods in a year, which is 12.1667 (365 days per year/30 days per period = 12.1667 periods per year).

(14.4)
By not paying on Day 10, but instead waiting until Day 40, the firm is paying an effective annual interest rate of 44.86 percent for the use of the money provided by the seller. The rate seems high, but these terms are not unusual for trade credit. Generally speaking, firms do not want to be in the short-term lending business and would prefer to be paid promptly. The terms of sale reflect this preference. If customers need short-term credit, most sellers would prefer that the customers go to firms that specialize in business lending, such as a commercial bank or commercial finance company. An important point to notice in the above example is that trade credit is a loan from the supplier and, as you can see, it can be a very costly form of credit.

Learning by Doing Application 14.2 presents one more example of an EARR calculation.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 14.2
Cost of Trade Credit

Problem

Suppose that a firm sells its goods with terms of 4/10 EOM, net 30. What is the implicit cost of the trade credit?





Another common credit term is end-of-month payment (EOM). If a firm makes several deliveries to the same customer over the course of a month, it often makes sense to send a single bill at the end of the month for the full amount. Of course, this can be combined with a discount for quick payment. For example, if the terms are “4/10 EOM, net 30,” the buyer receives a 4 percent discount for paying within 10 days of the end of the month in which the delivery was made. Otherwise, the customer has an additional 20 days in which to make the payment. We can calculate the cost of credit in this situation using Equation 14.4, just as we did in the earlier example.

How do firms determine their terms of sale? One factor is the industry in which the firm operates. For example, purchases of some consumer products, such as cars and consumer durables, involve much larger amounts of money than others. Sales of relatively expensive products can be very sensitive to the availability of credit. The manufacturers of these types of products are therefore usually liberal with their terms of sale and frequently are in the business of offering short- to medium-term financing. Ford Motor Credit Company, Ford Motors’ credit division, exists for exactly this purpose. In contrast, companies selling lower-cost perishable products, such as food companies, might ask for payment in full in less than 10 days.

The terms of sale are also affected by the customer’s creditworthiness. If the firm’s managers are confident that a customer will pay, they are far more likely to extend credit than if they have some doubt about receiving payment. If the customer is a particularly wealthy individual or a large firm or if there is a likelihood of repeat business, then extending credit may be part of the marketing effort to secure the order.

Aging Accounts Receivable
It would be nice if all customers paid their bills when they came due, but we all know that is not what happens. As a result, firms that offer sales on credit need tools to identify and monitor slow payers so that they can be prompted to pay. In credit circles, it is well documented that creditors that identify slow payers early and establish contact with them are more likely to be paid in full than those who do not monitor their receivables carefully. A tool that credit managers commonly use for this purpose is an aging schedule, which organizes the firm’s accounts receivable by their age. Its purpose is to identify and track delinquent accounts and to see that they are paid. Aging schedules are also an important financial tool for analyzing the quality of a company’s receivables. The aging schedule reveals patterns of delinquency and shows where collection efforts should be concentrated. Exhibit 14.6 shows aging schedules for three different firms.

EXHIBIT 14.6 Aging Schedule of Accounts Receivable

An aging schedule shows the breakdown of a firm’s accounts receivable by their date of sale; it tells managers how long the accounts have gone unpaid. This exhibit shows the aging schedules for three different firms: Minnow, which is extremely effective in collecting on its accounts receivable, and Rooney and Hastings, which are not performing as well.

 	      Minnow Corporation      	      Rooney, Inc.      	      Hastings Corporation      
Age of Account (days)	Value of Account	% of Total Value	Value of Account	% of Total Value	Value of Account	% of Total Value
   0–10	$436,043	60%	$363,370	50%	$319,765	44%
11–30	  290,696	40	  218,022	30	  181,685	25
31–45	              0	  0	  109,011	15	  116,278	16
46–60	              0	  0	    36,336	  5	    72,674	10
     Over 60   	              0	       0    	              0	       0    	     36,337	      5    
     Total         	$726,739	  100%	$726,739	  100%	 $726,739	  100%
The first schedule belongs to the Minnow Corporation, which is extremely effective in collecting its accounts receivable. Sixty percent of Minnow’s total accounts receivable are no more than 10 days old, and the remaining 40 percent are between 11 and 30 days old. Minnow does not have any open accounts receivable older than 30 days. Minnow’s effective DSO can be calculated as follows:

The effective DSO is simply a weighted-average measure of DSO where the weights equal the percentage of total accounts receivable outstanding in each account category.

Rooney, Inc., and Hastings Corporation are identical to Minnow in that they sell the same amount of goods for the same price and have the same terms of sale. However, neither company is able to collect all of its accounts receivable on time, which makes their aging schedules different from Minnow’s.

Rooney collects only 50 percent of its receivables in 10 days or less and 30 percent in 30 days or less. Of the remaining 20 percent, it collects 15 percent in 45 days or less and 5 percent in 60 days or less. Rooney’s effective DSO is 23.75 days [(10 days × 0.50) + (30 days × 0.30) + (45 days × 0.15) + (60 days × 0.05) = 23.75 days], compared with Minnow’s 18 days.

Things look even worse for Hastings. It collects 44 percent of its receivables in 10 days or less, 25 percent in 30 days or less, 16 percent in 45 days or less, and 10 percent in 60 days or less. As for the remaining 5 percent, they may never be collected. All we know is that these accounts receivable are over 60 days old. The worst-case scenario would be for Hastings to write these off as bad debt. Let’s assume that Hastings can collect the remaining 5 percent in a year. In that case, Hastings’s effective DSO becomes 43.35 days [(10 days × 0.44) + (30 days × 0.25) + (45 days × 0.16) + (60 days × 0.10) + (365 days × 0.05) = 43.35 days]. It takes Hastings more than twice as many days as Minnow to collect its accounts receivable.

Financial managers keep close track of both the aging schedule and the effective DSO. If either or both show consistent deterioration, it may be time to reconsider the firm’s credit policy or the characteristics of its customers. Note that in some industries, sales vary by season. Managers must be aware of seasonal patterns and make the necessary adjustments before drawing conclusions about a firm’s accounts receivable.

14.5 Inventory Management
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the trade-off between carrying costs and reorder costs, and compute the economic order quantity for a firm’s inventory orders.
We have discussed the management of accounts receivable, which represents one end of the operating cycle. We now turn to a discussion of inventory management, which starts with the purchase of raw material and extends through the sale of finished goods inventory. Inventory management is largely a function of operations management, not financial management. For that reason, we touch briefly on a few major points related to operations.

Economic Order Quantity
Manufacturing companies generally carry three types of inventory: raw materials, work in process, and finished goods. We have already discussed some of the trade-offs a firm must consider in deciding how much inventory to hold. On the one hand, as explained earlier, a firm that carries too much inventory may incur high inventory carrying costs. On the other hand, a firm that does not carry enough inventory may incur high shortage costs.

Closely related to the decision of how much inventory to hold is the decision of how much inventory to order. The more of a particular type of inventory a firm orders, the larger the firm’s inventory will be immediately after the order is received. A larger inventory means that the time before inventory must be ordered again will be greater, and so fewer orders will be required over the course of a year.

The economic order quantity (EOQ) model helps managers choose the appropriate quantity of a particular type of inventory to order. This model mathematically determines the order quantity that minimizes the total costs incurred to order and hold inventory. This model accounts for both inventory reorder costs and inventory carrying costs. Reorder costs are the fixed costs associated with ordering inventory. The trick in determining the optimal amount of inventory to order is to find the trade-off between these two costs. This trade-off exists because as a firm increases the size of its orders, the number of orders declines, and thus total reorder costs decline. However, larger order sizes increase the average inventory size, and therefore, the carrying cost of inventory increases. The optimal order size strikes the balance between these two costs.

economic order quantity (EOQ) order quantity that minimizes the total costs incurred to order and hold inventory

The EOQ model makes the following assumptions: (1) that a firm’s sales are made at a constant rate over a period, (2) that the cost of reordering inventory is a fixed cost, regardless of the number of units ordered, and (3) that inventory has carrying costs, which includes items such as the cost of space, taxes, insurance, the cost of capital invested in the inventory, and losses due to spoilage and theft. Under these assumptions, the formula for the economic order quantity is:

(14.5)
Let’s look at an example. Suppose that Best Buy sells Hewlett-Packard color printers at the rate of 2,200 units per year. The total cost of placing an order is $750, and it costs $120 per year to carry a printer in inventory. Using the EOQ formula, what is the optimal order size? Substituting the values into Equation 14.5 yields this result:

Given Best Buy’s cost structure, it should order 166 printers per order. This means that Best Buy should place about 13 orders per year (2,200 printers per year/166 printers per order = 13.25 orders per year). The EOQ formula also assumes that the firm uses up its entire inventory before the next inventory order is placed. Thus, over time, the average inventory is about 83 printers [(166 printers − 0 printers)/2 = 83 printers], with the inventory varying from a minimum of zero to a maximum of 166 printers.

The assumption of reordering inventory when it declines to zero is not very realistic. Most firms maintain a buffer or safety stock. The size of the safety stock depends on factors such as the carrying cost of inventory, seasonal sales variation, the reliability of suppliers, and the accuracy of the firm’s sales projections. In our example, suppose that Best Buy’s financial analysts determine that because of future demand uncertainty, the buffer stock should be 15 printers. In that case, the average inventory would be 98 printers (83 printers + 15 printers = 98 printers).

Learning by Doing Application 14.3 illustrates another EOQ calculation.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 14.3
Economic Order Quantity

Problem

Gator Marine and Supply, one of the largest boat dealers in the South, sells about 1,500 pontoon boats a year. The cost of placing an order with its supplier is $500, the inventory carrying costs are $100 for each boat, and the safety stock is 20 boats. As you would expect, boat sales are very seasonal; thus, all of Gator’s sales are made during a four-month period (summer and early fall). What should the average inventory be in boating season? How many orders should the firm place this year?





Just-in-Time Inventory Management
An important development in the management of raw material inventories is just-in-time inventory management, pioneered by Japanese firms such as Toyota Motor Company. Today, much of the auto industry and many other manufacturing companies have moved to just-in-time or nearly just-in-time supply delivery. In this system, based on the manufacturer’s day-by-day or even hour-by-hour needs, suppliers deliver raw materials just in time for them to be used on the production line. A firm using a just-in-time system has essentially no raw material inventory costs and no risk of obsolescence or loss to theft. On the downside, the firm is heavily dependent on its suppliers. If a supplier fails to make the needed deliveries, then production shuts down. When such systems work, they can reduce working capital requirements dramatically.

14.6 Cash Management and Budgeting
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Define cash collection time, discuss how a firm can minimize this time, and compute the economic costs and benefits of a lockbox.
Next, we turn to the cash component of working capital. While most firms hold some cash, these balances earn little or no interest in a commercial bank account. Thus, many firms also invest their cash in short-term investments consisting of very liquid stocks and bonds that are expected to be converted into cash within one year. Corporate holdings of cash and short-term investments can be quite large. For example, at the end of its fiscal year 2020, Cisco reported holdings of over $30 billion. There are a variety of reasons why firms hold cash and short-term investments. We discuss these reasons next and then cover the issue of cash collection.

Reasons for Holding Cash
There are three main reasons for holding cash. The first is to facilitate transactions. Operational activities usually require cash. Cash collections from customers generate cash inflows, whereas payments for raw materials and payments to employees and to the government generate cash outflows. Because these cash inflows and outflows often do not occur simultaneously, firms hold positive cash balances to facilitate transactions. If a firm runs out of cash, it might have to sell some of its other investments or borrow, either of which will result in the firm incurring transaction costs.

The second reason for holding cash is to ensure that the firm has sufficient cash to make it through unexpected crises or to take advantage of unexpected investment opportunties. In other words, firms might hold larger cash balances for precautionary or strategic reasons.

The third reason for holding cash is that banks often require firms to hold minimum cash balances as partial compensation for the loans and other services the banks provide. These are known as compensating balances. The bank is, in part, compensated for the loans or services it provides by getting the use of the deposits interest free.

compensating balances bank balances that firms must maintain to at least partially compensate banks for loans or services rendered

In deciding how much cash to keep on hand, managers concentrate on the transaction and precautionary motives. Once an appropriate amount of cash is determined, the manager checks to see if the amount also satisfies any compensating balance requirements set by the bank. If it does, then all is well. If not, then the firm must hold the minimum compensating balance. The compensating balance thus forms a lower boundary on the amount of cash a firm will hold.

Of course, firms may hold more cash than required by the transaction and precautionary motives. The most common explanation for why firms hold excess cash is the agency conflict we discussed in Chapter 1. Cash holdings can be used by managers to pursue their own self-interest in conflict with their stockholders. For example, managers can use excess cash to make unwise acquisitions or to invest in their own pet projects. When the interests of managers and stockholders are poorly aligned, managers have an incentive to hoard discretionary cash balances.

Cash Collection
The way in which a firm collects payments affects its cash needs. Collection time, or float, is the time between when a customer makes a payment and when the cash becomes available to the firm. Collection time can be broken down into three components. First is delivery or mailing time. When a customer mails a payment, it may take several days before that payment arrives at the firm. Second is processing delay. Once the payment is received, it must be opened, examined, accounted for, and deposited at the firm’s bank. Finally, there is a delay between the time of the deposit and the time the cash is available for withdrawal. For example, if the customer writes a check on an out-of-state (or foreign) bank, the delay may be several days while the availability of the funds is confirmed. While the use of paper checks by businesses and individuals is declining rapidly, the Federal Reserve reported that 14.5 billion checks were used in the United States during 2018, the most recent year for which the data are available.

collection time (float) the time between when a customer makes a payment and when the cash becomes available to the firm

Different forms of payment have different cash collection cycles. Cash payments made at the point of sale are the simplest, with a cash collection time of zero. If a firm takes checks or credit cards at the point of sale, then mailing time is eliminated, but processing and availability delays will still exist. Anything the firm can do to reduce the total collection time will reduce its total cash requirements, so firms spend time evaluating their cash collection procedures. A firm can reduce its total cash collection time in several ways, but as always, the firm’s ability to implement them will vary according to its industry and its customers’ expectations. A few restaurants manage to accept only cash, for example, but most find that such a policy hurts their sales.

One way a firm can reduce its collection time is through the use of lockboxes or concentration accounts. A lockbox system allows geographically dispersed customers to send their payments to a post office box close to them. For example, a New York customer would send payments to an East Coast post office box and a California customer to a West Coast post office box. The firm’s bank then processes the payments. A concentration account system replaces the post office box with a local branch of the company. The local branch receives the mailings, processes the payments, and makes the deposits. With either system, mailing time is reduced because the mailing has less distance to travel and availability delay is often reduced because the checks are more frequently drawn on local banks.

lockbox a system that allows geographically dispersed customers to send their payments to a post office box near them

Another popular means of reducing cash collection time is through the use of electronic funds transfers. Electronic payments reduce cash collection time in every phase. First, mailing time is eliminated. Second, processing time is reduced or eliminated, since no data entry is necessary. Finally, there is little or no delay in funds availability. From the firm’s point of view, electronic funds transfers offer a perfect solution. For that reason, many firms encourage (and sometimes require) their customers to pay in this way.

How much is it worth to reduce cash collection time? If a firm that has daily sales of $1 million can reduce its total collection time by even one day, then at 5 percent interest per year, the savings amount to about $50,000 per year. This is not a huge amount to a firm with $365 million in annual sales, but it is certainly worth consideration.

Learning by Doing Application 14.4 illustrates another calculation of the savings from using a lockbox.

Simon Electronics is evaluating whether a lockbox it is currently using is worth keeping. Management acknowledges that the lockbox reduces the mail float by 1.5 days and processing time by half a day. The remittances average $100,000 a day for Simon Electronics, with the average check being $1,000. The bank charges $0.30 per processed check. Assume that there are 270 business days in a year and that it costs Simon 5 percent to finance accounts receivable. Should Simon Electronics keep the lockbox?

LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe three current asset financing strategies, and discuss the main sources of short-term financing.
So far, we have been discussing the investment side of working capital management. Like other assets, working capital must be funded in some way. Financial managers can finance working capital with short-term debt, long-term debt, equity, or a mixture of all three. We next explore the main strategies used by financial managers to finance working capital, along with their benefits and costs.

Strategies for Financing Working Capital
In order to fully understand the strategies that might be used to finance working capital, it is important to recognize that some working capital needs are short term in nature and that others are long term, or permanent. As suggested earlier, the amount of working capital at a firm tends to fluctuate over time as its sales rise and fall with the business season. For example, a toy company might build up finished goods inventories in the spring and summer as it prepares to ship its products to retailers in the early fall for the holiday season. Working capital for the company will remain high through the fall as finished goods inventories are sold and converted into accounts receivable but will then decline in January as receivables are collected—at which point the seasonal pattern begins again. These fluctuations reflect seasonal working capital needs.

Even during the slowest part of the year, the typical firm will hold some inventory, have some outstanding accounts receivable, and have some cash and prepaid expenses. This minimum level of working capital can be viewed as permanent working capital in the sense that it reflects a level of working capital that will always be on the firm’s books.

Exhibit 14.7 shows three basic strategies that a firm can follow to finance its working capital and fixed assets. The wavy line in each figure indicates the total financing needed for (1) seasonal working capital needs and (2) permanent working capital and fixed assets. The wavy line is upward sloping because we are assuming that the business represented in the figures is a going concern that is growing over time. As businesses grow, they need more working capital as well as more long-term productive assets. We next discuss each of the three strategies illustrated in the exhibit.

The maturity matching strategy is shown in Figure A in Exhibit 14.7. Here, all seasonal working capital needs are funded with short-term borrowing. As the level of sales varies seasonally, short-term borrowing fluctuates with the level of seasonal working capital. Furthermore, all permanent working capital and fixed assets are funded with long-term financing. The principle underlying this strategy is very intuitive: the maturity of a liability should match the maturity of the asset that it funds. The “matching of maturities” is one of the most basic techniques used by financial managers to reduce risk when financing assets.

EXHIBIT 14.7 Working Capital Financing Strategies Three alternative strategies for financing working capital and fixed assets are (1) a maturity matching strategy, which matches the maturities of assets and the sources of funding; (2) a long-term funding strategy, which relies on long-term debt to finance both working capital and fixed assets; and (3) a short-term funding strategy, which uses short-term debt to finance all seasonal working capital needs and a portion of permanent working capital and fixed assets.


The long-term funding strategy is shown in Figure B in the exhibit. This strategy relies on long-term debt and equity to finance fixed assets, permanent working capital, and seasonal working capital. As shown, when the need for working capital is at its peak, it is funded entirely by long-term funds. As the need for working capital diminishes over the seasonal cycle and cash becomes available, the excess cash is invested in short-term money market instruments to earn interest until the funds are needed again.

Figure C shows a short-term funding strategy, whereby all seasonal working capital and a portion of the permanent working capital and fixed assets are funded with short-term debt. The benefit of using this strategy is that it can take advantage of an upward-sloping yield curve and lower a firm’s overall cost of funding. Recall from Chapter 8 that yield curves are typically upward sloping, which means that short-term borrowing costs are lower than long-term rates. The downside to this strategy is that a portion of a firm’s long-term assets must be periodically refinanced over their working lives, which can pose a significant refinancing risk (the firm might not be able to obtain new financing when it is needed). Also, as discussed in Chapter 8, the yield curve can become inverted, making short-term funds more expensive than long-term funds.

Financing Working Capital in Practice
Each working capital funding strategy has its costs and benefits. A financial manager will typically use some variation of one of the strategies discussed here to achieve his or her risk and return objectives.

Matching Maturities

Many financial managers try to match the maturities of assets and liabilities when funding the firm. That is, short-term assets are funded with short-term financing, and long-term assets are funded with long-term financing. As suggested in the discussion of the three financing strategies, managers have very sound reasons for matching assets and liabilities.

Suppose a firm buys a manufacturing plant with an estimated economic life of 15 years. If short-term rates are lower than long-term rates, short-term financing can look like a good deal. However, if the firm finances the project with short-term funds and interest rates increase substantially, the firm could find its borrowing cost skyrocketing when it refinances short-term debt at the new market interest rate. If the firm cannot pay the rising interest costs, it could be forced into bankruptcy. Even without bankruptcy, the project NPV could become negative. Managers therefore like to finance capital assets and other long-term assets with long-term debt or equity to lock in the cost of funds for the life of the project.

When they finance seasonal working capital requirements for inventory and receivables, most financial managers also prefer to match maturities of assets and liabilities by financing these investments with short-term debt. As a firm’s sales rise and fall seasonally, a financial manager can expand or contract working capital by borrowing short term when more assets are needed and, as cash becomes available, using it to pay off the short-term obligations as they mature.

Permanent Working Capital

Many financial managers prefer to fund permanent working capital with long-term funds, as shown in Figure A in Exhibit 14.7. They prefer to do this in order to limit the risks associated with a short-term financing strategy. To the extent that permanent working capital is financed with long-term funds, the ability of the firm to finance this minimum level of working capital is not subject to short-term credit market conditions.

As illustrated in Figure C of Exhibit 14.7, other managers use short-term debt to finance at least some permanent working capital requirements. These managers subject their firms to more risk in the hope that they will realize higher returns.

Sources of Short-Term Financing
Now that we have discussed working capital financing strategies, let’s turn our attention to the most important types of short-term financing instruments used in practice: accounts payable, bank loans, and commercial paper.

Accounts Payable (Trade Credit)

Accounts payable (trade credit) deserve special attention because they comprise a large portion of the current liabilities of many businesses. For example, accounts payable constitute about 35 percent of total current liabilities at publicly traded manufacturing firms. Accounts payable arise, of course, when managers do not pay for purchases with cash on delivery, but instead carry the amount owed as an account payable. If a firm orders $1,000 of a certain raw material daily and the supplier extends a 30-day credit policy, the firm will be receiving $30,000 of financing from this supplier in the form of trade credit.

We already discussed the cost of extending credit and offering discounts from the seller’s point of view. We also discussed from a buyer’s point of view that, if a discount is offered, the buyer needs to figure out whether it makes financial sense to pay early and take advantage of the discount or to wait and pay in full when the account is due. Taking advantage of a discount reduces cost of goods sold, but it also increases the amount of financing that must be raised from other sources.

Short-Term Bank Loans

Short-term bank loans are also important financing tools. They account for about 20 percent of total current liabilities for publicly traded manufacturing firms. When securing a loan, the firm and the bank negotiate the amount, the maturity, and the interest rate, as well as any binding covenants that might be included. After an agreement is reached, both parties sign the debt contract, which is sometimes referred to as a promissory note.

The firm may also have additional borrowing capacity with a bank through a line of credit. Lines of credits are advantageous because they provide easy access to additional financing without requiring a commitment to borrow unnecessary amounts. Lines of credit can be informal or formal.

An informal line of credit is a verbal agreement between the firm and the bank, allowing the firm to borrow up to an agreed-upon limit. For example, an informal credit line of $1 million for three years allows the firm to borrow up to $1 million within the three-year period. If it borrows $600,000 the first year, it will still have a limit of $400,000 for the remaining two years. The interest rate on an informal credit line depends on the borrower’s credit standing. In exchange for providing the line of credit, a bank may require that the firm hold a compensating balance.

informal line of credit a verbal agreement between a bank and a firm under which the firm can borrow an amount of money up to an agreed-on limit

We mentioned compensating balances earlier as a possible reason for firms to hold cash. In exchange for providing a line of credit (or other loan or service), a bank may require a firm to maintain a compensating balance. When required for a loan, a compensating balance represents an implicit cost that must be included in an analysis for the cost of the loan. If a bank requires a compensating balance as a condition for making a loan, the firm must keep a predetermined percentage of the loan amount in a money market account, which can pay negligible interest. If the rate of return is low, the firm is subject to opportunity costs, which make the effective borrowing rate higher than the percentage stated in the promissory note. For example, suppose Virginia City Bank requires borrowers to hold a 10 percent compensating balance in an account that pays no interest. If the Miller Corporation borrows $120,000 from Virginia City at a 9 percent stated rate, it will have to maintain a compensating balance of 0.1 × $120,000 = $12,000. Because Miller cannot use this money, the effective amount borrowed is equal to only $120,000 − $12,000 = $108,000. However, since Miller still must pay interest on the entire loan amount, the firm’s interest expense is 0.09 × $120,000 = $10,800 and the effective rate on the loan is $10,800/$108,000 = 0.1, or 10 percent, rather than 9 percent.

A formal line of credit is also known as revolving credit. Under this type of agreement, the bank has a contractual obligation to lend funds to the firm up to a preset limit. In exchange, the firm pays a yearly fee, in addition to the interest expense on the amount borrowed. The yearly fee is commonly a percentage of the unused portion of the entire credit line.

formal line of credit a contractual agreement between a bank and a firm under which the bank has a legal obligation to lend funds to the firm up to a preset limit; also known as revolving credit

We can illustrate the mechanics of a formal credit line with an example. Higgins Ltd. has a formal credit line of $20 million for five years with First Safety Bank. The interest rate on the loan is 6 percent. Under the agreement, Higgins has to pay 75 basis points (0.75 percent) on the unused amount as the yearly fee. If Higgins does not borrow at all, it will still have to pay First Safety 0.0075 × $20,000,000 = $150,000 for each year of the agreement. Suppose Higgins borrows $4 million the first day of the agreement. Then the fee drops to 0.0075 × ($20,000,000 − $4,000,000) = $120,000. Of course, Higgins will also have to pay an annual interest expense of 0.06 × $4,000,000 = $240,000. The effective interest rate on the loan for the first year is ($240,000 + $120,000)/$4,000,000 = 0.09, or 9 percent.

Another important loan characteristic is whether the loan is secured or unsecured. If the firm backs the loan with an asset, called collateral, the loan is secured; otherwise, the loan is unsecured. Firms often use current assets such as inventory or accounts receivable as collateral when borrowing short term. These types of working capital tend to be highly liquid and therefore are attractive as collateral to lenders. Secured loans allow the borrower to borrow at a lower interest rate, all else being equal. The reason is, of course, that if the borrower defaults, the lender can liquidate the collateral and use the cash generated from the sale to pay off at least part of the loan. The more valuable and liquid the asset pledged as security, the lower the interest rate on the loan.

Commercial Paper

Commercial paper is short-term debt in the form of promissory notes issued by large, financially secure firms with high credit ratings. The precise number of firms issuing these notes varies with the state of the economy. When market conditions and the economy are weak, firms of lesser credit quality are unable to borrow in the commercial paper market.

commercial paper short-term debt in the form of promissory notes issued by large, financially secure firms with high credit ratings

Most large companies sell commercial paper on a regular basis. Some large firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, transact in the market regularly—they issue their own commercial paper as a source of funds or buy the commercial paper of other firms for their short-term investment portfolios. A firm’s demand for commercial paper financing depends on the commercial paper interest rate relative to other borrowing rates and the firm’s need for short-term funds at the time.

In dollars, the commercial paper market is as large as, if not larger than, the short-term loan market. In March of 2020 the U.S. commercial paper market was approximately $1.1 trillion. The buyers of commercial paper are businesses such as banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and corporations. The maturity of commercial paper ranges from 1 day to 270 days, which is the maximum legal maturity. Most commercial paper has a maturity of less than 60 days. Commercial paper does not have an active secondary market, as nearly all investors hold commercial paper to maturity.

Commercial paper is not secured, which means that the lender does not have a claim on any specific assets of the issuer in the event of default. However, some commercial paper is backed by a credit line from a commercial bank. If the company does not have the money to pay off the paper at maturity, the bank will pay it. Therefore, the default rate on commercial paper is very low, usually resulting in an interest rate that is lower than the rate a bank would charge on a direct loan.

Accounts Receivable Financing

For medium-size and small businesses, accounts receivable financing is an important source of funds. Accounts receivable can be financed in two ways. First, a company can secure a bank loan by pledging (assigning) the firm’s accounts receivable as security. Then, if the firm fails to pay the bank loan, the bank can collect the cash shortfall from the receivables as they come due. If for some reason the assigned receivables fail to yield enough cash to pay off the bank loan, the firm is still legally liable to pay the remaining bank loan. During the pledging process, the company retains ownership of the accounts receivable.

Second, a company can sell the receivables to a factor at a discount. A factor is an individual or a financial institution, such as a bank or a business finance company, that buys accounts receivable without recourse. “Without recourse” means that once the receivables are sold, the factor bears all of the risk of collecting the money due from the receivables. The firm that sells the receivables has no further legal obligation to the factor. The advantage of selling receivables to a factor is that the firm gets money from the receivables immediately rather than waiting for them to be paid as they come due. Factoring is just a specialized type of financing. The “discount” is the factor’s compensation (in the trade, it is called a “haircut”), which typically ranges from 2 to 5 percent of the face value of the receivable sold.

factor an individual or a financial institution, such as a bank or a business finance company, that buys accounts receivable without recourse

In computing the cost of financing from a factor, it is helpful to analyze the transaction on a per-dollar basis. For example, suppose that a firm sells its accounts receivable to a factor for a 2 percent discount and that the average collection period is one month. This means that for every dollar of receivables sold to the factor today, the firm receives 98 cents today; one month later, the factor collects the one-dollar receivable. The cost to the firm of receiving the dollar one month earlier is 2 cents ($1 − $0.98 = $0.02). The monthly cost in percentage terms is $2/$98 = 0.0204, or 2.04 percent. This translates to a simple annual rate of 24.48 percent (12 months per year × 2.04 percent per month = 24.48 percent) and, from Equation 6.7, an effective annual rate (EAR) of:

This is the loan-equivalent cost of obtaining financing from the factor.

Learning by Doing Application 14.5 illustrates another EAR calculation.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Define net working capital, discuss the importance of working capital management, and compute a firm’s net working capital.

Net working capital is the difference between total current assets and total current liabilities. Working capital management refers to the decisions made regarding the use of current assets and how they are financed. The goal of working capital management is to maintain the optimal mix of current assets and liabilities that enables the firm to continue its day-to-day operations and pay its short-term debt obligations. The computation of net working capital is illustrated in Section 14.1.

2 Define the operating and cash conversion cycles, explain how are they used, and compute their values for a firm.

The operating cycle is the period starting with the receipt of raw materials and ending with the receipt of cash for finished goods made from those raw materials. It can be divided into two components: (1) days’ sales in inventory, which shows how long a firm keeps its inventory before selling it, and (2) days’ sales outstanding, which indicates how long it takes on average for the firm to collect its outstanding accounts receivable. Related to the operating cycle is the cash conversion cycle, which is the length of time between the cash outflow for materials and the cash inflow from sales. An additional measure, days’ payables outstanding, is required to calculate the cash conversion cycle. Financial managers compute these cycles to help them monitor the efficiency with which working capital is being managed. The computations are illustrated in Section 14.2.

3 Discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of pursuing (1) flexible and (2) restrictive current asset management strategies.

A flexible strategy involves maintaining relatively high levels of cash, short-term investments, and inventory, while a restrictive strategy keeps the levels of current assets relatively low. In general, a flexible strategy is thought to be low risk and low return; its downsides include low returns on current assets, potentially high inventory carrying costs, and the cost of the money necessary to provide liberal credit terms. The restrictive strategy involves higher risk and return, with higher potential financial and operating shortage costs as its major drawbacks.

4 Explain how accounts receivable are created and managed, and compute the cost of trade credit.

Accounts receivable are promises of future payment from customers that buy goods or services on credit. The details of trade credit agreements are defined in the terms of sale, which include the due date, the interest rate charged, and any discounts for early payment. The terms of sale are affected by industry practice and the creditworthiness of the customer. To manage accounts receivable, a financial manager keeps close track of both days’ sales outstanding and the aging schedule and takes necessary actions to ensure that neither goes outside the range that is acceptable to senior management.

5 Explain the trade-off between carrying costs and reorder costs, and compute the economic order quantity for a firm’s inventory orders.

The trade-off between carrying costs and reorder costs exists because as the size of a firm’s orders for materials increases, the number of orders and total reorder costs decline. At the same time, larger order sizes increase the average inventory size and, therefore, average inventory carrying costs. The economic order quantity (EOQ) calculation enables us to mathematically find the combination of the two costs that minimizes the firm’s total inventory cost. Learning by Doing Application 14.3 offers practice in computing a firm’s EOQ.

6 Define cash collection time, discuss how a firm can minimize this time, and compute the economic costs and benefits of a lockbox.

The cash collection time is the time between when a customer makes a payment and when the cash becomes available to the firm. It has three components: (1) delivery or mailing time, (2) processing delay, and (3) delay between deposit time and availability. A firm can minimize this time through lockboxes, concentration accounts, electronic funds transfers, and other methods. Learning by Doing Application 14.4 illustrates the computations necessary to decide whether a lockbox is worth keeping.

7 Describe three current asset financing strategies, and discuss the main sources of short-term financing.

Three current asset financing strategies are (1) the maturity matching strategy, which matches the maturities of assets with the maturities of liabilities; (2) the long-term funding strategy, which finances both seasonal working capital needs and long-term assets with long-term funds; and (3) the short-term funding strategy, which uses short-term debt for both seasonal working capital needs and some permanent working capital and long-term assets. Sources of short-term financing include accounts payable, short-term bank loans, lines of credit, and commercial paper.

Notes
1 Note that this is just Equation 3.2. For comparison, also note that the incremental additions to working capital (Add WC) in Equations 11.2 and 11.4 is a measure of the additional NWC that will be required to fund a project. Equation 11.4 does not include prepaid or accrued expenses because analysts do not typically forecast these items when they estimate Add WC. Prepaid and accrued expenses tend to be difficult to forecast and, to the extent that they cancel each other out in the calculation, are often quite small. All interest-bearing debt is also excluded from the calculation in Equation 11.4 because these sources of financing are either assumed to be temporary (for short-term notes) or, for current maturities of long-term debt, are assumed to be refinanced with new long-term debt and are therefore accounted for in the WACC calculation discussed in Chapter 13.
2 It is not usually in the best interest of the firm’s stockholders for managers to simply minimize the cash conversion cycle. If it were, firms would stretch out repayment of their payables and not give credit to customers. Of course, this would upset suppliers, cause the firm to incur late-payment penalties, and result in lost sales.

By any measure, the 2020 market for initial public offerings (IPOs) of stock on U.S. markets was record breaking. With over $61 billion in capital raised, IPO activity for the year was the highest on record. Perhaps the most well-known new stock issue during the year was the IPO debut of Fintech unicorn Airbnb, Inc., late in the year. Startups worth over $1 billion are referred to as unicorns because their remarkable success lends these firms an almost mythical status among investors. On December 9, 2020, the home-sharing giant listed 51.5 million of its shares for the first time on the NASDAQ exchange. While the company’s offering price to IPO investors was $68 per share, the stock price immediately shot up at the start of trade and finished the day with a closing price of $144.71—a one-day return of nearly 113 percent! With a market capitalization of well over $100 billion, Airbnb was suddenly worth more than twice as much as market leaders in the hotel industry, including Marriott International and Hilton Worldwide.

Airbnb was founded in 2008 when its co-founders decided to rent out room in their San Francisco apartment to help pay their rent. At the time of the IPO, Airbnb had grown into a giant in the multi-billion-dollar worldwide hospitality market. While Airbnb’s primary line of business featured over 7 million home rental listings, the company expanded its business model by entering the marketplace for remote work, as well as offering both in-person and remote “experiences” to its customers.

Airbnb had experienced a roller-coaster year in 2020, and its IPO almost didn’t happen. The company saw its revenue plummet nearly 80 percent at the onset of the public health crisis earlier in the year, and it borrowed $2 billion to secure its near-term liquidity. As the year ended, however, Airbnb saw an improvement in the demand for local rentals and stronger demand in the market for remote experiences. With the implementation of cost-cutting measures, the company managed to earn a profit in the third quarter. Given the stabilization of its business model, company management, along with investment banking advisors, decided that the time was right to raise capital with an equity IPO. The sale of IPO shares provided Airbnb with approximately $3.5 billion in new capital.

Founders of companies such as Airbnb are constantly thinking about how to fund their businesses. Initial financing often comes from the founders themselves and from family members and friends. However, these sources often cannot provide all of the capital that a growing company needs. As startup firms continue to grow, founders will eventually begin to sell shares of stock through private offerings to outside investors, such as angel investors and venture capitalists. Prior to its 2020 IPO, Airbnb had raised over $6 billion from private stock investors, including well-known venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital and Founders Fund. This chapter discusses how firms such as Airbnb raise capital to finance their business activities, as well as the costs and benefits associated with various public and private financing alternatives.

Chapter Preview
This chapter is about how firms raise capital so that they can acquire the productive assets needed to grow and remain profitable. To raise money, a firm can borrow, sell stock, or both. How a firm actually raises capital depends on factors such as where the firm is in its life cycle, its expected cash flows, and its risk characteristics. Management’s goal is to raise the amount of money necessary to finance the business at the lowest possible cost.

We start the chapter by examining how many new businesses acquire their first equity funding through “bootstrapping” and the role venture capitalists play in providing equity to help firms get started. Once a firm is successfully launched, management has a number of other funding options, and we discuss those options in the remainder of this chapter.

We explain how firms sell their first issue of common stock in the public markets and the work of investment banks in completing these sales. First-time equity sales are known as initial public offerings, or IPOs. We then discuss the role that private markets play in funding businesses and describe factors that managers consider when deciding between a public and a private market sale. We close the chapter with a discussion of the importance of commercial banks in providing short-term and intermediate-term financing.

15.1 Bootstrapping
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what is meant by bootstrapping when raising seed financing and why bootstrapping is important.
New business start-ups are an important factor in determining and sustaining long-term economic growth. This fact explains why state and local governments invest heavily in industrial parks, new business incubators, and technology and entrepreneurial programs at state universities and two-year colleges. Although governments can do a lot to foster new business development, they generally can do little to provide the equity capital and the initial support that new businesses need during their start-up phase.

How New Businesses Get Started
Most businesses are started by an entrepreneur who has a vision for a new business or product and a passionate belief in the concept’s viability. New businesses are seldom started in large corporations. In fact, entrepreneurs regularly leave large companies to start businesses, often using technology developed by these firms. Large companies are efficient at producing goods and services and bringing them to market, but they generally do not excel at incubating new businesses.

The entrepreneur often fleshes out his or her ideas and makes them operational through informal discussions with people whom the entrepreneur respects and trusts, such as friends and early investors. These discussions may involve issues related to technology, manufacturing, personnel, marketing, and finance. The discussions are far from glamorous. They are usually low-budget affairs that take place around a kitchen table with lots of coffee. The founder and his or her advisers often have a common bond that has drawn them together. They may have graduated from the same college, have worked for the same company, or have some fraternal or family ties.

Initial Funding of the Firm
The process by which many entrepreneurs raise seed money and obtain other resources necessary to start their businesses is often called bootstrapping. The term bootstrapping comes from the old expression “pull yourself up by your bootstraps,” which means to accomplish something on your own.

bootstrapping the process by which many entrepreneurs raise seed money and obtain other resources necessary to start their businesses

The ways in which entrepreneurs bootstrap their businesses vary greatly. The initial seed money usually comes from the entrepreneur or other founders. Until the business gets started, entrepreneurs often work regular full-time jobs. The job provides some of the cash flow needed to launch the business and to support the entrepreneur’s family (although not always in that order of priority). Other cash may come from personal savings, the sale of assets such as cars and boats, borrowing against the family home, loans from family members and friends, and loans obtained through credit cards. At this stage of business development, venture capitalists or banks are not normally willing to fund the business.

Where does the seed money go? In most cases, it is spent on developing a prototype of the product or service and a business plan. The deliverables at this stage are whatever it takes to satisfy investors that the new business concept can become a viable business and deserves their financial support.

The movie producer Spike Lee offers a classic example of bootstrapping. After graduating from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts with a master’s degree, he launched his film production company with money earned from his first feature movie, She’s Gotta Have It. The film was shot in four days to hold costs down, and most of the cast and crew were former classmates of Lee’s who worked for little or no wages. The film’s out-of-pocket cost of $125,000 was financed by credit card loans and money from family and friends. The film went on to gross $8.5 million.

15.2 Venture Capital
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the role of venture capitalists in the economy and discuss how they reduce their risk when investing in start-up businesses.
The bootstrapping period usually lasts no more than one or two years. At some point, the founders will have developed a prototype of the product and a business plan, which they use to obtain venture capital funding to grow the business.1 For most entrepreneurs, this is a critical time that determines whether they have a viable business concept that will be funded or will disband because of the lack of investor interest.

Venture capitalists are individuals or firms that help new businesses get started and provide much of their early-stage financing. Individual venture capitalists, so-called angels (or angel investors), are typically wealthy individuals who invest their own money in emerging businesses at the very early stages. In contrast, venture capital firms typically pool money from various sources to invest in new businesses. The primary sources of funds for venture capital firms include financial and insurance firms, private and public pension funds, wealthy individuals and families, corporate investments not associated with employee pensions, and endowments and foundations.

The Venture Capital Industry
Venture capitalists have always operated in the United States in one form or another. The venture capital industry, as we know it today, emerged after venture capital firms began raising capital through venture capital limited partnerships (funds) in the late 1960s. These funds revolutionized the industry, and the annual flow of capital into venture capital firms increased greatly after they first appeared. Exhibit 15.1 shows that at the end of 2019, there were 1,328 venture capital firms and 2,211 separate venture capital funds in the United States—many firms are managing more than one fund at a given time. The funds had access to an average of $189.3 million of capital. Venture capital firms invested a total of $133.4 billion in 11,359 deals during 2019, for an average of $11.7 million per deal ($133.4 billion/11,359 deals = $11.7 million).

Today, the venture capital industry employs several thousand professionals, with the biggest concentrations of firms in California, New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts. Other areas of concentration are the Research Triangle in North Carolina; Austin, Texas; and the Dulles Airport corridor near Washington, D.C. Modern venture capital firms tend to specialize in a specific line of business, such as clean energy, business software, hospitality (lodging, restaurants, and related services), or medical devices. A significant number of these firms focus on high-technology investments.

Why Venture Capital Funding Is Different
Venture capital is important because entrepreneurs have only limited access to traditional sources of funding. In general, there are three reasons why traditional sources of funding do not work for new or emerging businesses:

The high degree of risk involved. Starting a new business is a risky proposition. The fact is that most new businesses fail, and it is difficult to identify which firms will be successful. Many suppliers of capital, such as banks, pension funds, and insurance companies, are averse to undertaking high-risk investments, and much of their risk-averse behavior is mandated in regulations that restrict their conduct.
EXHIBIT 15.1 Venture Capital Industry Characteristics, 2012–2019

At the end of 2019, there were 1,328 venture capital firms and 2,211 separate venture capital funds in the United States. The funds had an average of $189.3 million of investable capital. Venture capital firms invested a total of $133.4 billion in 11,359 deals during 2019. The number of firms and funds, and the level of investment activity, increased substantially over the 2012–2019 period.

Types of productive assets. Most commercial loans are made to firms that have tangible assets, such as machinery, equipment, and physical inventory. Lenders understand the operations of these firms and their inherent risks; thus, they are comfortable making loans to them. New firms whose primary assets are often intangibles, such as patents or trade secrets, find it difficult to secure financing from traditional lending sources.
Information asymmetry problems. Recall from Chapter 1 that information asymmetry arises when one party to a transaction has knowledge that the other party does not. An entrepreneur knows more about his or her company’s prospects than a lender does. Also, when dealing with highly specialized technologies, or companies emerging in new business areas, most investors do not have the expertise to distinguish between competent and incompetent entrepreneurs. As a result, they are reluctant to invest in these firms.
For these reasons, investors such as financial and insurance firms, pension funds, endowment funds, and university foundations find it difficult to participate directly in the venture capital market. Instead, they invest in venture capital funds that specialize in identifying attractive investments in new businesses, managing those investments, and selling (exiting) them at the appropriate time.

The Venture Capital Funding Cycle
To illustrate how venture capitalists help launch new business firms, we next examine the venture capital funding cycle, which is summarized in Exhibit 15.2. You may want to refer to the exhibit from time to time as we discuss the funding cycle.

Starting a New Business—The Tuscan Pizzeria

Suppose you have been in the pizza business for several years and have developed a concept for a high-end pizzeria that you believe has the potential to grow into a national chain. The shops will have an Italian ambiance: a Tuscan facade with an Old World Italian interior decor. They will feature pizzas with all-natural ingredients that will be baked in wood-burning ovens. The interior will be designed so that customers can watch their pizzas being prepared and baked. The dough is slow rising and, after baking, is good enough to eat by itself. In addition, the pizzerias will feature panzanella salads of diced raw vegetables and Italian cold cuts, modestly priced wines, and sandwiches made from crackly loaves of bread baked in the wood-burning oven. You are planning to name your firm “The Tuscan Pizzeria.”

EXHIBIT 15.2 The Venture Capital Funding Cycle The typical venture capital funding cycle begins when the entrepreneur runs low on bootstrap financing. Venture capitalists then provide equity financing. They will later exit through a private or public sale of their equity. The duration of the cycle is typically three to seven years, and only a small percentage of new ventures make it all the way to the end.


The Business Plan

You have spent nearly six months of evenings and weekends developing a business plan. You received help from an attorney and consultants at a regional business incubator. In addition, several people who have started successful restaurants have read and commented on your plan. As a result of your efforts, your business plan is well thought out and well executed. The business plan describes what you want the business to become, why consumers will find your pizzerias attractive (the value proposition), how you are going to accomplish your objectives, and what resources you will need. You presented your finished business plan to a venture capitalist at a regional venture capital firm, and she expressed an interest in it. This is a serious inquiry, because venture capital firms receive many unsolicited business plans, but respond to very few.

First-Stage Financing

After a number of meetings with you and your management team, the venture capitalist agrees to fund the project, but only in stages, and for less than the full amount you requested. At this time, the venture capital firm is willing to fund $1.6 million of the $6 million you estimate is necessary to build a successful business. In addition, you will have to come up with $400,000 on your own. You plan to do this by using $200,000 of your own money and obtaining the remaining $200,000 from family members and key employees. Financially, you will be stretched to the limit.

How Venture Capitalists Reduce Their Risk

Venture capitalists know that only a handful of new companies will survive to become successful firms. To reduce their risk, they use a number of tactics when they invest in new ventures, including funding the ventures in stages, requiring entrepreneurs to make personal investments, syndicating investments, and maintaining in-depth knowledge about the industry in which they specialize.

Staged Funding
The key idea behind staged funding is that each stage gives the venture capitalist an opportunity to reassess the management team and the firm’s financial performance. If the performance does not meet expectations, the venture capitalists can bail out and cut their losses, or, if they still have confidence in the project, they can help management make some midcourse corrections so that the project can proceed. Companies typically go through three to seven funding stages, and each stage passed is a vote of confidence for that project. For example, each of the 19 stock offerings that Airbnb completed in the years before its IPO was one of these stages. (As you can see in Exhibit 15.2, the later stages of financing are sometimes called mezzanine financing because these investors did not get in on the ground floor.)

In our example, the $2 million ($1.6 million + $0.4 million = $2 million) with which you are starting your business makes up the first, or seed-stage, financing. It will be enough to build the prototype pizzeria, make it operational, and test the concept’s viability in the marketplace. Based on the prototype’s success, additional financing (such as the other $4 million you need) may be allocated to build two additional pizzerias and develop the operating and financial systems needed to operate a chain of Tuscan pizzerias. Later stages of financing will fund more new restaurants.

The venture capitalists’ investments give them an equity interest in the company. Typically, this is in the form of preferred stock that is convertible into common stock at the discretion of the venture capitalist. Preferred stock ensures that the venture capitalists have the most senior claim among the stockholders if the firm fails, while the conversion feature enables the venture capitalists to share in the gains if the business is successful.

Personal Investment
Venture capitalists often require the entrepreneur to make a substantial personal investment in the business. In our example, by investing $400,000 of your money and money from friends and employees, you confirm that you are confident in the business and highly motivated to make it succeed. Note that it is unlikely that the venture capitalists will allow you to pay yourself a large salary as manager of the business. They want your financial rewards to come from building a successful business, not from your salary.

Syndication
It is a common practice to syndicate seed- and early-stage venture capital investments. Syndication occurs when the originating venture capitalist sells a percentage of a deal to other venture capitalists. Syndication reduces risk in two ways. First, it increases the diversification of the originating venture capitalist’s investment portfolio, since other venture capitalists now own a portion of the deal and the originating venture capitalist has less money invested. Second, the willingness of other venture capitalists to share in the investment provides independent corroboration that the investment is a reasonable decision.

In-Depth Knowledge
Another factor that reduces risk is the typical venture capitalist’s in-depth knowledge of the industry and technology. The specialization we mentioned earlier gives the venture capitalist a comparative advantage over other investors or lenders who are generalists.

The Exit Strategy

Venture capitalists are not long-term investors in the companies they back. Typically, they stay with a new firm until it is a successful going concern, which usually takes three to seven years; then they exit by selling their equity position. Every venture capital agreement includes provisions identifying who has the authority to make critical decisions concerning the exit process. Those provisions usually include the following: (1) timing (when to exit), (2) the method of exit, and (3) what price is acceptable. Exit strategies can be controversial, because the venture capitalist and the other owners may not agree on these important details.

There are three principal ways in which venture capital firms exit venture-backed companies: selling to a strategic buyer, selling to a financial buyer, and offering stock to the public.

Strategic Buyer
A common way for venture capitalists to exit is to sell the firm’s equity to a strategic buyer in the private market. An example of a strategic buyer for The Tuscan Pizzeria would be a restaurant firm such as McDonald’s Corporation. McDonald’s might view the purchase as a strategic acquisition because one of the company’s goals is to move into the nonhamburger food market with new brands, as it did when it acquired Chipotle Mexican Grill in 2005. The strategic buyer is looking to create value through synergies between the acquisition and the firm’s existing productive assets.

Financial Buyer
Sales to financial buyers are another way for venture capitalists to exit a firm. This type of sale occurs when a financial group—often a private equity (leveraged buyout) firm—buys the new firm with the intention of holding it for a period of time, usually three to five years, and then selling it for a higher price. (Private equity firms are discussed in more detail in Section 15.6.) The difference between a strategic and a financial buyout is that a financial buyer does not expect to gain from operating or marketing synergies. In a financial sale, the firm operates independently, and the buyer focuses on creating value by improving operations as much as possible. If the firm is performing poorly, the buyer will likely bring in a new management team.

Initial Public Offering
A venture capitalist may also exit an investment by taking the company public through an initial public offering (IPO). To obtain the highest price possible in the IPO, a venture capitalist will not sell all of the shares he or she holds at the time of the IPO. Selling everything would send a bad signal to investors. Once the firm’s shares are publicly traded, however, he or she can sell the remaining shares in the public market. Exhibit 15.3 shows the number of strategic and financial sales and ventured backed IPOs of new businesses in the United States between 2006 and 2019. As you can see, the majority of venture capitalists exit through strategic and financial sales rather than IPOs.

Venture Capitalists Provide More Than Financing
A common misconception about venture capitalists is that their sole function is to provide financing for new firms. One of their most important roles is to provide advice to entrepreneurs. Because of their industry knowledge and their general knowledge about what it takes for a business to succeed, they are able to provide counsel to entrepreneurs when a business is being started and during the early period of the business’s operation. At these points in the development of a business, the people managing it (including the entrepreneur) often are long on technical skills, but short on the skills necessary to successfully manage growth.

EXHIBIT 15.3 Strategic and Financial Sales and Venture-Backed IPO Exits in the United States, 2006–2019 Comparing the number of strategic and financial (M&A) sales of new businesses with the number of venture-backed IPOs from 2006 through 2019 shows that strategic and financial sales were far more common than IPOs during this period.

The extent of the venture capitalists’ involvement in the management of a startup company depends on the experience and depth of the management team. Venture capital investors may want a seat on the board of directors. At a minimum, they will want an agreement that gives them unrestricted access to information about the firm’s operations and financial performance and the right to attend and observe any board meeting. Finally, venture capitalists will insist on a mechanism giving them the authority to assume control of the firm if its performance is poor, as well as the authority to install a new management team if necessary.

The Cost of Venture Capital Funding
The cost of venture capital funding is very high, but the high rates of return earned by venture capitalists are not unreasonable. First, venture capitalists bear a substantial amount of risk when they fund a new business. On average, for every ten businesses backed by venture capitalists, only one or two will prove successful. The winners have to cover the losses on businesses that fail. Second, venture capitalists spend a considerable amount of their time monitoring the progress of businesses they fund and intervening when a business’s management team needs help. If a venture capital–financed new business is successful, more than likely the venture capitalists will have made a substantial contribution to creating value for the other owners.

Just what returns do venture capitalists earn on their investments in new businesses? As you might expect, the annual rate of return varies substantially from year to year, and the returns earned by different venture capitalists can differ considerably. It is difficult to generalize; however, a typical venture capital fund may generate annual returns of 15 to 25 percent on the money that it invests, compared with an average annual return for the S&P 500 of 12.09 percent over the 1926 to 2019 period (see Exhibit 7.3). The bottom line is that venture capital investing involves very high risk and is not for the faint of heart.

15.3 Initial Public Offering
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of going public and compute the net proceeds from an IPO.
If a business is very successful, at some point it will outgrow the ability of private sources of equity, such as family and friends and venture capitalists, to fund its growth. More money will be needed for investments in plant and equipment, working capital, and research and development (R&D) than these sources of capital will provide. One way to raise larger sums of cash or to facilitate the exit of a venture capitalist is through an initial public offering, or IPO, of the company’s common stock.

As the name implies, an IPO is a company’s first sale of common stock in the public market. First-time stock issues are given a special name because the marketing and pricing of these issues are distinctly different from those of seasoned offerings. A seasoned public offering is a sale of securities (either stock or bonds) by a firm that already has similar publicly traded securities. The term public offering means that the securities being sold are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and, thus, can legally be sold to the public at large. Only registered securities can be sold to the public. Alternatively, securities can be sold directly to institutional investors in the private market, which we discuss in Section 15.6.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Going Public
When large sums of capital are necessary to fund a business or when the entrepreneur or venture capitalists are ready to sell some or all of their investment in a business, the entrepreneur and the venture capitalists may decide that an IPO, rather than the sale of the business to a strategic or financial buyer, is the appropriate way to achieve their goals. The decision to go public depends on an assessment of whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

Advantages of Going Public

Going public has a number of potential advantages. First, the amount of equity capital that can be raised in the public equity markets is typically larger than the amount that can be raised through private sources. There are millions of investors in public stock markets, and it is easier for firms to reach these investors through public markets. Second, after a firm has completed an IPO, additional equity capital can usually be raised through follow-on seasoned public offerings at a low cost. This is because the public markets are highly liquid and investors are willing to pay higher prices for more liquid shares of public firms than for the relatively illiquid shares of private firms. Third, going public can enable an entrepreneur to fund a growing business without giving up control. The entrepreneur does not have to sell the entire business but only what is needed to raise the necessary funds. Fourth, once a company has gone public, there is an active secondary market in which stockholders can buy and sell its shares. This enables the entrepreneur and other managers to more easily diversify their personal portfolios or to just sell shares in order to enjoy some of the rewards of having built a successful business. Of course, it also provides a way for venture capitalists to sell their shares.

Another potential advantage of having an active market for a firm’s shares is that it can make it easier for the firm to attract top management talent and to better motivate current managers. This is true because senior managers generally own equity in the firm, and some part of their compensation is tied to the firm’s stock performance. Recall that this aligns management’s behavior with the objective of maximizing stockholder value. For publicly traded companies, it is easy to offer incentives tied to stock performance because market information about the value of a share of stock is readily available. For privately held companies, market transactions are infrequent, and thus the market value of a firm’s equity must be estimated.

Disadvantages of Going Public

One disadvantage of going public is the high cost of the IPO itself. This cost is partly due to the fact that the stock is not seasoned. A seasoned stock, which is traded in a public secondary market, has an established record. Investors can observe how many shares trade on a regular basis (a measure of the liquidity for the shares) and the prices at which the trades take place. In contrast, the likely liquidity of a stock that is sold in an IPO is less well known and its value is more uncertain. For this reason, investors are less comfortable buying a stock sold in an IPO and thus will not pay as high a price for it as for a similar seasoned stock. In addition, out-of-pocket costs such as legal fees, accounting expenses, printing costs, travel expenses, SEC filing fees, consultant fees, and taxes can add substantially to the cost of an IPO.

The costs of complying with ongoing SEC disclosure requirements also represent a disadvantage of going public. Once a firm goes public, it must meet a myriad of filing and other requirements imposed by the SEC. For larger firms, these regulatory costs are not terribly important because they represent a relatively small fraction of the total equity value. However, regulatory costs can be significant for small firms.

In addition to the out-of-pocket costs of complying with SEC requirements, the transparency that results from this compliance can be costly for some firms. The requirement that firms provide the public with detailed financial statements, data on executive compensation, information about the firm’s strategic initiatives, and so forth can put the firm at a competitive disadvantage relative to private firms that are not required to disclose such information.

Finally, some investors argue that the SEC’s requirement of quarterly earnings estimates and quarterly financial statements encourages managers to focus on short-term profits rather than long-term value maximization. Managers who fail to meet their quarterly earnings projections often see their firm’s stock price drop significantly.

Building Intuition
Investors View Seasoned Securities as Less Risky Than Unseasoned Securities

Investors will pay higher prices (or accept lower yields) for seasoned stock than for otherwise similar stock from an IPO. This is true because the liquidity and value of a seasoned stock are better known. The same is true for other types of securities, such as bonds.

Investment Banking Services
To complete an IPO, a firm will need the services of investment bankers, who are experts in bringing new securities to market. From Chapter 2, recall that investment bankers provide three basic services when bringing securities to market: (1) origination, which includes giving the firm financial advice and getting the issue ready to sell; (2) underwriting, which is the risk-bearing part of investment banking; and (3) distribution, which involves reselling the securities to the public.

Smaller firms such as The Tuscan Pizzeria will probably use the full range of services provided by the investment banker because they have little or no experience in issuing new securities. In contrast, larger firms that go to the seasoned public markets on a regular basis have experienced financial staff and may complete some or all of the origination services themselves.

Identifying the investment banking firm that will manage the IPO process is an important task for the management of a firm because not all investment banks are equal. Top investment banking firms do not want to tarnish their reputation by bringing bad deals to market. Their willingness to underwrite a firm’s IPO is an implicit seal of approval. Thus, securing the services of an investment banking firm with a reputation for quality and honesty will improve the market’s receptivity and help ensure a successful IPO. Let’s walk through the steps that a business takes in bringing a common-stock IPO to market. Note that the steps are nearly the same for debt issues.

Origination
During the origination phase, the investment banker helps management determine whether the firm is ready for an IPO. That requires determining whether the management team, the firm’s historical financial performance, and the firm’s expected future performance are strong enough to merit serious consideration by sophisticated investors. If the answer to any of these questions is no, the investment banker might help the firm find private capital to see it through until all of the answers are yes. Other issues that must be decided are how much money the firm needs to raise and how many shares must be sold.

Once the decision to sell stock is made, the firm’s management must obtain a number of approvals. The firm’s board of directors must approve all security sales, and stockholder approval is required if the number of shares of stock is to be increased.

Since securities sold to the public must be registered in advance with the SEC, the first step in this process is to file a registration statement with the SEC.2 A portion of this statement, called the preliminary prospectus, contains detailed information about the type of business activities in which the firm is engaged and its financial condition, a description of the management team and their experience, a competitive analysis of the industry, a range within which the issuer expects the initial offering price for the stock to fall, the number of shares that the firm plans to sell, an explanation of how the proceeds from the IPO will be used, and a detailed discussion of the risks associated with the investment opportunity. While the SEC is reviewing the preliminary prospectus, the firm may distribute copies of it to potential investors, but by law no sales can be made from this document.

preliminary prospectus the initial registration statement filed with the SEC by a company preparing to issue securities in the public market; it contains detailed information about the issuer and the proposed issue

The information in a prospectus is designed to allow investors to make intelligent decisions about investing in a security issue and the risks associated with it. SEC approval is not an endorsement of the wisdom or desirability of making a particular investment. Approval means only that the firm has followed various rules and regulations required to issue securities and that the information is complete and accurate.

Underwriting
Once the origination work is complete, the security issue can be sold to investors. The securities can be underwritten in two ways: (1) on a firm-commitment basis or (2) on a best-effort basis.

Firm-Commitment Underwriting

In the typical underwriting arrangement, called firm-commitment underwriting, the investment banker guarantees the issuer a fixed amount of money from the stock sale. The investment banker actually buys the stock from the firm at a fixed price and then resells it to the public. The underwriter bears the risk that the resale price might be lower than the price the underwriter pays—this is called price risk. The resale price can be lower if the underwriter overestimates the value of the stock when determining how much to pay the firm or if the value of the stock declines before it is resold to the public.

firm-commitment underwriting underwriting agreement in which the underwriter purchases securities for a specified price and resells them

The investment banker’s compensation is called the underwriter’s spread. In a firm-commitment offering, the spread is the difference between the investment banker’s purchase price and the offer price. The underwriter’s spread in the vast majority of initial public stock offerings in the United States is 7 percent. However, underwriters will occasionally agree to a lower spread to compete for IPO business by high-profile issuers. For example, the spread paid in the Airbnb IPO was just over 2 percent. The spread covers the investment banker’s expenses, compensation for bearing risk, and profit. To illustrate, suppose an investment banker buys a firm’s stock for $46.50 per share and the offer price is $50.00. The gross underwriter’s spread is $3.50 per share ($50.00 − $46.50 = $3.50), or 7 percent of the offer price. If the underwriter’s total expenses for the offering are $1.50 per share, the underwriter’s net profit is $2.00 per share ($3.50 − $1.50 = $2.00).

Best-Effort Underwriting

With best-effort underwriting, the investment banking firm makes no guarantee to sell the securities at a particular price. It promises only to make its “best effort” to sell as much of the issue as possible at a certain price. In best-effort offerings, the investment banker does not bear the price risk associated with underwriting the issue, and compensation is based on the number of shares sold. Not surprisingly, most corporations issuing stock prefer firm-commitment arrangements to best-effort contracts. In fact, more than 95 percent of all underwritten offerings involve firm-commitment contracts. Best-effort offerings arise when underwriters do not want to accept the risk of guaranteeing the offering price.

Underwriting Syndicates

To share the underwriting risk and to sell a new security issue more efficiently, underwriters may combine to form a group called an underwriting syndicate. Each member of the syndicate is responsible for selling some of the securities being issued. Participating in the syndicate entitles each underwriter to receive a portion of the underwriting fee as well as a proportionate allocation of the securities to sell to its own customers.

underwriting syndicate a group of underwriters that join forces to reduce underwriting risk

To broaden the search for potential investors, underwriting syndicates may enlist other investment banking firms in a syndicate known as a selling group, which assists in the sale of the securities. These firms receive a commission for each security they sell and bear none of the risk of underwriting the issue.

Determining the Offer Price

One of the most difficult tasks faced by investment bankers is to determine the highest price at which they will be able to quickly sell all of the shares being offered and that will result in a stable secondary market for the shares. One step in determining this price is to consider the value of the firm’s expected future cash flows; the analysis and formulas used are like those presented in Chapter 9. In addition, the investment bankers will consider the stock price implied by multiples of total firm value to EBITDA or stock price to earnings per share for similar firms that are already public. Finally, the investment banker will conduct a road show in which management makes presentations about the firm and its prospects to potential investors. The road show is the key marketing and information-gathering event for an IPO. It generates interest in the offering and helps the investment banker determine the number of shares that investors are likely to purchase at different prices.

Due Diligence Meeting

Before the shares are sold, representatives from the underwriting syndicate hold a due diligence meeting with representatives of the issuer. The purpose of the meeting is to list, gather, and authenticate matters such as articles of incorporation, by-laws, patents, important contracts, and corporate minutes. In addition, the investment bankers have a final opportunity to ask management questions about the firm’s financial integrity, intended use of the proceeds, and any other issues deemed relevant to the pending security sale.

Investment bankers hold due diligence meetings to protect their reputations and to reduce the risk of investor lawsuits in the event the investment goes sour later on. The due diligence meetings are serious in that they ensure that all material issues about the firm and the offering are discovered and, subsequently, fully disclosed to investors.

Distribution
Once the due diligence process is complete, the underwriters and the issuer determine the final offer price in a pricing call. The pricing call typically takes place after the market has closed for the day. During this call, the lead underwriter (also known as the book runner because this underwriter assembles the book of orders for the offering) makes its recommendation concerning the appropriate price, and the firm’s management decides whether that price is acceptable. By either accepting or rejecting the investment banker’s recommendation, management ultimately makes the pricing decision. If management finds the price acceptable, the issuer files an amendment to the registration statement with the SEC, which contains the terms of the offering and the final prospectus. Once the securities are registered with the SEC, they can be sold to investors.

The First Day of Trading

The underwriter then typically sells the shares to investors when the market opens on the next day. The syndicate’s primary concern is to sell the securities as quickly as possible at the offer price. Speed of sale is important because the offer price reflects market conditions at the end of the previous day and these conditions can change quickly. In successful offerings, most of the securities will have been presold to investors prior to delivery, and if the issue is not entirely presold, it will be sold out within a few hours. If the securities are not sold within a few days, the underwriting syndicate disbands, and members sell the securities at whatever price they can get.

The Closing

At the closing of a firm-commitment offering, the issuing firm delivers the security certificates to the underwriter and the underwriter delivers the payment for the securities, net of the underwriting fee, to the issuer. The closing usually takes place on the third business day after trading has started.

The Proceeds
We now arrive at the bottom line: How much money do the firm and the underwriter make from the sale of the new stock? Let’s look at an example to see how to answer this question. Suppose a small manufacturing firm is doing a stock IPO with an investment banking firm on a firm-commitment basis. The firm plans to issue 2 million shares of common stock, and the gross underwriting spread is 7 percent. Following the road show, the CFO agrees to a $20-per-share offering price that has been proposed by the underwriter. Based on this information, consider the following questions:

What are the total expected proceeds from the common-stock sale?
How much money does the issuer expect to get from the offering?
What is the investment bank’s expected compensation from the offering?
The best approach to calculating these amounts is to first work through the funding allocations on a per-share basis and then compute the total dollar amounts. We know that the IPO’s offer price is $20 per share and the underwriter’s spread is 7 percent; thus, the issuer’s expected net proceeds are $18.60 per share [$20 per share − ($20 per share × 0.07) = $18.60 per share]. The total proceeds from the sale of the stock are expected to equal $40 million ($20 per share × 2 million shares = $40 million). The total proceeds will be shared by (1) the firm, with $37.2 million ($18.60 per share × 2 million shares = $37.2 million) and (2) the underwriter, with $2.8 million ($1.40 per share × 2 million shares = $2.8 million). If the syndicate sells the stock at the offering price of $20, the sale will be deemed successful, and both the underwriter and the issuer will receive their expected proceeds.

Let’s continue with our firm-commitment IPO example from the text. Suppose that the stock sale is not successful and the underwriter is able to sell the stock, on average, for only $19 per share. If the underwriter buys the stock from the issuer for $18.60, what will be the proceeds for each party from the sale?

15.4 IPO Pricing and Cost
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain why, when underwriting new security offerings, investment bankers prefer that the securities be underpriced. Compute the total cost of an IPO.
In the preceding section, we mentioned that pricing an IPO is one of the underwriter’s most difficult tasks. In this section, we discuss an important pricing issue, underpricing, and then turn once again to the costs of issuing an IPO.

The Underpricing Debate
As you might expect, tension arises between the issuer and the underwriters when the final offer price for the stock is being determined. Clearly, the issuer prefers the stock price to be as high as realistically possible. In contrast, the underwriters prefer some degree of underpricing. Underpricing is defined as offering new securities for sale at a price below their true value. The lower the offering price, the more likely the securities will sell out quickly—and the less likely the underwriters will end up with unsold inventory. Investment bankers will also argue that some underpricing helps attract long-term institutional investors who help provide stability for the stock price once the secondary market for the shares is established. Because these investors will not sell, or flip, the shares as quickly, their presence reduces price volatility.

underpricing offering new securities for sale at a price below their true value

Although the issuer and the underwriters may disagree on pricing, in reality both face potential costs if the stock price is too high or too low. On the one hand, if the stock is priced too high, the entire issue will not sell at the proposed offer price. Furthermore, there can be considerable uncertainty about what the true value of the shares is, since they have not yet traded in the public market. This uncertainty also contributes to the pressure to set a lower price. In a firm-commitment offering, the underwriters will suffer a financial loss if the offer price is set too high; under a best-effort agreement, the issuing firm will raise less money than expected.

On the other hand, if the stock is priced below its true value, the firm’s existing stockholders will experience an opportunity loss; that is, the firm will receive less money for the stock than it is worth. For this reason, underpricing is commonly referred to as “money left on the table.” In addition, if the underpricing is significant, the investment banking firm will suffer a loss of reputation for failing to price the new issue correctly and raising less money for its client than it could have. In practice, most market participants agree that some underpricing is good for both the issuer and the underwriter. However, the question of how much underpricing is appropriate is open for debate.

IPOs Are Consistently Underpriced
Data from the marketplace show that the shares sold in an IPO are typically priced between 10 and 15 percent below the price at which they close at the end of the first day of trading. This implies that underwriters tend to sell shares of stock in IPOs to investors for between 90 and 85 percent of their true market value.

The real costs of underpricing can be staggering. For example, when Airbnb went public on December 9, 2020, the company and its early investors sold 51.5 million shares of stock at a price of $68.00 per share, raising $3.5 billion in total. At the end of the first day of trading, the stock closed at $144.71 per share. This means that Airbnb stock was underpriced by $76.71 per share ($144.71 – $68.00 = $76.71). Thus, the Airbnb stock might have sold for $3.95 billion ($76.71 per share × 51.5 million shares = $3.95 billion) more. Who received this $3.95 billion of value? It went into the pockets of the new investors who bought the shares allocated by the underwriters of the IPO.

Exhibit 15.4 shows data for the number of IPOs per year and the average first-day return to investors for the years 2001–2020. The average first-day return is a measure of the amount of underpricing. The weighted average first-day return over the 2001–2020 period is about 17.2 percent, although there is considerable variation on a year-by-year basis. Notice that 2020 was the busiest year for IPOs during the last two decades. During this year, there were 163 IPO issues raising a total of $61.7 billion. This year also coincides with the highest level of underpricing, with an average first day return of 48.1 percent. Because of the underpricing, about $29.7 billion was left on the table (not received by the companies making the offerings or their selling shareholders) during 2020.

The Cost of an IPO
As we have already mentioned, the cost of going public is high. Bringing our previous discussions together, we can identify three basic costs associated with issuing stock in an IPO:

Underwriting spread. The underwriting spread is the difference between the proceeds the issuer receives and the total amount raised in the offering.
Out-of-pocket expenses. Out-of-pocket expenses include other investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting expenses, printing costs, travel expenses, SEC filing fees, consultant fees, and taxes. All of these expenses are reported in the prospectus.
Underpricing. Underpricing is typically defined as the difference between the offering price and the closing price at the end of the first day of trading in the public market. It is the opportunity loss, or money left on the table, that the issuer’s stockholders incur from selling the security below its true market value.
Exhibit 15.5 presents some market data on the cost of issuing an IPO. The first two columns show the size (value of shares sold) and number of IPOs issued during the period from 2006 to 2020. The third and fourth columns present the average underwriter’s spread and out-of-pocket expenses, respectively. These are direct costs of an IPO for an issuing firm. The last column shows the average first-day returns to investors, which represent the amount by which the issue was underpriced.

For a smaller IPO (less than $80 million), the costs associated with underpricing are relatively small; however, direct costs associated with out-of-pocket expenses and underwriter spreads comprise a much larger fraction of the total value of the issue. In deals valued at less than $10 million, for example, average underwriting spreads are 7.49 percent, and expenses are substantial at 13.51 percent of the value of the issue. In contrast, underpricing of IPOs is more pronounced for larger issues, but there are significant economies of scale in underwriting spreads and expenses.

EXHIBIT 15.5 Cost of Issuing an IPO, 2006–2020

This exhibit summarizes the costs of issuing an IPO in the United States for the period from 2006 to 2020, by the total value of the shares issued. The direct costs of an IPO for an issuing firm include the underwriting spread and out-of-pocket expenses. An additional cost for issuing firms is underpricing, represented by the average first-day return. As you can see, underwriting spreads and out-of-pocket expenses are lower for larger IPOs. Underpricing varies substantially with the value of the issuance.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 15.1
Pricing an IPO

Situation

You are the CFO of a small firm that is planning an IPO. You are meeting with your investment banker to discuss the offer price for your common-stock issue. The investment banker tells you that an IPO pricing model indicates that the current value of your stock is $20 per share. Furthermore, a firm with similar risk characteristics completed an IPO two months ago, and its stock price suggests a current market price of $21 per share. The investment banker says that the offer price should be set at $15 per share. What decision should you make with regard to the investment bank’s offer price?

15.5 General Cash Offer by a Public Company
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss the costs of bringing a general cash offer to market.
The need for funding does not end when a company goes public. Most companies continually make new investments in real assets and working capital. If they do not generate enough cash from operations to fund these investments, their managers must raise capital from outside the firm.

Managers of every business want to fund the business at the lowest possible cost. If a public firm is financially sound, the lowest-cost source of external funds is often a general cash offer, also referred to as a registered public offering. A general cash offer is a sale of debt or equity, open to all investors, by a registered public company that has previously sold stock to the public. The procedures involved in a general cash offer are summarized here. You will see that there are some similarities between these procedures and those involved in an IPO.

general cash offer a sale of debt or equity, open to all investors, by a company that has previously sold stock to the public

Type of Security and Amount to Be Raised. Management decides how much money the firm needs to raise and what type of security to issue, such as debt, common stock, or preferred stock.
Approvals. Approval is obtained from the board of directors to issue securities. If the size of a stock issue exceeds the previously authorized number of shares of common or preferred stock, approval from stockholders is required as well.
Registration Statement. The issuer files a registration statement and satisfies all of the securities laws enforced by the SEC. For a debt issue, the registration statement must contain a bond indenture that specifies the details of the issue.
Offer Price. After assessing demand, the underwriter and the issuer agree on an offer price.
Closing. At the closing of a firm-commitment offering, the issuer delivers the securities to the underwriter, and the underwriter pays for them, net of its fees. The securities are then sold to investors.
The issuer has flexibility in the method of sale and the way the securities are registered. Both of these factors can affect the issuer’s funding cost. Next we consider methods of sale and registration and discuss the costs of general cash offers.

Competitive versus Negotiated Sale
In a general cash offer, management must decide whether to sell the securities on a competitive or a negotiated basis. In a competitive sale, the issuer specifies the type and number of securities it wants to sell and hires an investment banking firm to do the origination work. Once the origination work is completed, the issuer invites underwriters to bid competitively to buy the issue.3 The investment banking firm that offers the highest price for the securities wins the bid. The winning underwriter then pays for the securities and makes them available to investors at the offer price.

In a negotiated sale, the issuer selects the underwriter at the beginning of the origination process. At that time, the scope of the work is defined, and the issuer negotiates the origination and underwriter’s fees to be charged. The issuer and underwriter then work closely together to design the issue and determine the most favorable time to take the securities to market. Following an assessment of demand, the offer price is set, and the underwriter pays the issuer for the securities and sells them to individual investors.

Comparative Costs of Funding

Which method of sale—competitive or negotiated—results in the lower funding cost for the issuing firm? This question has been hotly debated, and the results from empirical studies are mixed.

The argument for competitive bidding is straightforward: competition keeps everyone honest. That is, the greater the number of bidders, the greater the competition for the security issue, and the lower the cost to the issuer. Negotiated sales lack competition and therefore should be the more costly method of sale.

Not everyone agrees with this argument, however. Proponents of negotiated sales argue that in a negotiated sale the investment banker works closely with the issuer and thus has intimate knowledge of the firm and its problems. As a result, the investment banker is in a better position to reduce uncertainty surrounding the issue and tell the firm’s story to potential investors, resulting in a lower issue cost. Proponents also argue that negotiated sales involve potential competition. The potential competitors are the other investment banks that were not chosen to underwrite the current issue but would like to underwrite the firm’s next issue. These investment bankers will not hesitate to drop by and tell the issuer’s CFO how much better they could have done than the underwriter that was chosen. Thus, the threat of potential competition provides many of the same benefits as direct competition.

Selecting the Better Method

In the end, the better method of sale depends on the complexity of the sale and the market conditions at the time of sale. It also depends on the type of securities being offered.

For debt issues, most experts believe that competitive sales are the less costly method of selling so-called vanilla bonds when market conditions are stable. Recall from Chapter 8 that vanilla bonds are bonds with no unusual features. Their terms and conditions are standardized and well-known to market participants, and they lack complex features. These securities are like commodities because market participants understand the risks of investing in them and are comfortable buying them. In contrast, when there are complex circumstances to explain or when market conditions are unstable, negotiated sales provide the less costly method of sale for debt issues. In these situations, a negotiated sale allows the underwriter to better manage uncertainty and explain the firm’s situation, which results in the lower funding cost.

For equity securities, negotiated sales generally provide the lower-cost method of sale. Equity issues by their very nature tend to be complex, and for the reasons just mentioned, complexities are better handled when sales are negotiated. Thus, it is no surprise that virtually all equity issues, including IPOs, involve negotiated sales.

Decision Making Example 15.2 illustrates choices between competitive and negotiated sales of securities.

Shelf Registration

As mentioned earlier, the preparation of an SEC registration statement is a costly undertaking. Shelf registration allows a firm to register an inventory of securities for a two-year period. During that time, the firm can take the securities “off the shelf” and sell them as needed. Costs associated with selling the securities are reduced because only an initial registration statement is required. A shelf registration statement can cover multiple securities, and there is no penalty if authorized securities are not issued.

shelf registration a type of SEC registration that allows firms to register to sell securities over a two-year period and, during that time, take the securities “off the shelf” and sell them as needed

In addition to reducing issuance costs, corporations gain two important benefits from shelf registration. First is the greater flexibility in bringing securities to market. Securities can be taken off the shelf and sold within minutes. Thus, firms can sell their securities when market conditions are more favorable. Second, shelf registration allows firms to periodically sell small amounts of securities, raising money as it is actually needed, rather than banking a large amount of money from a single security sale and spending it over time.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 15.2
Method of Sale

Situation

You are the CFO of a firm that plans to issue a number of securities during the upcoming year. You expect market conditions to remain stable during this period. To obtain lower funding costs, which method of sale—competitive or negotiated—will you choose for the issues listed?

An issue of common stock.
A 20-year bond with a fixed-rate coupon.
A 20-year revenue bond to fund a manufacturing facility in Brazil; payment of interest and principal is tied to revenues earned by the new facility.
A 10-year fixed-rate bond sold from a shelf registration issue.


The Cost of a General Cash Offer
Even though a general cash offer is a wholesale market transaction, the cost of raising money through such an offer is not trivial. Exhibit 15.6 shows the average underwriting spread, out-of-pocket expenses, and total cost for common stock, preferred stock, and corporate bond issues of various sizes. Note that this exhibit does not include data on underpricing; total cost includes only the underwriting spread and out-of-pocket expenses.

As you can see from the exhibit, issuing common stock is the most costly alternative, and issuing corporate bonds (nonconvertible) is the least costly. For example, for a large security issue ($500 million and over), the total cost of issuing common stock is 3.63 percent of the amount raised, whereas the total cost for a corporate bond issue is 0.65 percent of the amount raised. The higher cost for the equity issues reflects the greater underwriting risk, the higher sales commissions for those involved in selling the issue, and the higher administrative expenses required to bring equity securities to market.

EXHIBIT 15.6 Average Gross Underwriting Spread and Out-of-Pocket Expenses as a Percentage of Amount Raised for Public Offerings, 1977–2001

You can see from this exhibit that issuing common stock is the most expensive method of obtaining funds, while issuing corporate bonds (debt) is the least expensive. The higher cost for the stock issues reflects the greater underwriting risk (higher sales commissions) and the higher out-of-pocket expenses required to bring equity securities to market. For all three types of securities shown—common stock, preferred stock, and bonds—there are economies of scale; as issue size increases, total issue cost, as a percent of the amount raised, declines.

Exhibit 15.6 also reveals significant economies of scale in both underwriting spreads and out-of-pocket expenses. Look at the “Total” column for common stock, for example. The cost for a small equity issue (with a principal amount of less than $10 million) is 13.63 percent of the amount raised, whereas the cost for a large equity issue ($500 million and over) is only 3.63 percent.

Finally, let’s compare this exhibit with Exhibit 15.5, which gives the costs associated with issuing an IPO. In comparing the exhibits, we need to compare the underwriting spread and out-of-pocket expenses from Exhibit 15.5 with the total costs from Exhibit 15.6, since Exhibit 15.6 includes no underpricing costs. As you can see, the direct cost of an IPO is significantly higher than the direct cost of a general cash offer of equity—even when the cost of underpricing for the IPO is not included in the total. The average total direct cost of selling a large ($500 million and over) equity IPO is 5.75 percent (5.03 + 0.72 = 5.75 percent), while the total cost for a general cash offer of the same size is 3.63 percent. This reflects the greater risk involved in underwriting an IPO and the higher cost of distributing the shares in an IPO.

15.6 Private Markets
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain why a firm that has access to the public markets might elect to raise money through a private placement.
As we have noted, the public markets for debt and equity are wholesale markets where firms can often sell securities at the lowest possible cost. For various reasons, however, firms may sometimes need—or prefer—to sell their securities in private markets. In this section, we first consider various aspects of the private securities markets and then briefly discuss private placements of equity and debt.

Private versus Public Markets
Firms that sell securities in the public markets are typically large, well-known firms with high credit quality and sustainable profits. Of course, not every firm reaches these levels of achievement. As a result, many smaller firms and firms of lower credit standing have limited access, or no access, to the public markets. Their cheapest source of external funding is often the private markets.

Market conditions also affect whether a firm can sell its securities in the public markets. When market conditions are unstable, some smaller firms that were previously able to sell securities in the public markets no longer can do so at a reasonable price. The reason is that during periods of market instability, investors seek to hold high-quality securities, and they are reluctant to purchase or hold high-risk securities in their portfolios. On Wall Street, this phenomenon is called flight to quality and refers to moving capital to the safest possible investments to protect oneself during unsettled periods in the market.

A number of large companies with high credit quality prefer to sell their securities in the private markets even though they can access public markets. Many of these private companies are owned by entrepreneurs, families, or family foundations. Two examples of large “family” businesses that avoid public markets and fund themselves privately are the Cargill Company and the Carlson Companies, both located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Such firms avoid the public markets for different reasons. Some wish to avoid the regulatory costs and transparency requirements that come with public sales of securities, as discussed in Section 15.3. Others believe that their firms have intricate business structures or complex legal or financial structures that can best be explained to a small group of sophisticated investors rather than to the public at large.

We should mention that bootstrapping and venture capital financing are part of the private market as well. We discussed these two processes at the beginning of the chapter because they are primary sources of funding for new businesses.

Private Placements
As you may recall from Chapter 2, a private placement occurs when a firm sells unregistered securities directly to investors such as insurance companies, commercial banks, or wealthy individuals. Most private placements involve the sale of debt issues, but equity issues can also be privately placed. About half of all corporate debt is sold through the private placement market.

Investment banks and money center banks often assist firms with private placements. They help the issuer locate potential buyers for their securities, put the deal together, and do the necessary origination work. They may also help negotiate the terms and price of the sale, but they do not underwrite the issue. In a traditional private placement, the issuer sells the securities directly to investors.

Private placements have a number of advantages, relative to public offerings, for certain issuers. The cost of funds, net of transaction costs, may be lower, especially for smaller firms and those with low credit ratings. Also, private lenders, because of their intimate knowledge of the firm and its management, are more willing to negotiate changes to a bond contract, if changes are needed. Furthermore, if a firm suffers financial distress, the problems are more likely to be resolved without going to a bankruptcy court. Other advantages include the speed at which private placements can be completed and flexibility in issue size. If the issuer and the investor already have a relationship, a sale can be completed in a few days, and small issues of a few million dollars are not uncommon.

The biggest drawback of private placements involves restrictions on the resale of the securities. Private placements do not have to be registered with the SEC as long as the securities are purchased for investment and not for resale. In practice, securities laws in the United States limit the sale of private placements to investors who have the capacity to evaluate the securities’ investment potential and risk. These are generally high-income investors or investors with large investment portfolios. Thus, private placement securities have limited marketability unless the firm subsequently registers the issue. To address their concern about the lack of marketability, investors in private placements require a higher yield relative to a comparable public offering or require that the firm agree to register the securities shortly after the transaction is completed.

In April 1990, the SEC adopted Rule 144A, which allows large financial institutions to trade unregistered securities among themselves. This rule dramatically improved the marketability of privately placed securities. The rule also allows issuers to sell unregistered securities to investment banking firms, which can then resell the securities to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). Since 1995, about half of all private placement deals have been conducted under Rule 144A.

Private Equity Firms
Like venture capitalists, discussed earlier, private equity firms pool money from financial and insurance firms, pension funds, individuals and families, corporations, foundations and endowments, and other sources to make investments. Unlike venture capitalists, private equity firms invest in more mature companies, and they often purchase 100 percent of a business. Private equity managers look to increase the value of the firms they acquire by closely monitoring their performance and providing better management. Once value is increased, they sell the firms for a profit. Private equity firms generally hold investments for three to five years.

While private equity firms often purchase 100 percent of a business, they also represent a potential source of capital for large public firms that have businesses—such as divisions or individual plants—that they are interested in selling. Large public firms often sell businesses when they no longer fit the firms’ strategies or when they are offered a price they cannot refuse. Selling such businesses is an alternative to selling equity or debt as a means of raising new capital.

Private equity firms establish private equity funds to make investments. These funds are usually organized as limited partnerships (or companies), which consist of (1) general partners who manage the firm’s investments and (2) limited partners who invest money in the firm, but have limited liability and are not involved in the day-to-day activities of the firm.4 As owners, the limited partners share in the income, capital gains, and tax benefits from the private equity funds. The general partners, who also invest in the funds, receive income, capital gains, and tax benefits that are proportionate to their investments. In addition, as compensation for managing the funds, general partners collect management fees and receive a percentage of the income and capital gains that are earned with the limited partners’ money.

Private equity funds have historically focused on investments in small and medium-sized firms that have stable cash flows and the potential to improve cash flows substantially. Over the last two decades, however, private equity firms have been able to raise so much capital that they have started doing larger deals. The largest private equity transaction in history involved the acquisition of a Texas utility company, TXU. The transaction had a price tag of $44 billion in 2007. In 2019, the worldwide market for private equity deals totaled about $850 billion.

Private equity investors focus on firms that have stable cash flows because the investors may use a lot of debt to finance their acquisitions. A firm must have stable positive cash flows in order to make the interest and principal payments. A private equity firm may borrow as much as $3 or $4 for every dollar it invests. By adding more debt, the private equity firm frees up its own cash, allowing it to make additional investments and increase the return on its equity investments. When a large amount of leverage is used to take over a company, the transaction is called a leveraged buyout. 5 Leveraged buyouts can add a substantial amount of financial risk to the assets acquired. For example, the 2007 acquisition of TXU was a leveraged buyout that ultimately led to the firm filing for bankruptcy protection in 2014.

How do private equity firms improve the performance of firms in which they invest? First, they make sure that the firms have the best possible management teams. Since a private equity firm typically owns 100 percent of the equity in a firm it invests in, its general it has the ability to replace the management team when necessary. Second, private equity investors closely monitor each firm’s performance and provide advice and counsel to the firm’s management team. Many of these investors have in-depth knowledge of the industries in which they invest, and some have been CEOs of similar firms. Third, private equity investors often facilitate mergers and acquisitions that help improve the competitive positions of the companies in which they invest.

Agency problems tend to be smaller in firms owned by private equity investors than in public firms. In public firms, stockholders are the owners. However, we know that it is not practical for dispersed stockholders to be actively engaged in managing the firm. Day-to-day decision-making responsibilities are delegated to the firm’s managers. Managers are stockholders’ agents and are supposed to act in the best interest of stockholders. Yet, as we discussed in Chapter 1, managers tend to pursue their own self-interest instead of the interests of stockholders. The misalignment between the owners’ best interests and the manager’s self-interest results in agency costs. Private equity funds have much lower agency costs than the average publicly held firm. Since the general partners in a private equity fund are owners and benefit greatly from the value they create, they have every incentive to act in a manner consistent with maximizing the value of limited partners’ investments.

Finally, we should note that private equity firms carry a much smaller regulatory burden and fewer financial reporting requirements than do public firms. Specifically, private equity firms are able to avoid most of the SEC’s registration and compliance costs and other regulatory burdens, such as compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Private Investments in Public Equity
As we have already noted, small and medium-sized companies can find it difficult and costly to raise money in the public markets. In these circumstances, it can be more efficient or cost effective to sell stock privately, even if the company’s stock is already publicly traded. Private investment in public equity, or PIPE, transactions are transactions in which a public company sells unregistered stock to an investor—often a hedge fund or some other institutional investor. PIPE transactions have been around for a long time, but the number of these transactions has increased greatly since the late 1990s.

In a PIPE transaction, investors purchase securities (equity or debt) directly from a publicly traded company in a private placement. The securities are virtually always sold to the investors at a discount to the price at which they would sell in the public markets. This discount compensates the buyer for limits on the marketability of these securities and, often, for being able to provide capital quickly.

Because the securities sold in a PIPE transaction are not registered with the SEC, they are restricted securities in the sense that, under federal securities law, they cannot be resold to investors in the public markets for one year unless the company registers them. As a result, as part of the PIPE contract, the company often agrees to register the restricted securities with the SEC, usually within 90 days of the PIPE closing. Once the securities are registered, they can be resold freely in the secondary markets. In the event that the issuer is unable to register the securities or the registration is delayed past a deadline date, the issuer might be required to pay the investor liquidity damages, usually 1 or 1.5 percent per month, as compensation for the loss of liquidity.

The major advantages of a PIPE transaction to issuers are that it gives them faster access to capital and a lower funding cost than a registered public offering. A PIPE transaction can be completed in a few days, whereas a typical public offering underwritten by an investment bank takes much longer. PIPE transactions involving a healthy firm can also be executed without the use of an investment bank, resulting in a cost saving of as much as 7 or 8 percent of the proceeds raised. Finally, a PIPE transaction can be the only way for a small financially distressed company to raise equity capital.

15.7 Commercial Bank Loans
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Review the common types of commercial bank loans, their terms, and how they are priced.
The previous sections have discussed long-term debt and equity funding that is obtained in private and public financial markets. Commercial banks are another important source of funds for businesses. Almost every company has a working relationship with at least one bank, and smaller companies depend on them for funding and for financial advice. A relationship with a bank can be important for a company as it can make bank loans a low-cost source of funding. In addition, relationship lenders are often more willing to renegotiate loan terms when a firm faces financial difficulties. Next, we review some of the most common types of bank loans used by businesses. Most small and medium-sized firms borrow from commercial banks on a regular basis.

Prime-Rate Loans

The most common type of business loan is a prime-rate loan. These are loans in which the borrowing rate is based on the prime rate of interest, which is historically the loan rate that banks charge their most creditworthy customers. In practice, some customers are able to borrow below the prime rate. Prime-rate loans are often used to finance working capital needs such as inventory purchases. To ensure that prime-rate borrowing is not used as long-term financing, banks often require that the loan balance be brought to zero for a short time each year.

The prime rate charged by a bank might be higher than other market borrowing rates. This is because banks provide a range of services with these loans, much as venture capitalists provide services to start-up businesses. For example, small and medium-sized firms often rely on the bank’s lending officer to serve as the firm’s financial adviser and to keep the CFO abreast of current developments and trends in financing. Thus, the cost of a prime-rate loan can include the cost of the advisory services as well as the cost of the financing.

Bank Term Loans

Term loans are defined as business loans with maturities greater than one year. Term loans are the most common form of intermediate-term financing provided by commercial banks, and there is wide variation in how these loans are structured. In general, they have maturities between one and fifteen years, but most are in the one-to-five-year range. Bank term loans may be secured or unsecured, and the funds can be used to buy inventory or to finance plant and equipment. As in all bank commercial lending, banks maintain close relationships with borrowers, and bank officers closely monitor borrower performance.

term loan a business loan with a maturity greater than one year

The Loan Pricing Model

We have mentioned that the prime rate is the rate banks historically charge their most credit worthy customers. The prime rate is not a market-determined interest rate, since bank management sets it. However, the prime rate is subject to market forces that affect the bank’s cost of funds and the rate the bank’s customers are willing to accept. Thus, as the general level of interest rates in the economy increases or decreases, bank management raises or lowers the prime rate to adjust for the bank’s cost of funds and to respond to competitive conditions.

In determining the interest rate to charge on a loan, the bank takes the prime rate plus two other factors into account. The calculation, called the bank loan pricing model, is as follows:

(15.1)
where:

      kl = the loan rate (%)

    PR = the prime rate (%)

 DRP = adjustment for default risk above the prime rate (%)

MAT = adjustment for the yield curve for term loans (%)

Before making a loan, the bank conducts a credit analysis of the customer. The first step is to determine the customer’s credit category. Banks usually have five to seven credit risk categories, which look very much like bond ratings. If the customer is of the highest credit standing, it is classified as a prime-rate customer and, thus, borrows at the prime rate (or below if it does not require substantial services). For all other customers, there is some markup above the prime rate, which is a default risk premium (DRP). For example, if a bank customer is “prime + 2,” the customer borrows at the prevailing prime rate plus 2 percent.

The second step, if the customer wants a term loan, is to adjust for the term to maturity (MAT). MAT is defined as the difference between the yield on a Treasury security with the same maturity as the term loan and the yield on a three-month Treasury bill. Mathematically, that can be expressed as follows:

MAT = yn − y3-mo

where yn is the yield on a Treasury security with n years to maturity and y3-mo is the yield on a three-month Treasury security. (As a practical matter, most financial analysts treat the prime rate as a three-month interest rate.) Suppose, for example, that a customer wants a two-year term loan. If the yield on a two-year Treasury security is 4.00 percent and the yield on a three-month Treasury is 3.70 percent, then the appropriate MAT is 0.30 percent (4.00 percent − 3.70 percent = 0.30 percent).

Let’s consider an example of credit analysis for a short-term loan, which requires consideration of only the prime rate and the DRP. Suppose a bank has two customers that are medium-sized business firms. Firm A has the bank’s highest credit standing, and Firm B’s credit standing is prime + 3. The bank prime rate is 4.25 percent. What is the appropriate loan rate for each customer, assuming the loan is not a term loan?

Firm A, with its high credit standing, is clearly a prime customer, so its borrowing rate is the prime rate, 4.25 percent. Firm B’s credit rating is prime + 3, or prime plus 3 percent, so its borrowing cost is 7.25 percent (4.25 percent + 3.00 percent = 7.25 percent). Note that the prime rate is a floating rate. Thus, if the bank raises its prime rate by 25 basis points, both firms’ borrowing costs increase by 25 basis points, firm A’s to 4.5 percent and firm B’s to 7.5 percent.

Learning by Doing Application 15.4 illustrates the pricing of a term loan.

Pricing a Term Loan

Problem

In our text example, Firm B’s borrowing cost for a short-term loan is 7.25 percent. Suppose, however, that Firm B’s CFO would like to lock in the borrowing cost for five years and asks for a quote on a five-year term loan. The lending officer has access to the following information: a three-month Treasury bill yields 1.00 percent, and five-year Treasury notes yield 2.80 percent. What loan rate should the bank quote?





Concluding Comments on Funding the Firm
This chapter has focused on how firms raise capital to fund their current operations and growth. How a firm raises capital depends on the firm’s stage in its life cycle, its expected cash flows, and its risk characteristics. For new businesses, funding comes from friends, family, credit cards, and venture capitalists. More mature firms rely heavily on (1) public markets, (2) private markets, and (3) bank loans. Each market has particular characteristics, and firms select the method of financing that provides the best combination of low-cost borrowing and favorable terms and conditions. There are no simple rules or formulas on how to fund the enterprise. Chapter 16 tackles a number of important questions regarding a firm’s capital structure and the use of financial leverage.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Explain what is meant by bootstrapping when raising seed financing and why bootstrapping is important.

Bootstrapping is the process by which many entrepreneurs raise seed money and obtain other resources necessary to start new businesses. Seed money often comes from the entrepreneur’s savings and credit cards, and from family and friends. Bootstrapping is important because business start-ups are a significant factor in determining and sustaining long-term economic growth in an economy. Many state and local governments have invested heavily in business incubators, hoping to foster new business formation.

2 Describe the role of venture capitalists in the economy and discuss how they reduce their risk when investing in start-up businesses.

Venture capitalists specialize in helping businesses get started by providing early-stage financing and management advice. Because of the high risk of investing in start-up businesses, venture capitalists finance projects in stages and often require the owners to make a significant personal investment in the firm. The owners’ equity stake signals their belief in the viability of the business and ensures that management actions are focused on building a successful business. Risk is also reduced through syndication and because of the venture capitalist’s in-depth knowledge of the industry and technology.

3 Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of going public and compute the net proceeds from an IPO.

The major advantages of entering public markets are that they provide firms with access to large quantities of money at relatively low cost, enable firms to attract and motivate good managers, and provide liquidity for existing stockholders, such as entrepreneurs, other managers, and venture capitalists. Disadvantages include the high cost of the IPO, the cost of ongoing SEC disclosure requirements, the need to disclose sensitive information, and possible incentives that focus on short-term profits rather than on long-term value maximization. Section 15.3 and Learning by Doing Applications 15.1 and 15.2 provide practice in computing net IPO proceeds.

4 Explain why, when underwriting new security offerings, investment bankers prefer that the securities be underpriced. Compute the total cost of an IPO.

When underwriting new securities, investment bankers prefer that the issue be underpriced because it increases the likelihood of a successful offering. The lower the offering price, the more likely that the securities will sell out quickly—and the less likely that the underwriters will end up with unsold inventory. Furthermore, many investment bankers will argue that some underpricing helps attract long-term institutional investors who help provide stability for the stock price.

The total cost of issuing an IPO includes three elements: (1) the underwriter’s spread; (2) out-of-pocket expenses, which include legal fees, SEC filing fees, and other expenses; and (3) the cost of underpricing. For calculations of these costs, see Section 15.4, including Learning by Doing Application 15.3. Exhibit 15.5 shows average costs for IPOs in recent years.

5 Discuss the costs of bringing a general cash offer to market.

The total cost of bringing a general cash offer to market is lower than the cost of issuing an IPO because these seasoned offerings do not include a large underpricing cost and underwriting spreads are smaller. Section 15.5 explains how to compute the total cost of a general cash offer. Some average costs are listed in Exhibit 15.6.

6 Explain why a firm that has access to the public markets might elect to raise money through a private placement.

There are a number of advantages to private placement, even for companies with access to the public markets. A private placement may be more cost-effective and can be accomplished much more quickly. In addition, some larger companies, especially those owned by entrepreneurs or families, may not wish to be exposed to the public scrutiny that comes with public sales of securities.

7 Review the common types of commercial bank loans, their terms, and how they are priced.

Most small and medium-sized firms borrow from commercial banks on a regular basis. Small and medium-sized firms may have limited access to the financial markets. For these firms, banks provide not only funds but also other services, including financial advice. For many companies, borrowing from a bank that they have a relationship with may be the lowest-cost source of funds. Furthermore, if a firm’s financial circumstances change it can be easier for the firm to borrow or renegotiate the debt with a bank than with other lenders.

Bank term loans are business loans with maturities greater than one year. Most bank term loans have maturities from one to five years, though the maturity may be as long as fifteen years. The cost of the loans depends on three factors: the prime rate, an adjustment for default risk, and an adjustment for the term to maturity.

Notes
1 A business plan is like a road map for a business. It presents the results from a strategic planning process that focuses on how the business will be developed over time. Business plans are discussed in more detail in Chapter 18.
2 There are two notable exemptions from this requirement: (1) an exemption for commercial paper with maturities up to 270 days and (2) a small-issue exemption for security issues of less than $5 million.
3 The investment banking firm that does the origination work is excluded from bidding on the issue because its intimate knowledge of the deal would be considered an unfair advantage by other bidders and thus would discourage them from bidding.
4 Limited liability companies are discussed in Chapter 1. The same forms of organization are used by venture capital funds.
5 In a leveraged buyout, a private equity firm takes over a company by using a high proportion of borrowed funds. The target company’s assets provide security for the loans taken out by the acquiring firm.


CHAPTER 16
Capital Structure Policy
CHAPTER 16
Capital Structure Policy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Describe the two Modigliani and Miller propositions, the key assumptions underlying them, and their relevance to capital structure decisions. Use Proposition 2 to calculate the return on equity.
Discuss the benefits and costs of using debt financing and calculate the value of the income tax benefit associated with debt.
Describe the trade-off and pecking order theories of capital structure choice and explain what the empirical evidence tells us about these theories.
Discuss some of the practical considerations that managers are concerned with when they choose a firm’s capital structure.
At the end of 2020, the average publicly traded firm in the U.S. technology industry had debt obligations that represented less than 12 percent of the market value of its total capital. Some well-known technology firms, such as Alphabet, Facebook, and Square, actually had much more cash than debt. In other words, these companies could have paid off all their debt and still had cash left over!

The capital structure policies at these technology firms stood in stark contrast to the corresponding policies of firms in most other industries. The average U.S. public company had debt obligations that represented about 20 percent of the market value of its total capital and were far greater than the firm’s cash balance. In fact, debt represented over 25 percent of the total capital at the average firm in a number of industries, such as building construction; air transportation; financial services (including banking); printing, publishing, and related industries; and paper and allied product manufacturers.

The capital structure policies at firms reflect trade-offs between the benefits and the costs of using debt financing. For example, on the one hand, because interest payments are deductible when a firm calculates its taxable income, the low debt levels at technology firms means that they pay higher income taxes than they would if they had more debt. At the same time, these companies have more flexibility in reacting to changing economic or industry conditions because they have the ability to borrow more money. Such flexibility can help their managers reduce the impact of economic recessions on their businesses. It can also enable them to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and to survive unexpected competitive threats.

What is apparent from the wide range of capital structures that we observe in public firms is that the appropriate capital structure for a particular firm depends on that firm’s characteristics. When it comes to capital structure policy, one size does not fit all. The appropriate mix of debt and equity financing differs across firms. Even within the same firm, it can change over time. We discuss the factors that affect a firm’s capital structure policy in this chapter.

Chapter Preview
In Chapter 15 we discussed how firms raise debt and equity capital to finance their investments. That discussion focused on individual sources of capital. In this chapter, we focus on the choice between various types of financing. In particular, we examine how a firm’s value is affected by the mix of debt and equity used to finance its investments and the factors that managers consider when choosing this mix. Managers use the concepts and tools discussed in this chapter to make financing decisions that create value for their stockholders.

We begin with a discussion of two propositions that provide valuable insights into how the choice between debt and equity financing can affect the value of a firm and its cost of equity. These insights provide a framework that we then use to examine the benefits and costs associated with using debt financing. We next describe and evaluate two theories of how managers choose the appropriate mix of debt and equity financing. Finally, we discuss some of the practical considerations that managers say influence their choices.

16.1 Capital Structure and Firm Value
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the two Modigliani and Miller propositions, the key assumptions underlying them, and their relevance to capital structure decisions. Use Proposition 2 to calculate the return on equity.
As you know, a firm’s capital structure is the mix of debt and equity used to finance its activities. This mix will always include common stock and will often include debt and preferred stock. In addition, the same firm can have different types of common stock, debt, and preferred stock. The firm may have several classes of common stock, for example, with different voting rights and, possibly, different claims on the cash flows available to stockholders. The debt at a firm can be long term or short term, secured or unsecured, convertible or not convertible into common stock, and so on. Preferred stock can be cumulative or noncumulative and convertible or not convertible into common stock.1

The fraction of the total financing that is represented by debt is a measure of the financial leverage in the firm’s capital structure. A higher fraction of debt indicates a higher degree of financial leverage. The amount of financial leverage in a firm’s capital structure is important because, as we discuss next, it affects the value of the firm.

Building Intuition
The Optimal Capital Structure Minimizes the Cost of Financing a Firm’s Activities

The optimal capital structure for a firm is the capital structure that minimizes the overall cost of financing the firm’s portfolio of projects. Minimizing the overall cost of financing the firm’s projects maximizes the value of the firm’s free cash flows.

The Optimal Capital Structure
When managers at a firm choose a capital structure, their challenge is to identify the mix of securities that minimizes the cost of financing the firm’s activities. We refer to this mix as the optimal capital structure because the capital structure that minimizes the cost of financing the firm’s projects is also the capital structure that maximizes the total value of those projects and, therefore, the overall value of the firm.

optimal capital structure the capital structure that minimizes the cost of financing a firm’s projects and thus maximizes the value of the firm

You can see why the optimal capital structure maximizes the value of the firm if you think back to our discussions of NPV analysis for a single project. Recall that the incremental after-tax free cash flows we discount in an NPV analysis are not affected by the way a project is financed. There is no interest or principal payment in Equation 11.2:

Recall also that the discount rate, or weighted average cost of capital (WACC), for a project accounts for the way that it is financed. The lower the cost of financing a project, the lower the discount rate and, therefore, the larger the present value of the free cash flows. This same idea applies for the total portfolio of projects in a firm. If the overall cost of financing those projects is lower, the present value of the total free cash flows they produce is larger.

The Modigliani and Miller Propositions
To understand what determines the optimal capital structure for a particular firm, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms through which financing decisions affect financing costs. The Modigliani and Miller (M&M) propositions provide essential insights into these mechanisms. These propositions, originally developed by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller more than 50 years ago, are still very relevant today.2 We discuss them in this section and explore their implications throughout much of this chapter.

M&M Proposition 1

Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition 1, which we will denote as M&M Proposition 1, states that the capital structure decisions a firm makes will have no effect on the value of the firm if (1) there are no taxes, (2) there are no information or transaction costs, and (3) the real investment policy of the firm is not affected by its capital structure decisions. The real investment policy of the firm includes the criteria it uses in deciding which real assets (projects) to invest in. A policy to invest in all positive NPV projects is an example of a real investment policy. We will discuss each of the three conditions in detail later, but let’s first discuss the intuition behind M&M Proposition 1.

real investment policy the policy relating to the criteria the firm uses in deciding which real assets (projects) to invest in

Assume that a firm pays no taxes and that the present value of the free cash flows produced by the assets of the firm can be represented as a pie that is divided between the stockholders and the debt holders, as illustrated in Exhibit 16.1. The slice of the pie labeled VEquity represents the value of the cash flows to be received by the stockholders, and the slice labeled VDebt represents the value to be received by the debt holders.

EXHIBIT 16.1 Capital Structure and Firm Value under M&M Proposition 1 The size of the pie represents the present value of the free cash flows that the assets of a firm are expected to produce in the future (VFirm). The sizes of the slices reflect the value of the total cash flows that the debt holders (VDebt) or stockholders (VEquity) are entitled to receive for three different capital structures. Under the three conditions identified by M&M, the total value of the cash flows to the debt holders and stockholders does not change, regardless of which capital structure the firm uses.


From the discussion of the finance balance sheet in Chapter 13, we know that the market value of the debt plus the market value of the equity must equal the market value of the cash flows produced by the firm’s assets (VAssets). In practice, we also refer to VAssets as the firm value or the firm’s enterprise value (VFirm), which means that we can write Equation 13.1 as:

firm value, or enterprise value the total value of the firm’s assets; it equals the value of the equity financing plus the value of the debt financing used by the firm

(16.1)
M&M Proposition 1 says that if the size of the pie (representing the present value of the free cash flows the firm’s assets are expected to produce in the future) is fixed, and no one other than the stockholders and the debt holders is getting a slice of the pie, then the combined value of the equity and debt claims does not change when you change the capital structure. You can see this in Exhibit 16.1, where each of the three pies represents a different capital structure. No matter how you slice the pie, the total value of the debt plus the equity remains the same. If the three conditions specified by M&M hold, the capital structure of the firm specifies how that pie is to be sliced, but it does not change the overall size of the pie or the combined size of the debt and equity slices.

Building Intuition
Capital Structure Choices Do Not Affect Firm Value If They Do Not Affect the Value of the Free Cash Flows to Investors

Capital structure choices will not affect a firm’s value if all of the following three conditions exist: (1) there are no taxes, (2) there are no information or transaction costs, and (3) the way in which the firm is financed does not affect its real investment policy. This is M&M Proposition 1.

Understanding M&M Proposition 1
To help you better understand M&M Proposition 1, let’s consider its implications in the context of an example. Assume that the three conditions identified by M&M apply and consider a company, Millennium Motors, that is financed entirely with equity. Millennium Motors produces annual cash flows of $100, which are expected to continue forever. If the appropriate discount rate for Millennium’s cash flows is 10 percent, we can use the perpetuity model, Equation 6.3, to calculate the value of the firm:

Since the firm is financed entirely with equity, the equity is also worth $1,000. Suppose that the management of Millennium Motors is considering changing its capital structure from $1,000 (100 percent) equity to $800 (80 percent) equity and $200 (20 percent) debt. The company would accomplish this change by selling $200 worth of perpetual bonds and paying the $200 to stockholders through a one-time special dividend.

The change that Millennium is contemplating is an example of a financial restructuring. A financial restructuring is a combination of financial transactions that changes the capital structure of the firm without affecting its real assets. These transactions might involve issuing debt and using the proceeds to repurchase stock or to pay a dividend, or selling stock and using the proceeds to repay debt. No new money is actually being invested in the firm.

Now suppose that you are currently the only investor in Millennium—you own 100 percent of the outstanding stock—and that the firm would have to pay 5 percent interest on the debt after the restructuring. If the restructuring took place, you would immediately receive a $200 special dividend. After that, each year you would be entitled to the $90 that is left over after the $10 interest payment on the bonds.3

M&M showed that if you, as an investor, decide that you do not like the effect the restructuring would have on your cash flows, management could go ahead with the restructuring and you could undo its effect on the cash flows you receive by making offsetting trades in your personal investment account. To undo the effects of Millennium’s proposed financial restructuring, you would simply use the entire $200 special dividend to buy all of the perpetual bonds the firm issues. From that point forward, you would receive the first $10 that the firm earns each year as an interest payment on your bonds. In addition, you would receive any remaining cash flows because you would still own 100 percent of the stock. Just as before the restructuring, you would be receiving all of the cash flows generated by the firm. Only now, instead of receiving all of those cash flows as dividends, you would receive some cash in the form of interest payments.

What if Millennium Motors had more than one stockholder? It wouldn’t matter—the result would be the same. For instance, if you owned only 10 percent of the firm’s equity before the restructuring, you could still undo the change by using your special dividend to purchase 10 percent of the bonds. You would receive the same cash flows after the restructuring as you did before.

Furthermore, M&M Proposition 1 suggests that transactions such as those we have described need not be used to undo a financial restructuring that the firm undertakes—investors can also use them to create their own restructuring. For example, as before, suppose you own 100 percent of the stock in Millennium Motors. This time, however, let’s assume that management has no intention of adding debt to the firm’s capital structure, but that you wish they would. You would like management to alter the capital structure so that it would include 80 percent equity and 20 percent debt and pay you a $200 special dividend.

You could easily produce the same effect by making trades in your investment account that would alter your cash flows. You could borrow $200 at a 5 percent interest rate and pay the interest on the debt out of the annual cash flows you receive from the company. Of course, in order for this transaction to exactly duplicate a similar restructuring by the firm, you would have to be able to borrow at the same interest rate as the firm.4 If you borrowed at the same rate, your cash flows would be exactly the same as if Millennium Motors had borrowed the money and paid you the special dividend. You would receive $200 from the loan today, and you would have $90 left over each year after you paid interest on that loan.

Learning by Doing Application 16.1 illustrates another example of how an investor can undo the effects of a financial restructuring.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 16.1
Undoing the Effects of a Financial Restructuring on Your Own

Problem

You own 5 percent of the stock in a company that is financed with 80 percent equity and 20 percent debt. Like Millennium Motors, the company generates cash flows of $100 per year before any interest payments and has a total value of $1,000. Management has announced plans to increase the proportion of debt in the firm’s capital structure from 20 percent to 30 percent by borrowing $100 and paying a special dividend equal to that amount. Assume that the interest rate on debt is 5 percent regardless of how much debt the company has. How can you undo the effect of the financial restructuring on the cash flows that you receive in your personal account? Show that when you do this, your cash flows after the restructuring are the same as they were before.





Conclusion from M&M Proposition 1
As our examples illustrate, in perfect financial markets—markets in which the three conditions specified in M&M Proposition 1 hold—investors can make changes in their own investment accounts that will replicate the cash flows for any capital structure that the firm’s management might choose or that they might desire. Since investors can do this on their own, they are not willing to pay more for the stock of a firm that does it for them. Therefore, the value of the firm will be the same regardless of its capital structure. This is true because changes in capital structure will not change the total value of the claims that debt holders and stockholders have on the cash flows—which is the point of M&M Proposition 1 and is illustrated in the pie diagrams of Exhibit 16.1.

M&M Proposition 2

Under the three conditions outlined in M&M Proposition 1, a firm’s capital structure does not affect the value of the firm’s real assets. That’s because capital structure decisions do not affect the level, timing, or risk of the cash flows produced by those assets. Although the risk of the cash flows produced by the assets does not change with changes in the firm’s capital structure, the risk of the equity claims on those cash flows—and therefore the required return on equity—does change. M&M’s Proposition 2 states that the cost of (required return on) a firm’s common stock is directly related to the debt-to-equity ratio.5 To see why, let’s return to the WACC formula, Equation 13.7:

If there are no taxes, as M&M Proposition 1 assumes, then t = 0 and Equation 13.7 is:

Furthermore, if we assume (for simplicity) that the firm has no preferred stock, then this equation can be simplified further:

(16.2)
where xDebt + xcs = 1.

Since, under the M&M Proposition 1 conditions, capital structure choices do not affect the risk of the cash flows produced by a firm’s assets, the WACC does not change with the firm’s capital structure. The reason is that, as a weighted average of the cost of debt and the cost of equity, the WACC reflects the riskiness of the cash flows generated by the firm’s assets (kAssets). Now if we recognize that the proportions of debt and equity in the firm’s capital structure are calculated as:

and

where VDebt is the dollar value of the debt and Vcs is the dollar value of the common stock, we can write Equation 16.2 as follows:

Finally, using some algebra, we can rearrange this equation to solve for k cs in terms of kAssets and kDebt. We find that:

(16.3)
Equation 16.3 is M&M’s Proposition 2, which shows that the cost of (required return on) a firm’s common stock is directly related to the debt-to-equity ratio. You can see this in the equation by noting that as the ratio VDebt /Vcs increases on the right-hand side, kcs will increase on the left-hand side. We have demonstrated this relation assuming that a firm has only common stock outstanding. However, you can rest assured that it also holds if the firm also has preferred stock outstanding.6

Building Intuition
The Cost of Equity Increases with Financial Leverage

The required rate of return on a firm’s equity (cost of equity) increases as its debt-to-equity ratio increases. This is M&M Proposition 2.

Understanding M&M Proposition 2
We can think of the two terms on the right-hand side of Equation 16.3 as reflecting two sources of risk in the cash flows to which stockholders have a claim. The first source of risk is the underlying risk of the assets. This risk is reflected in the required return on the firm’s assets (kAssets) and is known as the business risk of the firm. It is the risk associated with the characteristics of the firm’s assets (projects).

business risk the risk in the cash flows to stockholders that is associated with uncertainty due to the characteristics of the firm’s assets

The second source of risk, which is reflected in the second term, is the capital structure of the firm. The capital structure determines the financial risk, which reflects the effect that financing decisions have on the riskiness of the cash flows that the stockholders will receive. The more debt financing a firm uses, the greater the financial risk. As you know from our earlier discussions, debt holders have the first claim on the cash flows produced by the assets. Interest and principal payments must be made before any cash can be distributed to the stockholders. Therefore, the larger the proportion of debt in a firm’s capital structure, the larger the interest and principal payments, and the greater the uncertainty associated with the cash flows to which the stockholders have a claim.

financial risk the risk in the cash flows to stockholders that is due to the way in which the firm’s assets have been financed

If we assume that a firm’s net income is a reasonable measure of the cash flows to which stockholders have a claim, then we can use the simple income statement in Exhibit 16.2 to illustrate the distinction between business and financial risk.7 The exhibit shows that business risk is associated with the operations of the business. If you think of business risk as the systematic risk associated with operating profits, and you recall the discussion of operating leverage in Chapter 12, you can see that a firm’s business risk reflects the systematic variation in (1) unit sales, (2) unit prices, (3) the costs of producing and selling the firm’s products, and (4) the degree of operating leverage in the production process.8 Financial risk, in contrast, is associated with required payments to a firm’s lenders. The total risk of the cash flows that the stockholders have a claim to depends on both the business risk and the financial risk.

EXHIBIT 16.2 Relations between Business Risk, Financial Risk, and Total Equity Risk

The total risk associated with the cash flows that stockholders are entitled to receive reflects the risk related to the firm’s assets (business risk) and the risk related to the way those assets are financed (financial risk). (We assume here that net income is a reasonable measure of these cash flows.)

EXHIBIT 16.3 Illustration of Relations between Business Risk, Financial Risk, and Total Risk

The exhibit shows how a decrease in revenue affects net income (total equity risk) for four different combinations of debt financing (financial risk) and operating leverage (business risk). In columns 1 and 2, we see the effect on a firm with no debt and low operating leverage; in columns 3 and 4, no debt and high operating leverage; in columns 5 and 6, debt and low operating leverage; and in columns 7 and 8, debt and high operating leverage. As you can see, total equity risk, represented by the percent drop in net income, is greater when operating leverage is higher (for example, compare columns 1 and 2 with columns 3 and 4) and when a firm has financial risk (for example, compare columns 1 and 2 with columns 5 and 6). Furthermore, financial risk magnifies operating risk (for example, compare columns 3 and 4 with columns 7 and 8).

Percent change in net income		−32%		−56%	 		−80%		−140%
The numerical example in Exhibit 16.3 illustrates the distinction between business risk and financial risk and shows how they combine to determine total equity risk. Consider a firm that sells recreational vehicles and that has the income statement illustrated in column 1. The firm has $100 in revenue; costs of goods sold of $60; and selling, general, and administrative expenses of $15. If we assume that costs of goods sold are all variable costs (VC) and that selling, general, and administrative expenses are all fixed costs (FC), 80 percent [$60/($60 + $15) = 0.80, or 80 percent] of the total costs at this firm are variable costs and 20 percent [$15/($60 + $15) = 0.20, or 20 percent] are fixed. This cost structure, combined with variation in unit sales, the unit pricing, and the costs of producing and selling the firm’s products, determines the business risk of the firm. Looking farther down the income statement in column 1, we can see that the firm has no interest expense, which means that it has no debt. In other words, this firm has no leverage and therefore no financial risk.

Now suppose that the price of gasoline increases significantly, causing a drop in the demand for recreational vehicles and a 20 percent decline in revenue, from $100 to $80. Column 2 in Exhibit 16.3 shows that net income would decline to $12.24 (you should verify this calculation), which is a 32 percent decrease [($12.24 − $18.00)/$18.00 = −0.32, or −32 percent] from the net income in column 1. Since the firm has no debt, and we are assuming that the only change in costs is the reduction in variable costs that occurs when fewer units are sold, this change reflects only the decrease in revenue and the operating leverage of the firm.

If the firm had greater operating leverage, the decline in net income would be even larger. For example, in columns 3 and 4, we show the income statements for a company that has fixed costs representing only 60 percent [$45/($30 + $45) = 0.60, or 60 percent] of total costs and that has no debt. In this case, a 20 percent decline in net revenue results in a 56 percent [($7.92 − $18.00)/$18.00 = −0.56, or −56 percent] decline in net income, illustrating how greater operating leverage magnifies changes in revenue even more.

Next, consider a firm with the income statement presented in column 5. This firm is exactly like the one in column 1 except that it uses some debt financing. You can see that it has an annual interest expense of $15. If revenue drops by 20 percent, the net income of the firm in column 5 will drop by 80 percent [($1.44 − $7.20)/$7.20 = −0.80, or −80 percent]. Thirty-two percent of the decline is due to the nature of the business (remember that it is just like the business in columns 1 and 2), and the remaining 48 percent is due to the use of debt financing. The financial risk magnifies the effect of the operating leverage on net income.

Columns 7 and 8 show that if a firm with the same cost structure as the firm in column 3 had to make a $15 interest payment, the decline in net income would increase from 56 percent to 140 percent—a difference of 84 percent! The examples in columns 5 through 8 illustrate why the proportion of debt in a firm’s capital structure is called financial leverage.9 Just as fixed operating costs create operating leverage, fixed-interest costs create financial leverage, which magnifies the effect of changes in revenue on the bottom line of the income statement. This is why the risk and, as M&M told us in their Proposition 2, the cost of common stock increases with financial leverage.

Using M&M Proposition 2 to Calculate the Return on Equity
M&M Proposition 2 can be used to calculate the cost of common stock following a financial restructuring. To see how this is done, let’s return to the Millennium Motors example.

Before the restructuring, the return on equity for Millennium Motors was the same as the return on assets, 10 percent. We know this because the firm used 100 percent equity financing, which means that the stockholders received all of the cash flows produced by the assets.

After the proposed restructuring, however, the firm would be financed with 20 percent debt and 80 percent common equity. The return on assets would still be 10 percent, and as noted earlier, the return on the debt would be 5 percent. From Equation 16.3, we know that the cost of equity will be:

The financial restructuring would increase the cost of equity from 10 percent to 11.25 percent.

Note, too, that if you (as the only investor in Millennium Motors) had offset the effect of the restructuring by using the $200 special dividend to purchase all of the bonds, then the expected return on your combined portfolio would be (0.2 × 0.05) + (0.8 × 0.1125) = 0.10, or 10 percent, just as it was before the restructuring. Again, the restructuring would not change the riskiness of the firm’s real assets or the value of those assets.

Learning by Doing Application 16.2, on the next page, presents another example of calculating the cost of common stock using M&M Proposition 2.

How the Costs of Assets, Debt, and Equity Change with Leverage
Exhibit 16.4 illustrates M&M Proposition 2 by plotting the cost of common stock (kcs) against the debt-to-equity ratio. Recall from Equation 16.3 that kcs equals kAssets if the firm uses no debt financing (VDebt /Vcs = 0) and has no preferred stock. In Figure A of the exhibit, you can see that these costs both equal 10 percent if the firm has no leverage in this example. Equation 16.3 also tells us that as the debt-to-equity ratio increases from zero, the cost of equity will increase by (VDebt /Vcs)(kAssets − kDebt). This increase is illustrated by the blue upward-sloping line.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 16.2
Using M&M Proposition 2 to Calculate kcs

Problem

The required rate of return on the assets of Tempe Technologies is 8 percent, the firm has a debt-to-common-stock ratio of 30 percent, and the cost of debt is 5 percent. If the firm has no preferred stock and the three conditions specified by M&M hold, what is the expected rate of return on the firm’s common stock?





EXHIBIT 16.4 Illustrations of M&M Proposition 2 The costs of assets, common stock, and debt for different debt-to-equity ratios. Figure A assumes that the cost of debt remains constant, and Figure B assumes that the cost of debt increases with leverage. The cost of assets, which is the return that investors require to compensate them for business risk, does not change with leverage. As M&M Proposition 2 tells us, the cost of common stock increases with leverage.


Figure A in Exhibit 16.4 assumes that the cost of debt will remain 5 percent regardless of the amount of debt financing that the firm uses. Figure B in the exhibit shows a more realistic plot of how the costs of assets, debt, and equity change with the debt-to-equity ratio. The key things to understand about the plot in Figure B are that (1) both the cost of debt and the cost of equity increase as the debt-to-equity ratio increases and (2) the cost of debt increases at an increasing rate. We explain why the cost of debt increases as it does in the next section.

What the M&M Propositions Tell Us

M&M provided elegant analyses of how capital structure choices are related to firm value and how financial leverage affects the cost of equity. They recognized, however, that the three conditions underlying their analyses are unrealistic. Firms do pay taxes, there are information and transaction costs, and as you will see soon, financing decisions do affect the real investment policies of firms. The value of the M&M analysis is that it tells us exactly where we should look if we want to understand how capital structure affects firm value and the cost of equity. If financial policy matters, it must be because (1) taxes matter, (2) information or transaction costs matter, or (3) capital structure choices affect a firm’s real investment policy. We discuss each of these possibilities in the next section.

16.2 The Benefits and Costs of Using Debt
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss the benefits and costs of using debt financing and calculate the value of the income tax benefit associated with debt.
There are both benefits and costs associated with using debt to finance the purchase of assets. Studies suggest that for very low levels of debt (relative to equity), the marginal benefits of adding more debt outweigh the marginal costs, and the use of more debt reduces the firm’s WACC. However, as the amount of debt in the firm’s capital structure increases, the marginal costs become greater and eventually begin to outweigh the marginal benefits. The point at which the marginal costs just equal the marginal benefits is the point at which the WACC is minimized. Understanding the location of this point requires an understanding of the costs and benefits and how they change with the amount of debt used by a firm. In this section, we use the framework provided by the three M&M conditions to discuss the benefits and costs of debt.

The Benefits of Debt
We have noted that including debt in the capital structure has advantages for a firm. We now discuss these benefits in detail.

Interest Tax Shield Benefit

The most important benefit from including debt in a firm’s capital structure stems from the fact that, as we discussed in Chapter 13, firms can deduct interest payments for tax purposes, but cannot deduct dividend payments.10 This makes it less costly to distribute cash to investors through interest payments than through dividends.

To understand the implications of the tax deductibility of interest payments for firm value, let’s return to the pie analogy in Exhibit 16.1. If we relax the M&M assumption that firms pay no taxes, while assuming that the other two M&M conditions still apply, the pie is now cut into three slices instead of two. In addition to the slices for debt holders and stockholders, there is now a tax slice for the government.

Exhibit 16.5 illustrates the new situation. As shown in the pie on the left, if the firm is financed entirely with equity, there is no interest expense, the firm pays taxes on all of the income from operations, and the value of the firm equals the present value of the after-tax cash flows that the stockholders have a right to receive. Now if the firm uses debt, some of the income from operations will be tax deductible, and the tax slice—the present value of the taxes the firm must pay—will be smaller than in the first pie. This is illustrated for one level of debt in the second pie and for an even greater level of debt in the third pie. Note that the value of the firm, which equals the combined values of the debt and equity slices, increases as the tax slice gets smaller.

Just how large is the value of the interest tax shield? Suppose a firm has fixed perpetual debt equal to D dollars, on which it pays an annual interest rate of kDebt. The total dollar amount of interest paid each year—and, therefore, the amount that will be deducted from the firm’s taxable income—is D × kDebt. This will result in a reduction in taxes paid of D × kDebt × t, where t is the firm’s marginal tax rate that applies to the interest expense deduction.

To put this tax reduction in perspective, consider a firm that has no debt and annual earnings before interest and taxes, EBIT, of $100, which is expected to remain constant in perpetuity. Because the firm has no debt, it currently pays taxes equal to 28 percent of EBIT. Management is considering borrowing $1,000 at an interest rate of 5 percent. If the firm borrows the money, it will thus pay interest of $50 each year.

EXHIBIT 16.5 Capital Structure and Firm Value with Taxes Leverage can increase the value of a firm when interest payments are tax deductible but dividend payments are not. The pie on the left represents a firm financed entirely with equity. The slice labeled VTaxes 1 reflects the proportion of the cash flows from operations that this firm pays in taxes. The two pies to the right illustrate how the value of the cash flows paid in taxes decreases as leverage is increased. By reducing the fraction paid in taxes, leverage increases the value of the firm in these examples.


The after-tax earnings for the firm without the debt equal $72 [$100 × (1 − 0.28) = $72], and the taxes paid by the firm equal $28 ($100 × 0.28 = $28). If the firm borrows the $1,000, its after-tax earnings will be $36 [($100 − $50) × (1 − 0.28) = $36], and it will pay taxes of $14 [($100 − $50) × 0.28 = $14]. The new debt will reduce the taxes that the firm pays each year by $14 (D × k Debt × t = $1,000 × 0.05 × 0.28 = $14). The total cash flows to the government, the stockholders, and the debt holders in each situation are as follows:

No Debt	After $1,000 Loan
Government (taxes)	$ 28.00	$ 14.00
Stockholders	   72.00	   36.00
Debt holders	     0.00	   50.00
Total	$100.00	$100.00
How much is the reduction in taxes worth? If we assume the annual dollar value of the tax reduction will continue in perpetuity, we can use Equation 6.3, the perpetuity model, to calculate the present value of the tax savings from debt:

All we need now is the appropriate discount rate. In this case, it is reasonable to assume that the appropriate discount rate equals the 5 percent cost of debt. This is a reasonable assumption because we know that the discount rate should reflect the risk of the cash flow stream that is being discounted. Since the firm will benefit from the interest tax shield only if it is able to make the required interest payments, the cash savings associated with the tax shield are about as risky as the cash flow stream associated with the interest payments. This implies that the value of the future tax savings is:

If you look closely at this calculation, you will see that $280 is exactly equal to the product of the $1,000 that the firm would borrow and its 28 percent tax rate (D × t). In other words:

(16.4)
This is because kDebt is in both the numerator and the denominator in the formula and cancels out.

You can see in the above example that the value of the interest tax shield increases with the amount of the debt that a firm has outstanding and with the size of the corporate tax rate. More debt or a higher tax rate implies a larger benefit.

It is important to recognize that the income tax benefit we calculated using the perpetuity model is an upper limit for this value. This is true for several reasons. The perpetuity model assumes that (1) the firm will continue to be in business forever, (2) the firm will be able to realize the tax savings in the years in which the interest payments are made (the firm’s EBIT will always be at least as great as the interest expense), and (3) the firm’s tax rate will remain at 28 percent. As we note in Appendix C, which is available in your ebook or Wiley Course Resources, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also limits the deduction of pre-tax interest expense to 30 percent of EBITDA or EBIT. This can result in a further reduction in the value of the income tax benefit of debt for some firms.

In the real world, each of these conditions is likely to be violated. While a corporation has an indefinite life, the fact is that corporations go out of business. Of course, at that point the tax benefit ends. Even firms that do not go out of business are unlikely to realize the full benefit of the tax shield. Firms occasionally have poor operating performance, which can prevent them from realizing the benefit of the interest deduction in the year when the payment is made. In such cases, firms often must carry the tax loss forward and apply it to earnings in a future year. Carrying a tax deduction forward reduces its value by pushing it further into the future. Finally, even if the firm is profitable, the effective tax rate can fall below 28 percent because earnings are lower than expected or the firm has other deductions that reduce the value of the interest tax shield.

You might be asking yourself, too, whether it is reasonable to assume that a firm will borrow money forever. As we discussed in Chapter 13, it is reasonable to assume that the long-term borrowings by firms will be in place as long as the firm is in business. While the specific debt instruments used by firms are not perpetuities, firms do tend to roll over their maturing debt by borrowing new money to make required principal payments. Doing this replaces maturing debt with new debt, thereby leaving the amount of debt for the firm unchanged. As long as a firm does not shrink, prompting it to pay down some of its debt, and as long as the firm does not currently have too much debt, long-term debt can be considered permanent.

The value of the interest tax shield adds to the total value of a firm. In other words, the value of a firm with debt equals the value of that firm without debt plus the present value of the interest tax shield. If only the tax condition, from among the three conditions identified by M&M, is violated, the more debt a firm has, the more it will be worth. This is illustrated in Exhibit 16.6, where we plot the value of a firm with debt, a financially leveraged firm, against the proportion of the firm’s total capital represented by debt.

To illustrate how taxes affect firm value, let’s return to the initial Millennium Motors example. This time, we will assume that the company must pay corporate taxes equal to 28 percent of its taxable income. As before, the firm is financed entirely with common stock, and management is considering changing its capital structure by selling a $200 perpetual bond with an interest rate of 5 percent and paying a one-time special dividend of $200. The firm produces annual cash flows of $100, and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows is 10 percent. What is the value of the firm without any debt, and what will the value be if the restructuring is completed?

We begin by calculating the value of Millennium Motors without any debt. If the entire $100 in pretax cash flows that the firm generates is taxable, Millennium’s after-tax cash flows will equal $72 per year [$100 × (1 − 0.28) = $72]. Using the perpetuity formula, we find that the value of the unleveraged firm is $720 ($72/0.10 = $720) with a 10 percent discount rate.

We next calculate the value of the interest tax shield that would accompany the new debt. This value is $56 (D × t = $200 × 0.28 = $56). The total value of the firm after the restructuring is equal to the value of the unleveraged firm plus the value of the tax shield. In this case, that is $776 ($720 + $56 = $776).

EXHIBIT 16.6 How Firm Value Changes with Leverage When Interest Payments Are Tax Deductible and Dividends Are Not The value of a firm increases with leverage when interest payments are tax deductible and dividend payments are not, and when the second and third M&M conditions apply; there are no information or transaction costs and that the real investment policy of the firm is not affected by its capital structure decisions.


We can also calculate the WACC for Millennium Motors after the financial restructuring using Equation 13.7. To do so, we must first calculate the value of the equity (VEquity). In this case, since we know from Equation 16.1 that VFirm = VEquity + VDebt, we can calculate the value of the equity to be $576 (VEquity = VFirm − VDebt = $776 − $200 = $576). Since we also know that the cash flows available to stockholders after the restructuring will equal $64.80 [($100.00 − $10.00) × (1 − 0.28) = $64.80], we can calculate the required return on equity to be 11.25 percent ($64.80/$576.00 = 0.1125). This is the same number we got when we used Equation 16.3. With these values, we are now ready to calculate the WACC:

As Exhibit 16.4 illustrates, the cost of common stock increases with the amount of debt in the firm’s capital structure. In this example, it goes from 10 percent to 11.25 percent. However, with the interest tax deduction, the WACC actually decreases from 10 percent (recall that the cost of equity equals the WACC for a firm with no debt) to 9.28 percent.

When we perform the same calculations for other potential debt levels at Millennium, we see how the value of the firm increases and the WACC decreases as the amount of debt in the capital structure increases. This is illustrated in Exhibit 16.7 for levels of debt ranging from $0 to $800.

You should note several other points concerning Exhibit 16.7. First, we do not show the calculations for a firm with 100 percent debt because all firms must have some common equity. Second, the payments to investors and the firm value increase as the amount of debt financing increases. This is because the size of the government’s slice of the pie gets smaller. Third, for simplicity, we assume that the cost of debt remains constant. However, even though the cost of equity increases, the WACC decreases. This decrease is entirely due to the interest tax shield. Finally, while the value of the firm under each scenario is calculated as we have illustrated, you can confirm the answer by noting that the firm value for each capital structure equals the payments to investors for the unleveraged firm, $65, divided by the WACC. The payments to investors for the unleveraged firm are used in this calculation, regardless of the firm’s capital structure, because, as was the case for project analysis, the effects of capital structure choices are reflected in the discount rate rather than the cash flows.

EXHIBIT 16.7 The Effect of Taxes on the Firm Value and WACC of Millennium Motors

The value of Millennium Motors increases and its WACC decreases with the amount of debt in the capital structure. The calculations assume that the cost of debt remains constant regardless of the amount of leverage and that the second and third M&M conditions apply.

Learning by Doing Application 16.3 presents another example of how debt affects firm value and WACC.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 16.3
Calculating the Effect of Debt on Firm Value and WACC

Problem

Up to this point, you have financed your pizza chain entirely with equity. You have heard about the tax benefit associated with using debt financing and are considering borrowing $1 million at an interest rate of 6 percent to take advantage of the interest tax shield. You do not need the extra money in the business, so you will distribute it to yourself through a special dividend. You are the only stockholder.

Your pizza business generates taxable (pretax) cash flows of $300,000 each year and pays taxes at a rate of 25 percent; the cost of assets, kAssets (which equals kcs for your unleveraged firm), is 10 percent. What is the value of your firm without debt, and how much would $1 million of debt increase its value if you assume that all cash flows are perpetuities and that the second and third M&M conditions hold (that is, there are no information or transaction costs and the real investment policy of the firm is not affected by its capital structure decisions)? Also, what would the WACC for your business be before and after the proposed financial restructuring?





We can also show that with taxes the cost of equity can be written as:

(16.5)
From Learning by Doing Application 16.3, we calculate the kcs as

which is the same value that we had previously.

Decision Making Example 16.1 shows how a change in the tax rate can affect a firm’s capital structure.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 16.1
Capital Structure and Tax Rates

Situation

You are the chief financial officer at Maricopa Manufacturing Company in Phoenix, Arizona. The company is currently financed with 30 percent debt and 70 percent equity. Maricopa’s chief lobbyist in Washington, D.C., just told you that she expects the federal government will increase the corporate income tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent beginning next year. What action should you take with regard to Maricopa’s capital structure?



Other Benefits

Any firm that must pay taxes can benefit from the interest tax shield. Not surprisingly, most financial managers cite it as a major benefit from using debt in a firm’s capital structure.

Although the tax benefit is important, you should be aware of other benefits. For example, it is less expensive to issue debt than to issue stock. Underwriting spreads and out-of-pocket costs are more than three times as large for stock sales as they are for bond sales. Recall from Chapter 15 (in Exhibit 15.6) that a firm raising between $25.0 million and $49.9 million will typically pay 7.09 percent of the amount raised to sell stock, but only 1.63 percent of the amount raised to sell bonds—a substantial difference. This benefit is related to the second of the three conditions identified by M&M. Issuance costs are a form of transaction costs. If there were no transaction costs, then debt issues would not have this cost advantage.

Another benefit associated with using debt financing is that debt provides managers with incentives to focus on maximizing the firm’s cash flows. Unlike dividends, which are discretionary, interest and principal payments must be made when they are due. Because managers must make these payments or face the prospect of bankruptcy, the use of debt puts pressure on managers to focus on the efficiency of the business. Because a bankruptcy filing can destroy a manager’s career, managers will work very hard to avoid letting this happen. Providing managers with these incentives can increase the overall value of the firm.

Finally, debt can be used to limit the ability of bad managers to waste the stockholders’ money on things such as private corporate jets, plush offices, and other negative NPV projects that benefit the managers personally. It does this by forcing managers to distribute excess cash to the investors.

The benefits arising from providing managers with incentives to focus on the cash flows generated by their firms and limiting their ability to make poor investments are related to the second and third conditions identified by M&M. These benefits are related to information and transaction costs because if investors had enough information to know whether managers were doing the right thing, or if it were reasonably inexpensive to provide the managers with pay packages that gave them incentives to do the right thing on their own, there would be no such benefits from debt. The benefits also relate directly to the M&M condition that capital structure decisions do not affect the real investment policies of the firm. The whole point of using debt to limit the investments managers can make is to change firms’ real investment policies so that managers focus on investing in only positive NPV projects.

The Costs of Debt
We have discussed several benefits associated with using debt. If this were the whole story, choosing the optimal capital structure would be straightforward. More debt would imply a higher firm value, and financial managers would use as much debt as possible. In other words, a plot of a firm’s value against the proportion of debt in its capital structure would look like the upward-sloping line in Exhibit 16.6. Managers would try to move their firms’ capital structures as far to the right as possible, and we would expect to see firms using as close to 100 percent debt financing as possible.

Recall, however, that the debt of the average public firm represents only about 20 percent of the value of the firm. The fact that this number is so much lower than 100 percent raises a question: Is it just that financial managers do not understand the benefits of debt, or is something else going on? As you might suspect, the answer to this question is that financial managers are pretty smart and are limiting the amount of debt in their firms’ capital structures for some very good reasons. Offsetting the benefits of debt are costs, and these costs can be quite substantial at high levels of debt.

Exhibit 16.8 illustrates how the costs of using debt combine with the benefits to result in an optimal capital structure that includes less than 100 percent debt. At low levels of debt, the benefits are greater than the costs, and adding more debt increases the overall value of the firm. However, at some point the costs begin to exceed the benefits, and adding more debt financing destroys firm value. Financial managers want to add debt just to the point at which the value of the firm is maximized.

The costs of using debt fall into two general categories: bankruptcy costs and agency costs.

Bankruptcy Costs

Bankruptcy costs, also referred to as costs of financial distress, are costs associated with financial difficulties that a firm might get into because it uses debt financing. The term bankruptcy costs is used rather loosely in capital structure discussions to refer to costs incurred when a firm gets into financial distress. Financial distress occurs when a firm is not able to make all of the interest and principal payments that it owes its lenders. A financially distressed firm might subsequently enter into a formal legal bankruptcy process, such as those under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, but not all financially distressed firms will do this. Consequently, as you will see shortly, firms can incur the bankruptcy costs discussed in this section even if they never actually file for bankruptcy.

bankruptcy costs, or costs of financial distress costs associated with financial difficulties a firm might experience because it uses debt financing

EXHIBIT 16.8 Trade-Off Theory of Capital Structure The benefits and costs of debt combine to affect firm value. For low levels of debt, adding more debt to a firm’s capital structure increases firm value because the additional (marginal) benefits are greater than the additional (marginal) costs. However, at some point, which is the point at which the value of the firm is maximized, the costs of adding more debt begin to outweigh the benefits, and the value of the firm decreases as more debt is added. The difference between the upward-sloping line and the curved line reflects the costs associated with debt.


Direct Bankruptcy Costs
Direct bankruptcy costs are out-of-pocket costs that a firm incurs as a result of financial distress. These costs include fees paid to lawyers, accountants, and consultants. One of the first actions a firm’s management takes when the firm gets into financial distress is to initiate negotiations with its lenders to defer its interest and principal payments. This deferment can give management more time to correct whatever went wrong with the firm’s operations that made it difficult to make interest and principal payments in the first place. Lawyers are experienced in assisting in these negotiations and in writing the necessary legal documents. Additional accounting support often becomes necessary to satisfy demands for information from lenders and to help management figure out what went wrong. Consultants might be hired to help identify and implement changes to improve the firm’s performance. In some cases, the bankruptcy process can take over a year. The costs of hiring all of these people are included in direct bankruptcy costs. For example, accountants, lawyers, and other professionals providing services in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy were reportedly paid more than $2.2 billion in fees, while for the General Motors bankruptcy it was $110 million (which one expert suggested was astonishingly low given the size of the company!). Since the probability of financial distress increases with the amount of debt that a firm uses, the expected size of these costs increases with leverage, driving up the interest rate that investors charge the firm for its debt. Investors charge a higher interest rate when the expected value of direct bankruptcy costs increases because the payment of these costs is likely to come out of the cash flows that they would otherwise receive.

direct bankruptcy costs out-of-pocket costs that a firm incurs when it gets into financial distress

You might be asking yourself why the lenders to a firm would defer interest and principal payments. After all, pushing these payments further into the future reduces the present value of the payments that the lenders are promised. The reason is simple: it can cost lenders even more if they refuse to work with management and the firm is forced to file for bankruptcy. Once a firm files for bankruptcy, legal fees increase because the firm must hire attorneys to help with the bankruptcy process, and accounting fees increase because the bankruptcy process will require the firm to generate even more information. In addition, the firm must reimburse the court for the costs that it incurs. By negotiating with management up front, the lenders might be able to help the firm avoid incurring the costs associated with the formal bankruptcy process. This leaves more value in the firm, which can be used to satisfy the lenders’ claims.

Direct bankruptcy costs are a form of transaction costs that must be incurred to facilitate negotiations with lenders and to navigate the bankruptcy process. The second condition identified by M&M—that there are no transaction and information costs—assumes that these transaction costs do not exist. Because the costs do exist, they tend to offset, at least to some extent, the benefits associated with debt. In fact, researchers have estimated that direct bankruptcty costs can amount to as much as 3 to 5 percent of firm value. Although these costs are substantial, they are not large enough on their own to cause the firm value curve to turn downward in the manner illustrated in Exhibit 16.8.

Indirect Bankruptcy Costs
Indirect bankruptcy costs are costs associated with changes in the behavior of people who deal with a firm when it becomes financially distressed. The interests of many people who deal with a firm are normally similar to those of the stockholders—they all want to maximize the firm’s value. However, when a firm gets into financial distress, the interests of these people begin to differ, and the actions they take to protect their interests often reduce firm value.

indirect bankruptcy costs costs associated with changes in the behavior of people who deal with a firm when the firm gets into financial distress

For example, suppose a firm’s products come with warranties or require after-sales service or parts (automobiles, for example) and it becomes known that the firm is having financial difficulties. Some of this firm’s potential customers will decide to purchase a competitor’s products because of concerns that the firm will not be able to honor its warranties or that parts or service will not be available in the future. Other customers will demand a lower price to compensate them for these risks. In either case, the firm’s revenues will decline below what they would otherwise have been. Indeed, when automaker SAAB was about to file for bankruptcy, new SAAB vehicles were being offered at record-low prices as dealers struggled to sell their inventory.

When suppliers learn that a firm is in financial distress, they worry about not being paid. They can do little about goods they have already shipped, but to protect against losses for future shipments, they often begin to require cash on delivery. In other words, they will deliver supplies only if the firm pays cash for them. This requirement can be devastating for a financially distressed firm because such a firm typically does not have much cash. For example, if a retailer, like a department store, cannot pay cash for its merchandise, the amount of merchandise on the shelves in its stores will decline over time. Customers will not be able to find what they want, and they will respond by shopping at competitors’ stores. This will cause revenues to decline even faster than they might otherwise have. In the worst case, suppliers’ demands for cash payments can force a firm to stop operating altogether.

Employees at a distressed firm worry that their jobs or benefits are in danger, and some start looking for new jobs. The loss of highly skilled employees can reduce the value of the firm, especially if they take jobs with direct competitors. Even when employees do not leave, their productivity will often decline because the firm’s problems lead to lower morale and distractions.

Like direct bankruptcy costs, indirect bankruptcy costs are transaction costs that would not exist under the second condition identified by M&M. They are transaction costs because they represent costs incurred in the course of contracting with the people who deal with the firm.

If the firm enters into the formal bankruptcy process, it incurs another indirect bankruptcy cost. This cost stems from the fact that the bankruptcy judge must approve all of the firm’s major investments. Bankruptcy judges are responsible for representing the interests of the creditors and tend to be more conservative than the stockholders would like. This results in a change in the firm’s real investment policy and a violation of the third M&M condition.

Building Intuition
People Behave Differently toward a Firm in Financial Distress, and This Increases Bankruptcy Costs

When a firm gets into financial distress, the people who deal with the company take actions to protect their interests. These actions often contribute to the firm’s problems because when the firm is financially distressed, the interests of customers, suppliers, and employees, among others, differ from those of stockholders.

The nature of indirect bankruptcy costs differs from company to company. For example, loss of skilled workers is more damaging to a technology firm than to a retailer. Potential customers of an auto manufacturer worry a lot more about the implications of financial distress than potential customers of a company that makes T-shirts, whereas suppliers are concerned in both of these cases. In spite of these differences, indirect bankruptcy costs are often very substantial and are reflected in the interest rates that firms must pay. Researchers have estimated that indirect bankruptcy costs range from 10 to 23 percent of firm value, suggesting that they can be large enough to offset the interest tax shield benefit of debt.

It is worth stressing that indirect bankruptcy costs occur at absolutely the worst time for a firm. The point at which a firm gets into financial distress is the point at which it can benefit most from the support of people who deal with it. However, this is exactly when it is often in the best interests of those people to provide less support and, in many cases, abandon the firm. The associated changes in behavior can accelerate the firm’s deterioration and push it into formal bankruptcy.

Agency Costs

The managers and stockholders of a firm also often behave in ways that reduce a firm’s value when the firm becomes financially distressed. The resulting costs are a type of agency cost. You may recall from Chapter 1 that agency costs result from conflicts of interest between principals and agents. In agency relationships, one party, known as the principal, delegates decision-making authority to another party, known as the agent. The agent is expected to act in the interest of the principal. However, agents’ interests sometimes conflict with those of the principal.

To better understand agency costs, consider the following example. Suppose you own a start-up that delivers food from local restaurants to area businesses during lunch hours. You want to go on vacation for a week, so you offer a friend $500 to make the scheduled deliveries for your business while you are gone. If your friend accepts the arrangement, you have entered into a principal–agent relationship. You advise your friend before you leave town that it is essential that the deliveries be made on time to ensure the quality of the food. Unfortunately, this is final exam week for your friend, and she is over an hour late in delivering several of the orders scheduled during the week of your vacation. Because of the late service, two of the restaurants that have been regular customers have informed you that they will no longer be using you for their deliveries, costing you a lot of future income. These losses are an example of agency costs, as they arose because you delegated decision-making authority to your friend, and she acted in her best interest rather than yours.

Stockholder–Manager Agency Costs
Stockholders hire managers to manage the firm on their behalf. In this relationship, managers receive considerable decision-making authority. While the board of directors approves major decisions and monitors the performance of the managers on behalf of the stockholders, managers still make many decisions that the board never observes. To the extent that the managers’ incentives are not perfectly identical to those of the stockholders, managers will make some decisions that benefit themselves at the expense of the stockholders.

As we saw in our discussion of the benefits of debt, a firm’s use of debt financing can help align the interests of managers with those of stockholders. Using debt financing provides managers with incentives to focus on maximizing the firm’s cash flows and limits the ability of bad managers to waste the stockholders’ money on negative NPV projects. These benefits amount to reductions in the agency costs associated with the principal–agent relationship between stockholders and managers.

Although the use of debt financing can reduce agency costs, it can also increase these costs by altering the behavior of managers. Managers often have a high proportion of their wealth riding on the success of the firm, through their stockholdings, future income, and reputations. Consequently, they tend to prefer less risk than stockholders who hold more diversified portfolios. As you know, the use of debt increases the volatility of a firm’s earnings and the probability that the firm will get into financial difficulty. This increased risk causes managers to make more conservative decisions. For example, managers of firms with more financial leverage will have greater incentives to turn down positive NPV projects with high risk than otherwise similar managers at firms with less leverage. Similarly, managers at highly financially leveraged firms will prefer to distribute fewer profits to stockholders because earnings retained as cash provide a buffer against possible bankruptcy. These types of actions reduce the overall value of the firm for stockholders and are examples of agency costs associated with the use of debt financing.

Recall that the third M&M condition is that the use of debt financing does not affect the firm’s real investment policy. To the extent that using debt financing causes managers to turn down high-risk positive NPV projects and distribute fewer earnings, however, financing decisions do affect real investment policies. Leverage provides managers with incentives to invest in lower-risk positive NPV projects rather than in all positive NPV projects. It also provides them with incentives to retain excess earnings. They might even have incentives to invest some of the excess retained earnings in low-risk negative NPV projects. The fact that managers may act in this way is another reason that debt financing affects the value of the firm.

Stockholder–Lender Agency Costs
A principal–agent relationship also exists between lenders and stockholders. When investors lend money to a firm, they delegate authority to the stockholders to decide how that money will be used. The lenders expect that the stockholders, through the managers they appoint, will invest the money in a way that enables the firm to make all of the interest and principal payments that have been promised. However, stockholders may have incentives to use the money in ways that are not in the best interests of the lenders.

For example, stockholders might decide that instead of investing the money to grow the firm, they will distribute it to themselves as a dividend. In the U.S. corporate system, the liability of stockholders is limited to the amount of money they have invested in the firm. Since loans that are made to a corporation are contracts between the lenders and the corporation, not the stockholders, paying such a dividend reduces the resources in the firm that are available to repay the lenders and therefore the value of the lenders’ claims. Unless the dividend violates the loan agreement or otherwise violates the law, the lenders have no way to get that money back. This is an example of what we call a wealth transfer from the lenders to the stockholders. Wealth has been transferred because the stockholders have made themselves better off at the expense of the lenders.

Lenders know that stockholders have incentives to distribute some or all of the funds that they borrow as dividends. To protect themselves against this sort of behavior, lenders often include provisions in loan agreements that limit the ability of stockholders to pay dividends. However, these provisions are not entirely foolproof. Stockholders can be very innovative in transferring wealth from lenders to themselves.

For example, in October 1992 Marriott Corporation had a substantial amount of debt that had been borrowed to build new hotels. The economy was in a recession, and there was growing concern about the ability of Marriott to make all of its promised interest and principal payments. If the company defaulted, the stockholders stood to lose a good deal of the value of their stock.

In response to this situation, Marriott management announced a spin-off in which the company would be split into two separate companies. After the spin-off, stockholders would own one share of stock in each of the two new companies for every share that they had owned in the original company. While spin-offs are quite common, this one was unique in that the company was spinning off its most profitable businesses into one company and leaving much of its debt, some real estate, and a small operating business in the other. The spin-off effectively reduced the value of the assets that the lenders would have to rely on to receive their interest and principal payments while reducing the assets that the stockholders could lose if there was a default. When the spin-off was announced, the market value of Marriott’s public bonds decreased 16.51 percent, or $333.3 million, while the market value of Marriott’s outstanding stock increased by $236.3 million.11 The increase in the value of the stock represented a wealth transfer from the lenders to the stockholders. In addition, the fact that the value of the debt went down more than the value of the equity increased suggests that the capital markets did not like this transaction: the total value of the firm (debt plus equity) went down.

Notice that when we talk about stockholder–lender agency costs, we assume that managers do exactly what the stockholders would like them to do. However, in the discussion of stockholder–manager agency costs, we saw that managers are not always so cooperative. This results in some conflicting possibilities with respect to how financial leverage affects managers’ decisions. For example, in a firm that uses debt financing, managers prefer to invest in low-risk projects, whereas diversified stockholders prefer high-risk projects. Stockholders will pressure managers to invest in riskier projects, but whether stockholders get what they want will depend on how strong the corporate governance system is in the firm.

To better understand the nature of the conflict between stockholders and lenders, consider the following example. Suppose a firm has $50 million invested in 10 percent risk-free bonds that will pay $55 million in one year. The firm also has one-year debt on which $50 million of interest and principal will be due when it matures in a year. In other words, this firm is solvent and will be able to repay its debt, but the equity will be worth only $5 million at the end of the year, since this is all that will be left over after the lenders are paid.

Now suppose that the stockholders decide to sell the risk-free bonds and invest in a project that has a 50 percent chance of returning $95 million in one year and a 50 percent chance of returning only $15 million. Instead of receiving $50 million with no risk, the lenders now face a 50 percent chance of receiving the $50 million they are owed, and a 50 percent chance of receiving only $15 million. The value that the lenders expect to receive is $32.5 million:

This amount is $17.5 million less than the $50 million that the lenders expected to receive when the firm held the risk-free bonds. The value that the stockholders expect to receive, on the other hand, has increased by $17.5 million, from $5 million to $22.5 million:

The change to riskier assets has resulted in a $17.5 million wealth transfer. This is known as the asset substitution problem. Once a loan has been made to a firm, the stockholders have an incentive to substitute more risky assets for less risky assets.

asset substitution problem the incentive that stockholders in a financially leveraged firm have to substitute more risky assets for less risky assets

Under certain circumstances, stockholders will actually have incentives to invest in risky negative NPV projects. To see how this can happen, assume that the stockholders in our example sell the $50 million of risk-free bonds and invest the proceeds in a project that has a 50 percent chance of returning $70 million and a 50 percent chance of returning $10 million. The expected return on the $50 million investment is $40 million [(0.50 × $70) + (0.50 × $10) = $40 million]. This is a negative NPV project. However, the value that the stockholders can expect to receive is $10 million—twice as much as the $5 million they could expect to receive when the firm owned the risk-free bonds:

The lenders bear the $15 million loss in firm value ($55 million − $40 million = $15 million), and they pay for the $5 million gain to the stockholders. The lenders now expect to receive $20 million less than the $50 million they would have received if the risk-free bonds had not been sold:

A situation similar to that just described confronted stockholders of firms in the U.S. savings and loan industry in the mid-1980s. Many small savings and loan firms had a very high ratio of debt to equity and faced the possibility that they would have to file for bankruptcy. With little to lose, managers at savings and loan firms, who were often also large stockholders, started making very risky real estate loans with high rates of interest. They knew that if the loans were repaid, their firms would avoid bankruptcy and the stockholders would realize much of the benefit. If the loans were not repaid, the government, which insured all of the deposits used to finance the loans, would have to bear the loss. Ultimately, these sorts of investments led to what became known as the savings and loan crisis.

Stockholders of financially distressed firms can also have incentives to turn down positive NPV projects. This situation is known as the underinvestment problem. It occurs in a financially distressed firm when the value that is created by investing in a positive NPV project is likely to go to the lenders instead of the stockholders. For example, as of 2018 some companies in the oil industry with very high debt levels needed more cash to explore for, and extract from, potentially profitable oil and gas reserves. Given their poor financial condition, they could not raise more debt, and stockholders would not provide more equity to fund these investments, as any profits would go to paying the debt holders.

underinvestment problem the incentive that stockholders in a financially leveraged firm have to turn down positive NPV projects when the firm is in financial distress

To see how this can happen, suppose that a company has debt with a face value of $50 million outstanding and that the value of the company’s assets is $32.5 million. If the assets of this financially distressed firm were sold today, the lenders would receive $32.5 million, and the stockholders would receive nothing. Now suppose that the managers of the firm identify a project that requires a $5 million investment and will return $17.5 million tomorrow with no risk. Since the firm is distressed, management will have to sell stock to raise the $5 million required for this investment. Does it make sense for the stockholders to make the investment?

The answer is no, because if the stockholders invest the $5 million, they can expect to get nothing back if the firm is subsequently sold. Both the $5 million that the stockholders invest and the $12.5 million NPV ($17.5 million − $5 million = $12.5 million) from the project will go to the lenders. Instead of receiving $32.5 million, the lenders will receive $50 million, and the stockholders will be out $5 million. This example illustrates why, in the real world, financially distressed businesses have a very difficult time raising equity capital.

It is important to note that without financial leverage, there would be no asset substitution or underinvestment problems. Stockholders would always want to invest in positive NPV projects and reject negative NPV projects regardless of their risk.

Lenders know that debt provides stockholders with incentives to alter their firms’ investment policies to engage in asset substitution and to turn down positive NPV projects. However, it is difficult to write contracts that protect lenders against this sort of behavior. Therefore, as with any other risk that they cannot eliminate, lenders compensate by increasing the interest rate that they charge. This increases the cost of adding more debt to a firm’s capital structure.

The fact that there are a number of different benefits and costs associated with the use of debt financing suggests that managers will balance, or trade off, the benefits against the costs when they choose a firm’s capital structure. We discuss this idea along with an alternative theory for how managers choose their firms’ capital structures in the next section.

16.3 Two Theories of Capital Structure
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the trade-off and pecking order theories of capital structure choice and explain what the empirical evidence tells us about these theories.
How do managers choose the capital structures for their firms? Next, we consider two theories that attempt to explain how this choice is made: the trade-off theory and the pecking order theory.

The Trade-Off Theory
The trade-off theory of capital structure states that managers choose a specific target capital structure based on the trade-offs between the benefits and the costs of debt. This target capital structure is the capital structure that maximizes the value of the firm, as illustrated in Exhibit 16.8.

trade-off theory the theory that managers trade off the benefits against the costs of using debt to identify the optimal capital structure for a firm

Underlying the trade-off theory is the idea that when a firm uses a small amount of debt financing, it receives the interest tax shield and possibly some of the other benefits we discussed. Since leverage is low and the chances that the firm will get into financial difficulties are also low, the costs of debt are small relative to the benefits, and firm value increases. However, as more and more debt is added to the firm’s capital structure, the marginal costs of debt increase and eventually reach the point where the cost associated with the next dollar that is borrowed equals the benefit. Beyond this point, the costs of adding additional debt exceed the benefits, and any additional debt reduces firm value. The trade-off theory of capital structure says that managers will increase debt to the point at which the costs and benefits of adding another dollar of debt are exactly equal because this is the capital structure that maximizes firm value.

The Pecking Order Theory
The trade-off theory makes intuitive sense, but there is another popular theory of how the capital structures of firms are determined. This is known as the pecking order theory. The pecking order theory recognizes that different types of capital have different costs and that this leads to a pecking order in the financing choices that managers make. Managers choose the least expensive capital first then move to increasingly costly capital when the lower-cost sources of capital are no longer available.

pecking order theory the theory that when financing projects, managers first use retained earnings, which they view as the least expensive form of capital, then debt, and finally externally raised equity, which they view as the most expensive

Under the pecking order theory, managers view internally generated funds, or cash on hand, as the cheapest source of capital.12 Debt is more costly to obtain than internally generated funds but is still relatively inexpensive. In contrast, raising money by selling stock can be very expensive. As we saw in Exhibit 15.6, the out-of-pocket costs of selling equity are much higher than the comparable costs for bonds. In addition, the filings required by government agencies, such as the SEC, are greater, and the stock market tends to react negatively to announcements that firms are selling stock. When firms announce that they will sell stock, their stock prices often decline because such sales can be interpreted as evidence that the firms are not profitable enough to fund their investments internally. Of course, a lower stock price reduces the value of everyone’s shares and makes future stock issues even more costly, since more shares will have to be sold to raise the same dollar amount.

The pecking order theory says that firms use internally generated funds as long as they are available. Following that, they tend to borrow money to finance additional projects until they are no longer able to do so because of restrictions in loan agreements or until high interest rates make debt unattractive. Only then will managers choose to sell equity. Notice that the pecking order theory does not assume that managers have a target capital structure. Rather, it implies that the capital structure of a firm is, in some sense, a by-product of the firm’s financing history.

The Empirical Evidence
At this point, you might be asking yourself what we know about how capital structures are determined in the real world. A great deal of research has been done in this area, and the evidence supports both of the theories we have just described. When researchers compare the capital structures in different industries, they find evidence that supports the trade-off theory. Industries with a great many tangible assets, such as the air transportation and printing, publishing, and related industries, typically use relatively large amounts of debt. In contrast, industries with more intangible assets and numerous growth opportunities, such as the computer and drug industries, use relatively little debt. What accounts for this difference? In part, the difference exists because indirect bankruptcy costs and stockholder–lender agency costs tend to be lower in industries with more tangible assets. The assets in these industries have higher liquidation values, and it is more difficult for stockholders to engage in asset substitution. Exhibit 16.9 shows the variation in capital structures across a sample of industries.

EXHIBIT 16.9 Average Capital Structures for Selected Industries in 2019

This table shows average capital structures for different U.S. industries in 2019. The industries are arranged in order of declining debt-to-firm value ratios, where firm value is estimated as the market value of equity plus the book value of debt. Industries with a great many tangible assets, such as the air transportation and printing, publishing, and related industries, tend to have larger debt-to-firm value ratios.

Air transportation	  40	0.45
Printing, publishing, and related industries	  34	0.39
Communications (including telephone companies)	149	0.39

Some researchers argue that, on average, debt levels appear to be lower than the trade-off theory suggests they should be. Firms pay large amounts of taxes that could be reduced through the use of more debt financing, even though their current capital structures are such that they face little possibility of financial distress. For example, in 2019 the technology firms listed in the opener to this chapter each held cash and short-term securities that exceeded the face value of all of their interest-bearing debt. These firms pay out a great deal of money each year in taxes and yet do not use long-term debt to reduce their tax liability.

More general evidence also indicates that the more profitable a firm is, the less debt it tends to have. This is exactly opposite what the trade-off theory suggests we should see. Under the trade-off theory, more profitable firms pay more taxes, so they should use more debt to take advantage of the interest tax shield. Instead, this evidence is consistent with the pecking order theory. Highly profitable firms have plenty of cash on hand that can be used to finance their projects, and this reduces their need for debt financing.

The pecking order theory is also supported by the fact that, in an average year, public firms actually repurchase more shares than they sell. Moreover, in the United States, internally generated funds represent the largest source of financing for new investments, and debt represents the largest source of external financing.

Both the trade-off theory and the pecking order theory offer some insights into how managers choose the capital structures for their firms. However, neither of them is able to explain all of the capital structure choices that we observe. The truth is that capital structure decisions are very complex, and it is difficult to characterize them with a single general theory. In the next section, we briefly discuss some of the practical issues that managers say they consider when they make capital structure decisions.

16.4 Practical Considerations in Choosing a Capital Structure
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss some of the practical considerations that managers are concerned with when they choose a firm’s capital structure.
When managers talk about capital structure choices, their comments are sprinkled with terms such as financial flexibility, risk, and earnings impact. Managers don’t think only in terms of a trade-off or a pecking order. Rather, they are concerned with how their financing decisions will influence the practical issues that they must deal with when managing a business.

For example, financial flexibility is an important consideration in many capital structure decisions. Managers must ensure that they retain sufficient financial resources in the firm to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and to overcome unforeseen problems. In theory, if a positive NPV investment becomes available, managers should be able to obtain financing for it. Unfortunately, financing might not be available at a reasonable price for all positive NPV projects at all times. For example, it might be difficult to convince investors that a project is as good as management thinks it is. As a result, investors may require too high a return, making the project’s NPV negative and causing the firm to pass up a good opportunity. Similarly, if the firm does not have enough financial flexibility, an unforeseen problem might end up being more costly than it should be. To see how this might happen, suppose that a firm’s major manufacturing facility is destroyed by a hurricane. Insurance would eventually cover much of the loss, but by the time the insurance settlement is received, the company might be out of business. In such a case, cash is needed immediately to help employees so that key skills are not lost and to relocate or start rebuilding as quickly as possible.

Managers are also concerned about the impact of financial leverage on the volatility of the firm’s net income. Most businesses experience fluctuations in their operating profits over time, and we know that fixed interest payments magnify fluctuations in operating profits, thereby causing even greater variation in net income. Managers do not like volatility in reported net income because it causes problems in their relationships with outside investors, who do not like unpredictable earnings. Furthermore, as we have seen, if a firm is too highly leveraged, it runs a greater risk of defaulting on its debt, which can lead to all sorts of bankruptcy and agency costs. Managers use the term risk to describe the possibility that normal fluctuations in operating profits will lead to financial distress. They try to manage their firms’ capital structures in a way that limits the risk to a reasonable level—one that allows them to sleep at night.

A third factor that managers think about when they choose a capital structure is the impact of financial leverage on the size of the firm’s earnings per share. The interest expense associated with debt financing reduces the reported dollar value of net income. However, depending on the market value of the firm’s stock, using debt instead of equity to finance a project can increase the reported dollar value of earnings per share. Many managers are very concerned about the earnings per share that their firms report because they believe that it affects the stock price. Financial theory states that managers should not be so concerned about accounting earnings because cash flows are what really matter. Whether they are right or wrong, if managers believe that accounting earnings matter to investors, their capital structure decisions will reflect this belief.

Another factor that managers consider when making capital structure decisions is the control implications of their decisions. The choice between equity and debt financing affects the control of the firm. For example, suppose that a firm is controlled by the founding family, which owns 55 percent of the common stock, and that the firm must raise capital to fund a large project. The project has a zero NPV, and the capital raised to finance it will result in a 20 percent increase in the value of the firm. On the one hand, using equity financing will drop the founding family’s ownership (voting rights) below 50 percent if the family does not buy some of the new shares. In fact, they will end up with 45.8 percent of the stock [55/(100 + 20) = 0.458, or 45.8 percent]. On the other hand, their ownership will remain at 55 percent, and they will retain absolute control of the firm if the project is financed entirely with debt. In such a situation, the founding family is likely to prefer debt financing. Of course, although debt can help a controlling stockholder retain control of a firm, too much debt can cause that stockholder to lose control. This can happen if the firm uses so much debt that fluctuations in business conditions put the firm in financial distress. When this happens, the ability of the creditors to control what happens to the firm can overwhelm the ability of the controlling stockholder to do so.

These are just some examples of practical considerations that managers must deal with when choosing the appropriate capital structure for a firm. There is no set formula that they can follow in making financing decisions, because many of these considerations are difficult to quantify and their relative importance is unique to each firm. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that the ultimate objective of a firm’s stockholders—and of managers who have the stockholders’ interests in mind—is to choose the capital structure that maximizes the value of the firm.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Describe the two Modigliani and Miller propositions, the key assumptions underlying them, and their relevance to capital structure decisions. Use Proposition 2 to calculate the return on equity.

M&M Proposition 1 states that the value of a firm is unaffected by its capital structure if the following three conditions hold: (1) there are no taxes, (2) there are no information or transaction costs, and (3) capital structure decisions do not affect the real investment policies of the firm. This proposition tells us the three reasons that capital structure choices affect firm value.

M&M Proposition 2 states that the expected return on a firm’s equity increases with the amount of debt in its capital structure. This proposition also shows that the expected return on equity can be separated into two parts—a part that reflects the risk of the underlying assets of the firm and a part that reflects the risk associated with the financial leverage used by the firm. This proposition helps managers understand the implications of financial leverage for the cost of the equity used to finance the firm’s investments. Equation 16.3 can be used to calculate the cost of equity for common stock.

2 Discuss the benefits and costs of using debt financing and calculate the value of the income tax benefit associated with debt.

Using debt financing provides several benefits. A major benefit arises from the deductibility of interest payments. Since interest payments are tax deductible and dividend payments are not, distributing cash to investors through interest payments can increase the value of a firm. Debt is also less expensive to issue than equity. Finally, debt can benefit stockholders in certain situations by providing managers with incentives to maximize the cash flows produced by the firm and by reducing their ability to invest in negative NPV projects.

The costs of debt include bankruptcy and agency costs. Bankruptcy costs arise because financial leverage increases the probability that a firm will get into financial distress. Direct bankruptcy costs are the out-of-pocket costs that a firm incurs when it gets into financial distress, while indirect bankruptcy costs are associated with actions the people who deal with the firm take to protect their own interests when the firm is in financial distress. Agency costs are costs associated with actions taken by managers and stockholders who are acting in their own interests rather than in the best interests of the firm. When a firm uses financial leverage, managers have incentives to take actions that benefit themselves at the expense of stockholders, and stockholders have incentives to take actions that benefit themselves at the expense of lenders. To the extent that these actions reduce the value of lenders’ claims, the expected losses will be reflected in the interest rates that lenders require.

Equation 16.4 can be used to calculate the value of the income tax benefit associated with debt.

3 Describe the trade-off and pecking order theories of capital structure choice and explain what the empirical evidence tells us about these theories.

The trade-off theory says that managers balance, or trade off, the benefits of debt against the costs of debt when choosing a firm’s capital structure in an effort to maximize the value of the firm. The pecking order theory says that managers raise capital as they need it in the least expensive way available, starting with internally generated funds, then moving to debt, then to the sale of equity. In contrast to the trade-off theory, the pecking order theory does not imply that managers have a particular target capital structure. There is empirical evidence that supports both theories, suggesting that each helps explain the capital structure choices made by managers.

4 Discuss some of the practical considerations that managers are concerned with when they choose a firm’s capital structure.

Practical considerations that concern managers when they choose a firm’s capital structure include the impact of the capital structure on financial flexibility, risk, net income, and the control of the firm. Financial flexibility involves having the necessary financial resources to take advantage of unforeseen opportunities and to overcome unforeseen problems. Risk refers to the possibility that normal fluctuations in operating profits will lead to financial distress. Managers are also concerned with the impact of financial leverage on their reported net income, especially on a per-share basis. Finally, the impact of capital structure decisions on who controls the firm is also a concern.

Discussion Questions
16.1 List and briefly describe the three key assumptions in Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition 1 that are required for total firm value to be independent of capital structure.

16.2 Evaluate the statement that the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a firm (assuming that all three assumptions of Modigliani and Miller’s propositions hold) is always less than or equal to the cost of equity for the firm.

16.3 If the value of the firm remains constant as a function of its capital structure and the three Modigliani and Miller assumptions apply, why might the overall cost of capital change or not change as capital structure changes?

16.4 Consider the WACC for a firm that pays taxes. Explain what the best course of action would be to minimize the firm’s WACC and thereby maximize its value. Use the WACC formula for your explanation.

16.5 The Modigliani and Miller propositions, when the no-tax assumption is relaxed, suggest that the firm should finance itself with as much debt as possible. Taking this suggestion to the extreme, is it even possible to finance a firm with 100 percent debt and no equity? Why or why not?

16.6 Crossler Automobiles sells autos in a market where the standard auto comes with a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty on all parts and labor. Describe how an increased probability of bankruptcy could affect sales of autos by Crossler.

16.7 Agency problems occur because the nonowner managers and stockholders of a firm have different interests. Propose a capital structure change that might help better align these different interests.

16.8 If a firm increases its debt to a very high level, then the positive effect of debt in aligning the interests of management with those of stockholders tends to become negative. Explain why this occurs.

16.9 Using the Modigliani and Miller framework, but excluding the assumptions that there are no taxes and no information or transaction costs, describe the value of the firm as a function of the proportion of debt in its capital structure.

16.10 When we observe the capital structure of many firms, we find that they tend to utilize lower levels of debt than that predicted by the trade-off theory. Offer an explanation for this.

Questions and Problems
 Excel templates and resources available in Wiley Course Resources.

Basic
16.1 M&M Proposition 1: The Modigliani and Miller theory suggests that the value of the firm’s assets is equal to the value of the claims on those assets and is not dependent on how the asset claims are divided. The common analogy to the theorem is that the total amount of pie available to be eaten (the firm) does not depend on the size of each slice of pie. If we continue with that analogy, then what if we cut up the pie with a very dull knife such that the total amount of pie available to be eaten is less after it is cut than before it was cut. Which of the three Modigliani and Miller assumptions, if relaxed, is analogous to the dull knife? Hint: Think about the process by which investors could undo the effects of a firm’s capital structure decisions.

16.2 M&M Proposition 1: Describe what exactly is meant when someone is distinguishing between the value of the firm and the value of the equity of the firm.

16.3 M&M Proposition 1: Under Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition 1, when all three of the assumptions remain in effect, explain how the value of the firm changes due to changes in the proportion of debt and equity utilized by the firm.

16.4 M&M Proposition 1: Cerberus Security Company produces a cash flow of $200 per year and is expected to continue doing so in the infinite future. The cost of equity capital for Cerberus is 20 percent, and the firm is financed entirely with equity. Management would like to repurchase $100 in shares by borrowing $100 at a 10 percent annual rate (assume that the debt will also be outstanding into the infinite future). Using Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition 1, what is the value of the firm today, and what will be the value of the claims on the firm’s assets after the stock repurchase? What will be the rate of return on common stock required by investors after the stock repurchase?

16.5 M&M Proposition 1: A firm that is financed completely with equity currently has a cost of capital equal to 15 percent. Assume that the assumptions in Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition 1 hold and that the firm’s management plans to change its capital structure to 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity. What will be the cost of equity after the change if the cost of debt is 10 percent?

16.6 M&M Proposition 1: Swan Specialty Cycles is currently financed with 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity. The firm pays $125 each year to its debt investors (at a 10 percent cost of debt), and the debt has no maturity date. What will be the value of the equity if the firm repurchases all of its debt and raises the funds to do this by issuing equity? Assume that all of the assumptions in Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition 1 hold.

16.7 M&M Proposition 1: The weighted average cost of capital for a firm, assuming all three Modigliani and Miller assumptions hold, is 10 percent. What is the current cost of equity capital for the firm if the cost of debt for the firm is 8 percent and the firm is 80 percent financed with debt?

16.8 Interest tax shield benefit: Legitron Corporation has $350 million of debt outstanding at an interest rate of 9 percent. What is the dollar value of the tax shield on that debt, just for this year, if Legitron is subject to a 27 percent marginal tax rate?

16.9 Interest tax shield benefit: FAJ, Inc., has $500 million of debt outstanding at an interest rate of 9 percent. What is the present value of the tax shield on that debt if it has no maturity and if FAJ is subject to a 30 percent marginal tax rate?

16.10 Interest tax shield benefit: Springer Corp. has $250 million of debt outstanding at an interest rate of 11 percent. What is the present value of the interest tax shield if the debt has no maturity and if Springer is subject to a 26 percent marginal tax rate?

16.11 Interest tax shield benefit: Structural Corp. currently has a cost of equity capital equal to 15 percent. Assume that the Modigliani and Miller Proposition 1 assumptions hold, with the exception of the assumption that there are no taxes, and that the firm’s capital structure consists of 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity. What is the weighted average cost of capital for the firm if the cost of debt is 10 percent and the firm is subject to a 28 percent marginal tax rate?

16.12 Practical considerations in capital structure choice: List and describe three practical considerations that concern managers when they make capital structure decisions.

Intermediate
16.13 M&M Proposition 1: Keyboard Chiropractic Clinic produces $300,000 of cash flow each year. The firm has no debt outstanding, and its cost of equity capital is 25 percent. The firm’s management would like to repurchase $600,000 of its equity by borrowing $600,000 at a rate of 8 percent per year. If we assume that the debt will be perpetual, find the cost of equity capital for Keyboard after it changes its capital structure. Assume that the Modigliani and Miller Proposition 1 assumptions hold.

16.14 M&M Proposition 1: Marx and Spender Corp. currently has a WACC of 21 percent. If the cost of debt capital for the firm is 12 percent and the firm is currently financed with 25 percent debt, then what is the current cost of equity capital for the firm? Assume that the assumptions in Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition 1 hold.

16.15 M&M Proposition 1: What is the effect on Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition 1 of relaxing the assumption that there are no information or transaction costs?

16.16 M&M Proposition 1: The weighted average cost of capital for a firm (assuming all three Modigliani and Miller Proposition 1 assumptions apply) is 15 percent. What is the current cost of equity capital for the firm if its cost of debt is 10 percent and the proportion of debt to total firm value for the firm is 0.5?

16.17 M&M Proposition 2: Mikos Processed Foods is currently valued at $500 million. Mikos will repurchase $100 million of its equity by issuing perpetual debt at an annual interest rate of 10 percent. Mikos is subject to a 30 percent marginal tax rate. If the Modigliani and Miller assumptions apply, except the assumption that there are no taxes, what will the value of Mikos be after the recapitalization?

16.18 M&M Proposition 2: Backwards Resources Company has a WACC of 12.6 percent, and it is subject to a 40 percent marginal tax rate. Backwards has $250 million of debt outstanding at an interest rate of 9 percent and $750 million of equity (at market value) outstanding. What is the expected return on the equity with this capital structure?

16.19 The costs of debt: Briefly discuss costs of financial distress to a firm that may arise when employees believe it is highly likely that the firm will declare bankruptcy.

16.20 The costs of debt: Santa’s Shoes is a retailer that has just begun having financial difficulty. Santa’s suppliers are aware of the increased possibility of bankruptcy. What might Santa’s suppliers do based on this information?

16.21 Stockholder–manager agency costs: Deficit Corp. management has determined that the firm will be $50 million short of being able to pay its debt obligations at the end of this year. Management has identified a positive NPV project that will require a great deal of effort on its part. However, this project is expected to generate only $40 million at the end of the year. Assume that all the members of Deficit’s management team will lose their jobs if the firm goes into bankruptcy at the end of the year. How likely is management to take the positive NPV project? If management declines the project, what kind of cost will Deficit’s stockholders incur?

16.22 Two theories of capital structure: Use the information in the following table to make a suggestion concerning the proportion of debt that the firm should utilize in its capital structure.

Benefit or (Cost)	No Debt	25%Debt	50%Debt	75%Debt
Tax shield	     $0	$10	  $20	  $30
Agency cost	−$10	−$5	  −$5	−$20
Financial distress cost	  −$1	−$3	−$10	−$10
16.23 Two theories of capital structure: Problem 16.22 introduces taxes and information and transaction costs to the simplified Modigliani and Miller model. If the marginal tax rate for the firm were to suddenly increase by a material amount, would the capital structure that maximizes the firm include less or more debt?

16.24 Two theories of capital structure: Describe how managers who subscribe to the pecking order theory of financing would rank the alternative sources of financing. Evaluate that ranking in terms of the costs of each source relative to the costs of other sources.

16.25 Two theories of capital structure: The pecking order theory suggests that managers prefer to first use internally generated equity to finance new projects. Does this preference mean that these funds represent an even cheaper source of funds than debt? Justify your answer.

16.26 The costs of debt: Discuss how the legal costs of financial distress may increase with the probability that a firm will formally declare bankruptcy, even if the firm has not reached that point yet.

Advanced
16.27 Operating a firm without debt is generally considered to be a conservative practice. Discuss how such a conservative approach to a firm’s capital structure is good or bad for the value of the firm in the absence of information or transaction costs and any effect of debt on the real investment policy of the firm.

16.28 Finite Corp. has $250 million of debt outstanding at an interest rate of 11 percent. What is the present value of the debt tax shield if the debt will mature in five years (and no new debt will replace the old debt), assuming that Finite is subject to a 40 percent marginal tax rate?

16.29 The Boring Corporation is currently valued at $900 million, but management wants to completely pay off its perpetual debt of $300 million. Boring is subject to a 30 percent marginal tax rate. If Boring pays off its debt, what will the total value of its equity be?

16.30 If we drop the assumption that there are no information or transaction costs, in addition to dropping the no-tax assumption, then will the Modigliani and Miller model still suggest that the firm should take on a greater proportion of debt in its capital structure? Explain.

16.31 PolyAna Corporation has such high cash flows that the company’s managers take Fridays off for a weekly luncheon in Cancun using the corporate jet. Describe how altering the capital structure of the firm might make the management of this firm stay in the office on Fridays in order to work on new positive NPV projects.

16.32 M&M Proposition 2 with taxes: Forwards Resources Company is currently an all-equity firm with a WACC of 14 percent and a 40 percent marginal tax rate. Forwards wants to move to a capital structure with $250 million of debt outstanding at an interest rate of 9 percent and a market value of equity equal to $750 million outstanding. Using M&M Proposition 2 with taxes, Equation 16.5, what is the expected return on equity at the new capital structure?

16.33 M&M Proposition 2 with taxes: You own all of the equity in a debt-free app development business that generates cash flows of $400,000 each year in perpetuity. The cost of assets, kAssets, is 10 percent, and the tax rate is 25 percent. What is the value of your all-equity firm? If you decide to replace $1 million of equity by borrowing $1 million at an interest rate of 6 percent, how much will the value of the firm increase? What would the kcs and WACC for your business be before and after the proposed financial restructuring?

Appendix: Leasing
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

A1. Describe what a lease is and discuss the motivations for leasing, what types of assets are more or less likely to be leased, what conflicts arise in lease agreements, and how the costs of these conflicts are reduced by lessors. Evaluate the choice between leasing and purchasing an asset.
Leasing is an alternative way of financing the acquisition of an asset. When the managers of a firm decide to acquire an asset, they can often choose between (1) purchasing the asset with a combination of debt and equity or (2) leasing it. A lease (or rental agreement) is a financial arrangement in which the user of an asset (the lessee) pays the owner of that asset (the lessor) to use it for a period of time.1

A lease divides the right to use an asset into two parts: (1) the right to use it during the term of the lease and (2) the right to use it after the lease ends—the salvage rights. The lessee pays for the right to use the asset during the term of the lease, while the lessor, who owns the asset, receives the lease payments in return for giving up the right to use the asset during the term of the lease. As an example, consider a rental agreement through which an oil company leases an oil drilling rig for six months. This lease gives the oil company (the lessee) the right to use the rig for six months in return for payments to the owner of the rig (the lessor). The owner retains all rights to use the rig after the agreement expires in six months.

Building Intuition
Leasing Is an Alternative Means of Financing the Acquisition of an Asset

When managers in a firm decide to acquire an asset, they often have a choice between purchasing the asset using debt and equity or leasing the asset. The firm gets the use of the asset in either case, but the ownership rights are different.

Virtually all firms lease some of their assets. Commonly leased assets include office space, furniture, computers, copy machines, cars, trucks, rail cars, airplanes, ships, and oil drilling rigs. The length of a lease can be as short as a few minutes (for example, when someone leases the use of a supercomputer to run a simulation) or as long as many years (as is common with leases involving office space).

Since leasing is an alternative means of financing the acquisition of an asset, whether leasing is more or less attractive than purchasing the asset depends on the same factors that affect the choice of how much debt and equity should be used to purchase an asset. In other words, the same three M&M conditions that affect the choice between debt and equity also affect the choice between leasing and purchasing an asset. If this choice affects firm value, it must be because of (1) taxes, (2) information or transaction costs, or (3) its effect on the real investment policy of the firm.

In this appendix we first describe the two general types of lease agreements that businesses enter into. We then use the M&M conditions to provide a framework for understanding why leasing can be more attractive than purchasing and what types of assets are more likely to be leased versus owned. We next examine the types of conflicts that arise between lessees and lessors and the different ways in which lessors limit the cost of these conflicts. Finally, we discuss how managers choose between purchasing and leasing an asset.

Two Types of Leases
The value of an asset to a lessor is equal to the sum of the present value of the lease payments that the lessor will receive plus the salvage value of the asset at the end of the lease. The present value of the lease payments, as a percentage of the total value of an asset, varies with the length of a lease agreement. For example, consider a rental company that both rents cars by the day and leases them for up to seven years. The value of a one-day rental fee will be very small compared to the total value of the car. If the daily rental fee for a $20,000 car is $50, this fee represents only 0.25 percent ($50/$20,000 = 0.0025, or 0.25 percent) of the total value. In contrast, the lease payments on a seven-year lease might have a present value that equals the entire $20,000 value of the car. In such a lease, the lessee is effectively paying as much as it would cost to buy the car and, since the salvage value is likely to be quite small after seven years, the lease payments represent most of the value that the lessor will receive from the car. Note that the seven-year lease is pretty close to an outright sale in which the lessor is selling the car to the lessee and providing 100 percent debt financing.

The fact that a lease can look like a sale is of concern to accountants and the IRS because accounting rules and tax laws treat leases and asset sales differently. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the IRS distinguish between leases that are truly rentals (known as operating leases) and leases that have the key elements of an outright sale (known as financial leases). Specifically, a lease is considered to be a financial lease if any of the following four conditions hold: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee at the end of the lease term; (2) the lease contains a bargain purchase option;2 (3) the lease period is at least 75 percent of the estimated economic life of the asset; or (4) the present value of the minimum lease payments is greater than 90 percent of the fair market value of the asset. If none of these conditions holds, then a lease is classified as an operating lease.

operating lease a lease that does not have the characteristics of a sale

financial lease a lease that has the characteristics of a sale

In 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) substantially updated its guidance for lease accounting. As of the beginning of 2019, public companies were required to account for both operating and financial leases, with terms of more than 12 months, as assets recorded on the lessee’s balance sheet, along with an offsetting liability equal to the present value of the lease payments. Prior to this change, firms were permitted to recognize an asset associated with an operating lease, but they were not required to record a liability associated with the lease obligation. Thus, operating leases were viewed as a form of off-balance-sheet financing, although many details of operating leases were disclosed elsewhere in the firm’s financial reports. The accounting firm Deloitte estimated that the new capitalization of operating leases would bring approximately $2 trillion in newly recognized liabilities onto the balance sheets of firms in the S&P 500.

The classification as either an operating or a financial lease has important implications for the lessee’s income statement and taxes. For operating leases, a lessee recognizes the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a pre-tax operating expense. For financial leases, the portion of the lease payment treated as an interest expense is deducted as a pre-tax operating expense, and the reduction of the lease liability as a financing expense.

Motivations for Leasing
The primary motivation for leasing an asset is that doing so can be a less expensive way of obtaining the use of the asset than purchasing it. We will use the M&M conditions to frame our discussion of how leasing can create value for stockholders.

Taxes

Let’s first consider how relaxing the M&M assumption that there are no taxes affects the choice between purchasing and leasing an asset. Suppose that you need a new delivery truck for your pizza restaurant business and that you can either (1) buy the truck outright using a loan or (2) lease the truck from a truck leasing company. Assume that the truck will cost $30,000 and will be depreciated for tax purposes using straight-line depreciation over three years to a salvage value of $0. Also assume that your business pays a marginal tax rate of 10 percent on its taxable income and that the truck leasing company, which is larger and more profitable, pays a marginal tax rate of 35 percent on its taxable income. Finally, assume that both you and the truck leasing company can finance the entire $30,000 purchase price with a 5 percent, three-year “balloon” loan from a bank. The entire face value of a balloon loan is repaid at the end of the life of the loan, which in this case is the end of the three-year life of the truck.

If you purchased the truck, you would receive a deduction of $10,000 per year for depreciation, and this would save you $10,000 × 0.10 = $1,000 per year in taxes. You would also save $150 each year in taxes because of the interest deduction ($30,000 × 0.05 × 0.10 = $150), for a total tax saving of $1,150. By comparison, if the truck leasing company purchased the truck, it would save $3,500 on its taxes each year because of the depreciation tax shield ($10,000 × 0.35 = $3,500) and $525 because of the interest deduction ($30,000 × 0.05 × 0.35 = $525). The truck leasing company’s total tax savings would be $3,500 + $525 = $4,025.

The difference between your total tax savings and that of the truck leasing company, $4,025 − $1,150 = $2,875, is a potential tax benefit that can be realized if you let the truck leasing company purchase the truck and lease it to you. Furthermore, if the monthly lease payments are set so that you and the truck leasing company split this $2,875 tax benefit, the leasing arrangement is a win-win situation. You get the use of the truck for less than it would cost you to buy it, and the truck leasing company profits from its share of the tax savings.

Reducing the combined tax obligations of two companies can provide an important motivation for leasing. The delivery truck example illustrates how a lease contract can increase stockholder value when the company that uses an asset has a lower marginal tax rate than the lessor company. These types of tax differences, which exist between companies within countries as well as between companies in different countries, contribute to the wide range of leasing opportunities that exist today.

Information and Transaction Costs

Tax savings represent only one potential source of savings from lease contracts. A lease can also be used to reduce information and transaction costs. Furthermore, differences across types of assets in the extent to which information and transaction costs can be reduced provide us with insights as to what types of assets are more or less likely to be leased.

Information and Transaction Cost Motivations for Leasing
To see how leasing can reduce information and transaction costs, consider the choice between buying and leasing a car. The cost of acquiring a car and of selling it after you have finished using it can be quite high. When individuals purchase a car, they typically spend a considerable amount of time learning about the alternative makes and models that are being offered for sale, visiting dealerships, taking test drives, negotiating the price, and so on. Similarly, selling a car can require spending time searching for a buyer and negotiating and completing the sale. While it can make sense to incur such information and transaction costs if you are going to keep a car for several years, it makes no sense to do this if you only plan to use the car for a few days. This is the main reason that there is such a large car rental industry. Car rental companies incur the information and transaction costs associated with buying and selling a car and spread them across a large number of short-term renters, thereby reducing the cost of obtaining the use of a car for a few days. The same motivation explains the short-term rental agreements for assets like power tools, moving trucks, and aircraft.

Of course, individuals and businesses also often lease cars for several years at a time. While the information and transaction costs associated with purchasing and selling a car are spread out (amortized) over a longer period and are therefore smaller on a per-day basis, there are circumstances under which it can still make sense to enter into a leasing contract. For example, a company can find it less costly to lease the cars in its fleet because a leasing company is able to manage the fleet, including activities such as providing regular maintenance, more efficiently. Furthermore, because the leasing company buys and sells a lot of cars in the ordinary course of its business, it is likely to be able to acquire cars at a lower price and to realize a higher value from used car sales. Cost reductions such as these contribute to the prevalence of long-term lease agreements on assets like copiers, computers, and office space, as well as vehicles.

Finally, lease agreements in business are often written with clauses that allow the lessee to terminate the agreement before the end of the lease term by providing 60 or 90 days’ notice to the lessor. Early termination provisions like these provide the lessee with operational flexibility. For example, in the airline industry early termination provisions enable managers to rapidly, and at relatively low cost, adjust fleet sizes during economic downturns by reducing the number of leased aircraft. This flexibility is valuable to airlines because the opportunity cost of the capital tied up in an idle airplane is high. For example, if the cost of capital for an airline is 10 percent, the opportunity cost of capital that is tied up in a $150 million aircraft is $15 million per year.

Why Certain Types of Assets Are Leased
Information and transaction costs can also help to explain what types of assets are leased rather than owned by companies. In order to see why this is true, you must be familiar with the concepts of a firm-specific asset and a general-use asset. A firm-specific asset is an asset that is substantially more valuable to a particular firm than to any other firm. For example, the big signs with company names that you often see on the tops of office buildings are firm-specific assets. Such a sign is valuable to the company whose name is on it, but virtually worthless to any other firm. Similarly, a company that has a proprietary manufacturing process might use custom-made equipment in that process that would be of little value to any other company. In contrast, a general-use asset is of similar value to many potential users. Examples include office buildings and office equipment.

general-use asset an asset that is of similar value to many potential users

Firm-specific assets are leased less frequently than general-use assets because it is easier for one party to engage in opportunistic behavior that harms the other party when a firm-specific asset is leased. To see why this is the case, suppose that managers at Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical firm, have decided to replace an old manufacturing plant. Instead of owning the new plant, they are in discussions with potential investors who would build the plant to Pfizer’s specifications using their own money and then lease it to Pfizer.

Assume that the plant will cost $50 million and will have a useful life of 20 years. Also assume that while it will be worth $50 million to Pfizer, the highest price any other general user would pay for the plant is $40 million. In other words, the plant is a firm-specific asset in which $10 million of the value can be realized only by Pfizer. Finally, assume that the firm-specific and general-use values of the plant both decline in a straight line over its 20-year life, as illustrated in the following table:

Value
Value component	Year 0	Year 10	Year 20
Pfizer-specific	$10 mil	 $5 mil	 $0 mil
General-use	$40 mil	 $20 mil	 $0 mil
Pfizer managers do not want finance the plant themselves, so they decide to propose a leasing arrangement that would be recognized as an operating lease. In particular, they decide to propose paying the investors for making the investment using two consecutive 10-year operating leases. In order to avoid financial lease treatment, both Pfizer management and the investors know that the first agreement cannot specify any of the conditions in the second lease. In other words, all of the terms of the second lease will be negotiated in 10 years. The Pfizer managers propose to the investors that the value of the lease payments over the first 10-year lease should be $25 million, since the lease will cover half of the life of the $50 million facility.

This proposal concerns the investors. They worry that at the end of the first lease, Pfizer managers won’t agree to lease payments in the second lease that have a value equal to the remaining $25 million that they invested. Since Pfizer managers know that the plant will be worth only $20 million to another user in Year 10, the investors are afraid that if they accept $25 million in the first lease, Pfizer managers will offer them only $20 million for the second lease and that they will end up losing $5 million ($50 million invested − $25 million from first lease − $20 million from second lease = $5 million). This is what economists call a hold-up problem.

To avoid the potential for a hold-up, the investors respond to Pfizer management by proposing that the payments for the first lease be set so that their total present value equals $30 million. This way, regardless of whether Pfizer leases the plant in the last 10 years, the investors will recover their investment. Unfortunately, while protecting the investors from the hold-up problem, this proposal subjects Pfizer to its own hold-up problem. Specifically, in Year 10 when it is time to renew the lease, the investors will know that use of the plant in the last 10 years of its life will be worth $25 million to Pfizer and that Pfizer would have to pay $25 million to obtain a comparable plant. Knowing this, the investors are likely to demand more than $20 million in the second lease. In fact, they would be able to charge Pfizer up to $25 million. If they did this, use of the plant for 20 years would end up costing Pfizer $55 million ($30 million + $25 million = $55 million). Pfizer would be better off building the plant itself for $50 million.

There is no easy solution to this contracting problem. Both parties will be concerned about being held up because they cannot agree, in writing, on the terms for the second lease without the overall transaction being classified as a financial lease. The potential for this sort of problem arises whenever someone considers leasing a firm-specific asset. As a result, firm-specific assets are rarely leased. Because general-use assets tend to have a similar value to any number of users, they are not as subject to hold-up problems and therefore are more likely to be leased. Examples of commonly leased assets include transportation equipment, such as cars, trucks, rail cars, and planes, office furniture and equipment, such as copiers and computers, buildings with general office and retail space, and construction and oil drilling equipment.

Real Investment Policy

Even in the absence of taxes and information and transaction cost considerations, having the ability to structure lease agreements can affect stockholder value by changing the real investment opportunities that are available to a firm. For example, managers at manufacturing firms can sometimes use lease contracts to maximize the value of a product line by charging a higher price to customers who are willing to pay more and yet still making their products accessible to customers who are not willing to pay as much.

To see how this might be done, consider a manufacturing company that has developed a new product for which there is limited direct competition in the market. The manufacturer can choose whether to sell the product or just make it available through lease contracts.3 Leasing provides more flexibility in setting prices than selling the product. For example, suppose a manufacturing firm has two types of customers. One type of customer is not willing to pay much more than the marginal cost to the manufacturing firm of producing its product because these customers won’t be using it very intensively. The other type of customer is willing to pay considerably more than the marginal cost because these customers will get a lot of use out of the asset. In a situation like this, the company can set a lease price that provides the company a modest return for producing an additional unit of the product, but that limits the product’s use. The high-volume users who are willing to pay more can be charged higher prices based on their usage levels. Products such as office copiers, telephones, and TV cable boxes have all been made available to consumers with such leasing schemes at one time or another.

It is worth noting that a firm can achieve similar results by using a combination of sales and leasing. This is done by setting a high sales price and a lower lease price for modest usage. The high-volume users will pay a high price to purchase the product, and low-volume users will lease.

Regardless of which strategy is used, using leases to charge different prices to different customers affects the mix of real assets within a firm. A firm that leases the products it manufactures will have different assets than a firm that only sells its products. The former will be in both the manufacturing and leasing businesses while the latter will be only in manufacturing.

Conflicts between Lessees and Lessors
Separating the right to use an asset during the term of a lease from the right to use the asset afterward creates two natural conflicts of interest between lessees and lessors. These conflicts concern how intensely the asset is used and how well it is maintained during the term of the lease. The intensity of use and maintenance conflicts lead to what we refer to as the asset abuse problem in leasing. The asset abuse problem can increase the cost of leasing for the lessor when it is not controlled.

Intensity of Use Conflict
This conflict arises because the lessee can have an incentive to use a leased asset more intensely than the lessor would prefer. As long as using the asset more intensely does not significantly affect the lessee’s ability to use it during the lease term, the lessee does not have an incentive to be concerned about how intensely the asset is used. To the extent that more intense use reduces the value of the asset, this reduction is borne by the lessor. For example, if you rent a car for a week you are unlikely to be concerned about driving it too many miles. On the other hand, the company that leases it to you is likely to be concerned. If rental car customers average 1,000 miles a week instead of 500 miles a week, the value of a rental fleet will decline more rapidly.

Maintenance Conflict
To the extent that cutting back on maintenance expenditures does not significantly affect a lessee’s ability to use a leased asset, the lessee has an incentive to spend less on maintenance than the lessor would like. Spending less on maintenance, or avoiding it altogether, can save the lessee money and time, but it can also reduce the asset’s salvage value and increase the out-of-pocket maintenance costs for the lessor.

Building Intuition
Splitting the Rights to an Asset between the Lessee and Lessor Can Create Costly Conflicts

Separating the right to use an asset during the term of a lease from the right to use the asset afterward creates conflicts concerning how intensely the asset is used and how well it is maintained during the term of the lease. These conflicts can increase the cost of leasing.

The intensity of use and maintenance conflicts are related. The quantity of services that an asset will provide over its life is generally related to how well it is maintained. Cutting back on maintenance can magnify the negative effects of using an asset more intensely.

Lessors know all about the intensity of use and maintenance conflicts and do various things to protect themselves. It is important to recognize that it only makes sense to lease an asset if the lessor can reduce the cost of the asset abuse problem so that it is smaller than the benefits of leasing. Lessors can reduce the cost of asset abuse problems by doing the following:

Invest in assets that are less subject to abuse: For example, hotel operators invest in room furniture that is durable and less likely to show abuse. They know that people tend to take better care of their own furniture than furniture in hotels, and so they tend to avoid purchasing furniture that shows wear and tear or breaks easily. This is why, even in some of the best hotels, the furniture is made of veneer-covered particle board.
Price the lease so that the expected return on invested capital is equal to its opportunity cost: In doing this, lessors factor in the expected costs associated with asset abuse and under-maintenance. A higher rental price compensates the lessor for the greater susceptibility to asset abuse. This is the reason that lease prices are so high for assets that are more subject to abuse. You will see this if you ever rent an exotic sports car. The rental price for just a few hours can easily be several hundred dollars. Unfortunately, pricing the lease to compensate for asset abuse costs can also make the problem worse because it discourages people who are less likely to abuse an asset from leasing it.
Track the total services obtained from the asset and charge the lessee based on usage: This reduces the incentive for the lessee to use the asset intensively and compensates the lessor if the lessee does so. An example of tracking usage and pricing based on it is seen in Ryder or U-Haul truck rental agreements. In these agreements, the base rental price includes a prespecified number of miles that the truck can be driven. The lessee must pay an additional per-mile charge for each mile the truck is driven over that limit.
Require a damage deposit: Such deposits are commonly required in lease agreements involving apartments or other assets where it is easy to observe abuse. They provide an incentive for the lessee not to abuse the asset and make it easier for the lessor to recover the cost if the asset is abused.
Bundle the lease contract with a service contract: Where under-maintenance is of particular concern, lessors often bundle a maintenance (service) contract with the lease contract. In other words, the lessee must purchase a maintenance contract along with the lease. Since the lessee simply has to make a phone call (or, for a vehicle, bring it to the shop) in order to have maintenance performed, he or she is more likely to do so.
Place explicit restrictions on how an asset may be used: Bundling a maintenance contract with a lease might work well with an asset such as a copier where you are dealing with ordinary maintenance. However, it will be less effective with an asset like a car where you are also concerned about how it is used. For this reason, auto leasing companies often place restrictions on the use of leased vehicles. For example, they might prohibit driving the vehicle off-road or hauling a trailer with a weight in excess of a prespecified limit. Restrictions on use also take other forms, such as prohibitions on the commercial use of a piece of equipment that is designed for home use or limits on subleasing office space or an apartment.
Provide the lessee with the right to buy the asset when the lease expires: Having the right to buy the asset gives the lessee an option on the salvage rights. This reduces the lessee’s incentive to abuse the asset during the lease term.
Evaluating a Leasing Opportunity
As we stated earlier, the primary motivation for leasing an asset is that doing so can be a less expensive way of obtaining the use of the asset than purchasing it. In other words, despite the intensity of use and maintenance conflicts, leasing an asset can create more value for stockholders than purchasing the asset. This value can come from larger tax shields, the flexibility that short-term leasing can provide, and reduced contracting costs, among other benefits.

The analytical techniques that are used to choose between buying and leasing an asset are identical to those used in capital budgeting. Analysts typically use NPV analysis. Since the asset that would be purchased is often exactly the same as the asset that would be leased, many of the cash flows associated with the use of the asset are the same regardless of whether the asset is owned or leased. These identical cash flows, which often include the revenues and costs of goods sold associated with the sale of products produced using the leased asset, can be ignored when comparing the two alternatives. For this reason, the NPV values in a buy versus lease analysis only reflect cash flows that are not the same between the two alternatives. To see how this analysis is done, consider the following example.

The owner of a small furniture manufacturing company in Athens, Ohio, has to replace an old wood lathe that has reached the end of its useful life. She is considering either buying or leasing a replacement lathe. Under either alternative, she plans to use the lathe in her business for only six years, even though its economic life is expected to be considerably longer. Assume that the furniture manufacturing company has a marginal tax rate of 25 percent.

Lease alternative: The company that manufactures the lathe offers a leasing option under which the furniture manufacturing company can lease the lathe for an annual lease payment of $3,400 per year. With this option, the lessor will be responsible for maintenance of the lathe and will take it back after six years. The lease will be classified as an operating lease under the accounting and tax rules.
Purchase alternative: It would cost $20,000 to purchase the replacement lathe, and a local bank has offered to lend the entire amount to the company at an interest rate of 8 percent. The loan would be a six-year balloon loan in which the company would not have to repay any of the principal until the loan matures in six years. The lathe would be depreciated using the five-year MACRS depreciation method shown in Exhibit 11.5. As a percentage of the purchase price, the annual depreciation deductions would be 20 percent, 32 percent, 19.2 percent, 11.52 percent, 11.52 percent, and 5.76 percent in Years 1 through 6, respectively. Maintenance of the lathe would cost $500 per year, and the lathe is expected to have a salvage value of $10,000 after six years.
Analysis: Assuming that the revenues and cost of goods sold associated with the use of the lathe are the same under either alternative, we can ignore these cash flows in comparing the two alternatives. In making this assumption, we are also assuming that the asset abuse problem is not an important concern with this lease. There are two reasons this is reasonable in this situation. First, the manufacturing company is unlikely to significantly alter its production rates just to use this one machine more intensely. Second, the maintenance arrangement, which bundles a service contract with the lease contract, will limit the maintenance conflict.
With the above information, the analysis of the lease versus purchase options involves calculating the present value of the after-tax cash flows that are unique to each of them.

Exhibit A16.1 shows the annual after-tax cash flows and the NPV for the lease alternative. Since the lease is an operating lease, the furniture manufacturing company will be able to deduct the entire lease payment when calculating its taxes each year. Furthermore, since the lathe will be owned, maintained, and depreciated by the lessor, the lessee does not have to worry about the cash flows associated with the purchase or sale of the lathe, maintenance, or depreciation deductions. The NPV of the after-tax cash flows associated with the lease is −$12,539.18.4

The cash flows that are unique to the purchase option are the interest and principal payments associated with the loan, the tax savings associated with the depreciation of the lathe, the cost of the maintenance, and the salvage value of the lathe after six years. Exhibit A16.2 illustrates how the annual after-tax value of these cash flows and their NPV are calculated and shows that the present value of these cash flows is −$12,293.67. This NPV represents the total cost of obtaining the use of this machine for six years if it is purchased.

Since the after-tax cost of leasing the wood lathe for six years is greater than the after-tax cost of owning it for six years (the NPV is more negative), the owner of the furniture manufacturing company should purchase the lathe.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE A16.1
Lease or Purchase Decision

Situation

You work for a courier firm that offers fast physical delivery of packages in downtown New York City (Manhattan). If someone wants to have a package delivered before the postal service or one of the big courier firms, such as FedEx or UPS, can deliver it, he or she will call your office and you will send a courier on a bicycle to pick up the package and make the delivery. Your couriers have used their own bicycles up to this point, but you have decided that it conveys a more professional image if they use identical bicycles with your company’s logo on them. A bicycle manufacturing company has offered to lease or sell you the bicycles that you want. After performing an NPV analysis, you find that the NPV associated with leasing a bicycle for two years is −$545.12 and that the NPV associated with purchasing and maintaining the same bicycle is −$515.00. Should you purchase or lease the bicycles?

Summary of Learning Objectives
A1 Describe what a lease is and discuss the motivations for leasing, what types of assets are more or less likely to be leased, what conflicts arise in lease agreements, and how the costs of these conflicts are reduced by lessors. Evaluate the choice between leasing and purchasing an asset.

A lease is a financial contract that divides the right to use an asset into two parts: (1) the right to use it during the term of the lease and (2) the right to use it after the lease expires (the salvage rights). Leasing is an alternative to purchasing an asset when someone wants to obtain the right to use the asset for a period of time. The primary motivation for leasing an asset is that it can be less expensive than purchasing the asset. Leasing can provide larger tax shields, greater flexibility, and reduced contracting costs. General-use assets are more likely to be leased because the hold-up problem will be less severe with them than with firm-specific assets. Because of the way a lease divides the right to use an asset, it leads to conflicts concerning how intensely the asset is used and how well it is maintained. Ways in which lessors limit the costs of these conflicts include (1) investing in assets that are less subject to abuse, (2) pricing leases to reflect expected abuse, (3) tracking how intensely the leased assets are used and charging based on that intensity of use, (4) requiring damage deposits, (5) bundling lease and service contracts, (6) restricting how the assets can be used, and (7) offering the lessees the right to purchase the assets at the end of the lease. The analytical techniques that are used to choose between buying and leasing an asset are identical to those used in capital budgeting.

Self-Study Problem
A16.1 You own a real estate investment firm and have been asked by the owner of Big Box Shipping Company if you would be willing to construct an office building and lease it to Big Box. The owner of Big Box has some very unusual requirements for the interior layout of the building and is only willing to commit to leasing the building for 10 years, even though the life of the building is likely to be many times that long. What should concern you about this proposal?



Discussion Questions
A16.1 Your boss just read an article about the tax benefits of leasing. He states that your firm should lease all of its assets, since it faces a low tax rate. How would you respond?

A16.2 Leasing: Fresno Machine Shop management has decided to acquire a new machine that costs $3,000. The machine will be worthless after three years. Only straight-line depreciation is allowed by the IRS for this type of machine. ABC Leasing, Inc., offers to lease the same machine to Fresno under an operating lease. Annual lease payments are $1,200 per year and are due at the end of each of the three years. The market-wide borrowing rate is 8 percent for loans on assets such as this. Fresno’s marginal tax rate is 35 percent. Should Fresno lease the machine or buy it? Assume that Fresno would not borrow to purchase the machine.

Advanced
A16.3 Your firm is considering leasing a chromebook laptop computer. The lease would last for three years and require four payments of $100 per year, with the first payment due immediately. The computer would cost $360 to buy and would be depreciated using straight-line depreciation over three years to a salvage value of zero. The actual salvage value is expected to be $100 after three years. The borrowing rate is 10 percent for loans on assets such as this, and your firm’s marginal tax rate is 25 percent. Should your firm lease or buy the computer?

Notes
1 These are the types of securities that firms issue to finance the assets that they purchase. However, it is important to recognize that firms do not purchase all assets they use. Many assets that businesses use are leased (rented). A lease (rental) agreement can enable a business to obtain the use of an asset without purchasing it. Consequently, the asset and its associated lease financing might not show up on the company’s balance sheet. Also, since business lease agreements generally require no deposit, they essentially represent 100 percent debt financing. For these reasons, the decision to purchase or lease an asset is directly related to the capital structure choices that managers make. The appendix to this chapter discusses lease agreements and how managers choose between buying and leasing an asset.
2 The Nobel Prize Committee cited the M&M propositions when it awarded Nobel Prizes in Economics to Professor Modigliani in 1985 and to Professor Miller in 1990.
3 Since we are assuming that there are no taxes, the after-tax cost of the interest is $10.
4 In order for this transaction to have precisely the same effect as if Millennium’s capital structure had been altered by management, you would also have to use the firm’s stock as the only collateral for this borrowing. That way, if you failed to pay the interest, you would forfeit the equity to the lender and have no further obligation. The assumption that you can borrow at the same rate as the firm and use the stock as collateral is implied by the M&M condition that there are no information or transaction costs. If you paid a higher interest rate than the firm, then some of the value you are entitled to receive from the firm would be transferred from you to the lender.
5 In finance, we use the terms cost of debt or equity interchangeably with required return on debt or equity because, by definition, the pretax cost of a particular type of capital to a firm equals the rate of return that investors require. Note that since firms can deduct interest payments, the after-tax cost of debt to the firm will be lower than the rate of return required by its creditors.
6 M&M assumed that the cost of debt was constant and equal to the risk-free rate when they derived their Proposition 2. Of course, we know that the rate of return required by investors increases with risk and that the riskiness of the interest and principal payments on debt increases with leverage. Therefore, the cost of debt must also increase with leverage. If you look carefully at Equation 16.3, you will notice that (kAssets − kDebt) gets smaller as leverage increases because, although kDebt gets larger, kAssets does not change. Although this suggests that kcs can get smaller as leverage increases (specifically, the decrease in kAssets − kDebt might more than offset the increase in VDebt/Vcs), this never happens in practice. The cost of common stock always increases with leverage.
7 In previous chapters, we discussed a number of reasons that net income might differ from the cash flows to which stockholders have a claim. For example, accounting accruals may cause net income to differ from cash flows, or depreciation charges might not equal actual cash expenditures on capital equipment or working capital in a particular year. For the time being, we will ignore these potential complications.
8 Recall from Chapter 12 that operating leverage is a measure of the relative amounts of fixed and variable costs in a project’s cost structure. The greater the proportion of total costs that are fixed, the higher the operating leverage. Operating leverage is the major factor that determines the sensitivity of operating profit (EBIT) to changes in revenue. The higher a project’s operating leverage, the greater this sensitivity.
9 In Exhibit 16.3, the percentage decrease in net income is 1.75 times as large in the firm with financial leverage as it is in the firm without financial leverage, regardless of whether the firm has low or high operating leverage (−56.00 percent/−32.00 percent = 1.75 and −140.00 percent/−80.00 percent = 1.75). This is because the fixed-interest expense in this example is the same percentage of revenue in both businesses.
10 This effect is offset somewhat by the fact that dividends and capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than interest income in individual income tax returns. This effect is secondary to the corporate income tax effect because it is smaller in magnitude and because many investors, such as pension funds, endowments, and foundations, pay no taxes at all.

12 Since internally generated funds are reinvested on behalf of the stockholders, the true cost of these funds equals the cost of equity. However, using internally generated funds enables the firm to avoid the issuance costs associated with borrowing or selling stock, which, in turn, can make internal funds most attractive.
1 A rental agreement is a lease that involves tangible property.
2 A bargain purchase option is an option to buy the asset at a price that is so low, relative to the expected fair market value of the property, that exercise of the option is reasonably assured.
3 In practice, the leasing alternative would be accomplished by setting up a leasing subsidiary that is owned by the manufacturer.
4 Note that we used the after-tax cost of the 8 percent loan as the discount rate. We did this because the bank has agreed to lend the company the entire $20,000 purchase price at that rate and the lease is effectively 100 percent debt financing. We can assume that the risk associated with the lease cash flows is the same as that associated with the loan cash flows. It only makes sense to do this if the bank would lend the entire amount at that rate without any guarantees from the furniture manufacturing company or its owner. If there were such guarantees, using the 8 percent stated cost of debt would understate the true cost of 100 percent debt financing.

Dividends, Stock Repurchases, and Payout Policy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Explain what a dividend is, and describe the different types of dividends and the dividend payment process. Calculate the expected change in a stock’s price around an ex-dividend date.
Explain what a stock repurchase is and how companies repurchase their stock. Calculate how taxes affect the after-tax proceeds that a stockholder receives from a dividend and from a stock repurchase.

Define stock dividends and stock splits, and explain how they differ from other types of dividends and from stock repurchases.
Describe factors that managers consider when setting the dividend payouts for their firms.
On March 3, 2020, managers at Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., the international hotel company, announced that its board of directors had authorized a significant increase in its share repurchase program. The revision allowed management to repurchase as much as $2.3 billion of Hilton stock on the open market. In a press release that day, the company indicated that the actual amount and timing of future repurchases would depend on a variety of factors, including the company’s overall liquidity, cash flow, and market conditions. Hilton also noted that the program did not obligate the company to repurchase a specific dollar amount of its stock, and the program could be suspended or discontinued at any time.

The 2020 repurchase plan was part of Hilton’s broader policy to regularly distribute cash to the company’s stockholders. Since its inception in 2017, the Hilton repurchase program had acquired approximately 56 million shares for about $4.4 billion. In addition, the company paid a regular quarterly dividend to its common stockholders. In March 2020, shareholders received a quarterly dividend of $0.15 for each share of common stock they owned, and in all of 2019, stockholders of the company received total dividends of $0.60 per share. Dividend payouts per share had remained at the same level of $0.60 per year since 2015.

The decision in early 2020 to keep quarterly cash dividends flat year-over-year, while increasing its stock repurchase program, most likely reflected uncertainty Hilton managers faced regarding the company’s future profitability and capital requirements. With cash dividends equal to nearly 20 percent ($0.60/$3.05 = 0.197, or 19.7 percent) of 2019 earnings per share, committing to a higher regular dividend might have placed the company in a bind if earnings suddenly dropped or an investment opportunity arose that required substantial capital. In contrast, the repurchase program provided Hilton managers with the flexibility to distribute excess cash to stockholders without committing to making regular distributions. In hindsight, the caution of Hilton management was well founded. By the end of March 2020, the Covid 19 pandemic was having a major impact on the company’s bottom line, forcing management to completely suspend future dividend payments and the stock repurchase program.

The trade-off between regular cash dividends and stock repurchases is one that is faced by managers whenever they decide how to distribute excess cash to stockholders. Dividends have historically been a more popular means of distributing cash, but this is not always the case. For example, for several years leading up to the great recession of 2008, the total dollar value distributed by U.S. public firms through stock repurchases exceeded that distributed through dividends. This chapter discusses concepts that help us understand why managers make the dividend and stock repurchase decisions we observe in practice. It also helps us understand why firms distribute capital to stockholders and the implications of such distributions.

Chapter Preview
In Chapter 16, we discussed factors that influence capital structure decisions at firms. In this chapter, we look at some different but related financing decisions—those concerning how and when to return value (cash or other assets) to stockholders.

We begin by describing the various types of dividends and the dividend payment process. We then discuss stock repurchases as an alternative to dividends. Stock repurchases are a potential component of any payout policy because, like dividends, they are a means of distributing value to stockholders.

We next examine the benefits and costs associated with making dividend payments and describe how stock prices react when a company makes an announcement about future dividend payments. These discussions provide insights into the ways in which payout policies affect firm value. We end this part of the chapter by directly comparing the benefits and costs of dividends with those of stock repurchases.

We then describe stock splits and stock dividends and discuss the reasons managers might want to split their company’s stock or pay a stock dividend. Finally, we conclude the chapter with a discussion of factors that managers and their boards of directors consider when they set payout policies.

17.1 Dividends
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what a dividend is, and describe the different types of dividends and the dividend payment process. Calculate the expected change in a stock’s price around an ex-dividend date.
Decisions concerning whether to distribute value to stockholders, how much to distribute, and how best to distribute it are very important financing decisions that have implications for a firm’s future investment and capital structure policies. Any time value is distributed to a firm’s stockholders, the amount of equity capital invested in the firm is reduced. Unless the firm raises additional equity by selling new shares, distributions to stockholders reduce the availability of capital for new investments and increase the firm’s financial leverage.

The term payout policy refers to a firm’s overall policy regarding distributions of value to stockholders. In this section, we discuss the use of dividends to distribute this value. A dividend is something of value that is distributed to a firm’s stockholders on a pro-rata basis—that is, in proportion to the percentage of the firm’s shares that they own. A dividend can involve the distribution of cash, assets, or something else, such as discounts on the firm’s products that are available only to stockholders.

Building Intuition
Dividends Reduce the Stockholders’ Investment in a Firm

A dividend reduces the stockholders’ investment in a firm by distributing some of that investment to them. The value that stockholders receive through a dividend was already theirs. A dividend simply takes this value out of the firm and returns it to them.

When a firm distributes value through a dividend, it reduces the value of the stockholders’ claims against the firm. To see this, consider a firm that has $1,000 in cash plus other assets that have a market value of $9,000. If the firm has no debt and 10,000 shares are outstanding, what is the value of each share? Each share of this firm is worth $1, since the total value of the cash and the other assets is $10,000 and the stockholders own it all.

Now, suppose management distributes the $1,000 of cash as a dividend. Each stockholder receives 10 cents ($1,000/10,000 shares = $0.10) for each share that he or she owns, and the value of each share declines to 90 cents. This is true because the firm is now worth $9,000 and there are still 10,000 shares. Note that each stockholder still has $1 of value for each share owned, but the share represents only 90 cents of the total. The other 10 cents is in the hands of the stockholder, who can spend or reinvest it.1

Types of Dividends
As mentioned, dividends can take various forms. The most common form is the regular cash dividend, which is a cash dividend that is paid on a regular basis. These dividends are generally paid quarterly and are a common means by which firms return some of their profits to stockholders. In 2020, over 4,000 public companies paid dividends to their investors. The aggregate dividends paid to investors in S&P 500 companies was $483.2 billion.2 The dividend payments made by the vast majority of these firms were part of regular cash dividend payment programs.

regular cash dividend a cash dividend that is paid on a regular basis, typically quarterly

In the chapter opener, you saw that in early 2020 Hilton was paying a regular cash dividend of $0.15 each quarter. The size of a firm’s regular cash dividend is typically set at a level that management expects the company to be able to maintain in the long run. This is because, barring some major change in the fortunes of the company, management does not want to reduce the dividend. As we will discuss later, stock market investors often view a dividend reduction negatively.

Management can afford to err on the side of setting the regular cash dividend too low because it always has the option of paying an extra dividend if earnings are higher than expected. Extra dividends are often paid at the same time as regular cash dividends, and some companies use them to ensure that a minimum portion of earnings is distributed to stockholders each year. For example, suppose that the management of a company wants to distribute 40 percent of the company’s net income to stockholders each year. If the company earns $2 per share in a particular year and the regular cash dividend is 60 cents per share, management can pay an extra 20-cent dividend at the end of the year to ensure that the company hits its 40 percent payout target [($0.60 + $0.20)/$2.00 = 0.40, or 40 percent].

extra dividend a dividend that is generally paid at the same time as a regular cash dividend to distribute additional value

A special dividend, like an extra dividend, is a one-time payment to stockholders. However, special dividends tend to be considerably larger than extra dividends. They are normally used to distribute unusually large amounts of cash. For instance, a company might use a special dividend to distribute excess cash from operations that has accumulated over time. Microsoft did this in a very dramatic way in 2004 when it paid a $32.4 billion special dividend. Special dividends are a relatively common distribution of excess cash. In a more recent, but less dramatic, example, Wingstop, Inc., paid $148 million in total ($5 per share to each of its shareholders) on December 3, 2020. A special dividend might also be used to distribute the proceeds from the sale of a major asset or business or as a means of altering a company’s capital structure.

special dividend a one-time payment to stockholders that is normally used to distribute a large amount of value

Sealed Air Corporation, the company that first produced those plastic sheets of packaging materials with the air bubbles, provides a good example of how a special dividend can be used to dramatically change a company’s capital structure. In April 1989, Sealed Air borrowed $306.7 million, which it combined with cash it already had on hand to pay a $40 per share ($329.8 million) dividend. Since the price of Sealed Air’s stock was only about $45 before the dividend, most of the equity was distributed to stockholders. The net effect of borrowing the money to pay a large dividend like this was to substantially increase the debt-to-total-capital ratio at Sealed Air—from 8.1 percent to more than 76.2 percent.3 Sealed Air senior management increased the company’s leverage so dramatically in order to provide managers at all levels with incentives to focus on maximizing the firm’s cash flows. We discussed this potential benefit from using debt financing in Chapter 16.

A liquidating dividend is a dividend that is paid to stockholders when a firm is liquidated. When we say that a firm is liquidated, we mean that its assets are sold; the proceeds from the sale of the assets are distributed to creditors, stockholders, and others who have a claim on the firm’s assets; and the firm ceases to exist. In the United States, the proceeds from the sale of a company’s assets are first used to pay all wages owed to employees, and satisfy obligations to suppliers, lenders, the various taxing authorities, and any other party that has a claim on those assets. Only after all of these obligations are satisfied can the company pay a liquidating dividend to the stockholders. These priorities highlight the fact that the stockholders are truly the residual claimants to a firm’s assets.

liquidating dividend the final dividend that is paid to stockholders when a firm is liquidated

Beyond the payments described above, distributions of value to stockholders can also take the form of discounts on the company’s products, free samples, and the like. Often, these noncash distributions are not thought of as dividends, in part because the value received by stockholders is not in the form of cash and in part because the value received by individual stockholders does not often reflect their proportional ownership in the firm.

For example, CSX Corporation used to own a high-end resort in West Virginia called the Greenbrier. CSX stockholders received a discount on the cost of their hotel rooms when they stayed at the Greenbrier. For a three- or four-day stay, this discount could easily equal the value of the regular cash dividend for someone who owned 200 shares. However, the value of the discount was exactly the same for someone who owned 1 million shares. Obviously, for this large stockholder the value of the discount would be small compared with the value of the cash dividend. Note that the discount could actually exceed the total value of the shares owned by a stockholder who only had five or ten shares!

More recently, AMC Entertainment, which owns and operates over 1000 movie theaters in the U.S. and internationally, has begun to offer its investors special perks when they visit AMC theaters. For example, in the summer of 2021, the company offered each of its stockholders a free large popcorn!

The Dividend Payment Process
A relatively standard sequence of events takes place before a dividend is paid. This process is more easily defined for companies with publicly traded stock than for private companies. For this reason, we first focus on the process for public companies and then discuss how it differs for private companies. The time line for the sequence of events in the dividend payment process at a public company is illustrated in Exhibit 17.1.

EXHIBIT 17.1 The Dividend Payment Process Time Line for a Public Company The dividend payment process begins when the board votes to pay a dividend. Shortly afterward, the firm publicly announces its intent to pay a dividend, along with, typically, the amount of the dividend, the ex-dividend date, and the record date. The record date is the date by which an investor must be a stockholder of record in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date, which is set by the stock exchange, normally precedes the record date by two days and is the date before which an investor must buy the stock to be a stockholder of record on the record date. The payable date is the date on which the firm actually pays the dividend.


The Board Vote

The process begins with a vote by a company’s board of directors to pay a dividend. As stockholder representatives, the board must approve any distribution of value to stockholders.

The Public Announcement

After the board vote, the company announces to the public that it will pay the dividend. The date on which this announcement is made is known as the declaration date, or announcement date, of the dividend. The announcement typically includes the amount of value that stockholders will receive for each share of stock that they own, as well as the other dates associated with the dividend payment process.

declaration date the date on which a dividend is publicly announced

Building Intuition
Dividend Announcements Send Signals to Investors

A dividend announcement reveals information about management’s view of a company’s prospects. Investors use this information to refine their expectations concerning future cash flows from the company. A change in investor expectations will cause the company’s stock price to change at the time of the public announcement.

The price of a firm’s stock often changes when a dividend is announced. This happens because the public announcement sends a signal to the market about what management thinks the future performance of the firm will be. If the signal differs from what investors expected, they will adjust the prices at which they are willing to buy or sell the company’s stock accordingly. For example, the announcement that a company will significantly increase its dividend can indicate that management is optimistic about future profits—suggesting that future cash flows are higher than expected. This, in turn, can result in an increase in the company’s stock price. In contrast, the decision to cut or eliminate a dividend can send a signal that management is pessimistic and can cause the stock price to go down. We have more to say about how stock prices react to dividend announcements later in this chapter. For now, it is important to remember that a dividend decision sends information to investors and that information is incorporated into stock prices at the time of the public announcement.

The Ex-Dividend Date

An important date included in the public announcement is the ex-dividend date—the first date on which the stock will trade without rights to the dividend. An investor who buys shares before the ex-dividend date will receive the dividend, while an investor who buys the stock on or after the ex-dividend date will not. Before the ex-dividend date, a stock is said to be trading cum dividend, or with dividend. On or after the ex-dividend date, the stock is said to trade ex dividend.

ex-dividend date the first day on which a stock trades without the rights to a dividend

It is important for investors to know the ex-dividend date because it can have significant implications for the taxes and transaction costs they pay. If an investor purchases the company’s shares before the ex-dividend date, the investor knows that he or she will soon receive a dividend on which taxes will have to be paid. (Dividends received by investors are taxed by state and federal governments unless the investor is a tax-exempt organization, such as a university endowment.) In addition, a dividend can create difficulties for a stockholder who wants to have a specific amount of money invested in the firm. By returning value to the stockholder, a firm that pays a dividend may reduce the stockholder’s investment below the level preferred by the stockholder, thereby making it necessary for the stockholder to purchase additional shares and incur the associated brokerage fees and possibly other transaction costs.

As you might suspect, the price of the firm’s shares drops on the ex-dividend date even if there is no new information about the firm. The decline simply reflects the difference in the value of the cash flows that the stockholders are entitled to receive before and after the ex-dividend date. To see how this works, consider a company that recently announced a $1 per share dividend. The company’s stock is currently trading for $10 per share, and the ex-dividend date is tomorrow. In this example, the $10 price includes the value of the dividend because an investor who purchases this company’s stock before the ex-dividend day will receive the dividend. You can think of the $10 as consisting of a $1 dividend plus the value of the stock on the ex-dividend date.4 Since an investor who buys the stock tomorrow will receive only the stock, and not the dividend, the price of the stock will certainly be below $10 tomorrow.

Does it follow that the stock price will drop by $1 tomorrow? No. Research has shown that stock prices drop on the ex-dividend date but that this drop is smaller than the full amount of the dividend. In our example, this means that the drop will be less than $1. Why would the price not drop by the full $1? Because the dividend will be taxed. For the tax year 2020, individuals paid a graduated tax rate on dividend income from U.S. corporations of either 0, 15, or 20 percent depending on their total taxable income and filing status. If you knew that you would have to pay a 15 percent tax on a dividend that you received, would you pay 100 percent of the value of that dividend? We hope not. In this case, a $1 dividend has an after-tax value of only $0.85 if you have to pay a 15 percent tax on it [$1.00 × (1 − 0.15) = $0.85]. If investors pay a 15 percent tax on dividends, the $10 price of the stock in our example should include $0.85 for the dividend and $9.15 ($10.00 − $0.85 = $9.15) for other cash flows, so the stock price should drop to $9.15 on the ex-dividend date.

The Record Date

The record date typically follows the ex-dividend date by one to two business days. The record date is the date on which an investor must be a stockholder of record (that is, officially listed as a stockholder) in order to receive the dividend. The board specifies the record date when it votes to make the dividend payment. Once the company informs the exchange on which its stock is traded what the record date is, the exchange sets the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend day precedes the record date because it takes time to update the stockholder list when someone purchases shares. If you buy the shares before the ex-dividend date, the exchange will ensure that you are listed as a stockholder of record for that company as of the record date.

The Payable Date

The final date in the dividend payment process is the payable date, when the stockholders of record actually receive the dividend. The payable date is typically a couple of weeks after the record date.

An Example of the Dividend Payment Process

We can use Walmart Stores, Inc., to illustrate the dividend payment process. In early 2020, the board of directors of Walmart approved an increase in the company’s regular cash dividend to $2.16 per share per year. As is commonly done, Walmart pays its regular cash dividend quarterly. In other words, after the board vote, its stockholders could expect to receive dividends of $0.54 per share each quarter.5 The dividend increase was announced on February 18, 2020, and so this was the declaration, or announcement, date. Exhibit 17.2 summarizes the full sequence of events for Walmart’s dividend.

It is January 20, 2021, and J&W Corporation’s stock is trading at $23.50 per share. Earlier today, J&W announced that the record date for its next regular cash dividend will be Wednesday, February 17, 2021, and that the dividend payment will be $0.40 per share. The stock exchange has just announced that the ex-dividend date will be Monday, February 15, 2021. If all investors pay taxes of 20 percent on dividends, what do you expect will happen to J&W’s stock price between the time the market closes on Friday, February 12, 2021, and the time it opens on Monday, February 15, 2021?

Walmart’s announcement also specified the other key dates in Exhibit 17.2. The next regular cash dividend would be paid to investors of record as of Friday, March 20, 2020. This was the record date. The ex-dividend date was Thursday, March 19, 2020—one trading day earlier—and the payable date was Monday, April 6, 2020.

The Dividend Payment Process at Private Companies

The dividend payment process is not as well defined for private companies as it is for public companies, because in private companies shares are bought and sold less frequently, there are fewer stockholders, and no stock exchange is involved in the dividend payment process. The board members know the identities of the stockholders when they vote to authorize a dividend—generally, the list of stockholders is relatively short and the largest stockholders are on the board. As a result, it is easy to inform all stockholders of the decision to pay a dividend, and it is easy to actually pay it. There is no public announcement, and there is no need for an ex-dividend date. Consequently, the record date and payable date can be any day on or after the day that the board approves the dividend.

17.2 Stock Repurchases
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what a stock repurchase is and how companies repurchase their stock. Calculate how taxes affect the after-tax proceeds that a stockholder receives from a dividend and from a stock repurchase.
Stock repurchases are another popular method of distributing value to stockholders. With a stock repurchase, a company buys some of its shares from stockholders.

stock repurchase the purchase of stock by a company from its stockholders; an alternative way for the company to distribute value to the stockholders

How Stock Repurchases Differ from Dividends
Stock repurchases differ from dividends in a number of important ways. First, they do not represent a pro-rata distribution of value to the stockholders, because not all stockholders participate. Individual stockholders decide whether they want to participate in a stock repurchase. Some stockholders participate, while others do not. In contrast, in a dividend distribution, all stockholders receive the dividend.

Second, when a company repurchases its own shares, it removes them from circulation. This reduces the number of shares of stock held by investors. Removing a large number of shares from circulation can change the ownership of the firm. It can increase or decrease the fraction of shares owned by the major stockholders and thereby change their ability to control the company. Also, if a company with a relatively small number of shares in the public market distributes a lot of cash to investors through a stock repurchase, there will be less liquidity for the remaining shares. An extreme example of this occurs when a public company repurchases most of its outstanding shares and “goes private.” Since a dividend does not affect who owns the shares or the number of shares outstanding, it does not have these effects on ownership and liquidity.

Third, stock repurchases are taxed differently than dividends. As we saw in the discussion of the ex-dividend date, the total value of dividends is taxable for investors.6 In contrast, when a stockholder sells shares back to the company, the stockholder is taxed only on the profit, or capital gain, from the sale. For example, suppose a stockholder purchased 100 shares for $150 and then sold them to the company for $200 a year later. In this example, the $50 profit ($200 − $150 = $50) that the stockholder earned on the sale would be treated as a capital gain and would be taxed. As with dividend income, individuals pay a graduated tax rate on capital gains of either 0, 15, or 20 percent depending on their total taxable income and filing status. The maximum total tax on the sale of the stock would be $10 ($50 × 0.20 = $10). In contrast, if the company had distributed the $200 as a dividend, the tax for the same investor would have been $40 ($200 × 0.20 = $40)—four times as much! Of course, this difference is even more significant when you remember that stockholders who receive dividends have no choice as to when they must pay the tax because a dividend is not optional. In contrast, since stockholders choose whether to sell their shares in a repurchase plan, they are able to choose when they pay taxes on the profits from selling their stock.

Finally, dividends and stock repurchases are accounted for differently on the balance sheet. For example, when a company pays a cash dividend, the cash account on the assets side of the balance sheet and the retained earnings account on the liabilities and stockholders’ equity side of the balance sheet are reduced. In contrast, when a company uses cash to repurchase stock, the cash account on the assets side of the balance sheet is reduced, while the treasury stock account on the liabilities and stockholders’ equity side of the balance sheet is increased (becomes more negative). The balance sheet in Exhibit 3.1 includes a treasury stock account, indicating that Diaz Manufacturing repurchased 571,320 shares for $23.3 million in 2020.

Stock Repurchases and Taxes

Problem

Your pizza parlor business has been doing very well, and, as a result, you have more cash than you can productively reinvest in the business. You have decided to distribute this cash to yourself, the only stockholder, through a stock repurchase. When you started the business, you invested $300,000 and received 10,000 shares of stock. In other words, each share cost you $30. There are no other shares outstanding, and your business valuation adviser tells you that the stock is worth $800,000 today. If you want to distribute $80,000 through a stock repurchase, how many shares will the company have to repurchase? If you pay taxes of 20 percent on capital gains, how much money will you have left over after paying taxes on the proceeds from the sale of your stock?





How Stock Is Repurchased
Companies repurchase stock in three general ways. First, they can simply purchase shares in the market, much as an individual would. These kinds of purchases are known as open-market repurchases and are a very convenient way of repurchasing shares on an ongoing basis. Open-market repurchases allow firms to determine when and how much of their stock to repurchase, giving managers additional flexibility.

open-market repurchase the repurchase of shares by a company in the open market

When a company has a large amount of cash to distribute, open-market repurchases can be cumbersome because the government limits the number of shares that a company can repurchase on a given day. These limits, which are intended to restrict the ability of firms to influence their stock price through trading activity, mean that it could take months for a company to distribute a large amount of cash using open-market repurchases.

When the management of a company wants to distribute a large amount of cash at one time and does not want to use a special dividend, it can repurchase shares using a tender offer. A tender offer is an open offer by a company to purchase shares.7 There are two types of tender offers: fixed-price and Dutch auction. With a fixed-price tender offer, management announces the price that will be paid for the shares and the maximum number of shares that will be repurchased. Interested stockholders then tender their shares by letting management know how many shares they are willing to sell. If the number of shares tendered exceeds the announced maximum, then the maximum number of shares are repurchased, and each stockholder who tendered shares participates in the repurchase in proportion to the fraction of the total shares that he or she tendered.

tender offer an open offer by a company to purchase shares

With a Dutch auction tender offer, the firm announces the number of shares that it would like to repurchase and asks the stockholders how many shares they would sell at a series of prices, ranging from just above the price at which the shares are currently trading to some higher price. The alternative prices are set higher than the market price to make the offer attractive to stockholders. Stockholders then tell the company how many of their shares they would sell at the various offered prices. Once these offers to sell have been collected, management determines the price that would allow them to repurchase the number of shares that they want. All of the tendering stockholders who indicate a willingness to sell at or below this price will then receive this price for their shares.

The third general way in which shares are repurchased is through direct negotiation with a specific stockholder. These targeted stock repurchases are typically used to buy blocks of shares from large stockholders. Such repurchases can benefit stockholders who are not selling because managers may be able to negotiate a per-share price that is below the current market price. This is possible because the only alternative for a stockholder who owns a large block of shares and wants to sell them at one time often involves offering the shares for a below-market price in the open market. Of course, targeted stock repurchases can also be attractive to managers for other reasons—notably, if the company repurchases the block of shares, there is less chance that the shares will fall into the hands of an unfriendly investor.

targeted stock repurchase a stock repurchase that targets a specific stockholder

Exhibit 17.3 presents statistics for the different types of stock repurchases from a sample of repurchases involving public U.S. firms over the 1984–2001 period. The exhibit indicates that the most common way to repurchase shares is through open-market repurchases (6,470 observations versus 737 for targeted stock repurchases, the second most common method). However, the average percentage of shares repurchased, at 7.37 percent, is considerably smaller for open-market repurchase programs than for the other repurchase methods. This confirms what we stated earlier—managers tend to use methods other than open-market repurchases when they want to distribute a large amount of cash at one time. Finally, Exhibit 17.3 shows that almost half of the targeted stock repurchases involve a purchase price that is below the stock’s price in the open market. This is consistent with the idea that managers can often negotiate discounts when making such purchases. Interestingly, the average stock price reaction to a targeted stock repurchase is negative. The reason for this is not obvious. In some cases, investors may think that managers are repurchasing shares to entrench themselves to the detriment of the stockholders. In other cases, a large stockholder’s willingness to sell his or her shares may signal this investor’s pessimism about the firm’s prospects, thereby causing other market participants to drive down the stock price.

17.3 Dividends and Firm Value
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss the benefits and costs associated with dividend payments, and compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of dividends and stock repurchases.
One reason that we devote so much space in this book to dividends is that they can affect the value of a firm. In this section, we explain why. The best way to begin is by recalling, from Chapter 16, the general conditions under which capital structure policy does not affect firm value:

There are no taxes.
There are no information or transaction costs.
The real investment policy of the firm is fixed.
These are the three conditions identified by Modigliani and Miller (M&M). Since a dividend payment has implications for a firm’s capital structure, as illustrated earlier in the Sealed Air example, the factors that cause dividends to affect firm value are very closely related to the conditions identified by M&M. In fact, if the above conditions hold, then the dividends a firm pays will not affect its value.

Dividends do not matter under these conditions because a stockholder can “manufacture” any dividends he or she wants at no cost, and the total cash flows a firm produces from its real assets are not affected by the dividends that it pays. To see how a stockholder can manufacture dividends, consider a retired stockholder who owns 50,000 shares of a company’s stock and needs to receive a $1 per share dividend each year on this investment to cover his or her living expenses. If the company pays such a dividend, there is no problem. But what if the company does not pay such a dividend? Well, under the above conditions, the stockholder could “manufacture” his or her own dividend by selling $50,000 worth of stock each year. This would reduce the total value of this investor’s stock by $50,000, just as a $50,000 dividend would. Remember that we are assuming that no taxes must be paid, so the decline in the value of the shares would exactly equal the value of the dividend if one were paid.

A stockholder could also undo the dividend decisions made by managers by simply reinvesting the dividends that the company pays in new shares. For instance, if a company paid a $50,000 dividend, thereby reducing the value of a stockholder’s shares, that stockholder could increase his or her ownership in the company’s shares to its previous level by purchasing $50,000 worth of shares. Again, we assume that there are no transactions costs, so the $50,000 purchase is equal to the dividend paid.

Just as with changes in capital structure policy, if investors could replicate the dividends paid by a company on their own at no cost and the managers’ dividend decisions do not affect the total cash flows the firm produces, investors would not care whether or not the company paid a dividend. In other words, they would not be willing to pay more or less for the stock of a firm that pays a dividend than for the stock of a firm that does not pay a dividend.

Benefits and Costs of Dividends
Of course, we know that the M&M assumptions do not apply in the real world. But that is good news in the sense that the imperfect world we live in provides companies with the opportunity to create value through their dividend decisions. Doing so involves balancing benefits and costs, just as we do in choosing a capital structure. We now turn our attention to a discussion of the benefits and costs associated with paying dividends.

Benefits of Dividends

One benefit of paying dividends is that it attracts investors who prefer to invest in stocks that pay dividends. For example, consider the retired stockholder we discussed earlier. While he or she could simply sell some stock each month to cover expenses, in the real world it may be less costly—and it is certainly less trouble—to simply receive regular cash dividend payments instead. Recall that under the M&M conditions, there are no transaction costs. In the real world, though, the retiree will have to pay brokerage commissions each time he or she sells stock. The dividend check, in contrast, simply arrives each quarter. Of course, the retiree will have to consider the impact of taxes on the value of dividends versus the value of proceeds from the sale of stock; but it is quite possible that receiving dividends might, on balance, be more appealing.

Another type of investor that might prefer income-paying stocks is an institutional investor, such as an endowment or a foundation. Because of their investment guidelines, some institutional investors are only allowed to spend proceeds that are received as income from their investments. These institutions face limitations on their ability to sell shares to replicate a dividend.

Unfortunately, the ability to appeal to certain investors is not a very compelling reason for paying dividends. While retirees and some institutional investors might prefer dividends, investors with no current need for income from their investment portfolios might prefer not to receive dividends. Those investors might actually choose to avoid stocks that pay high dividends, since they might have to pay taxes on the dividends and would face transaction costs when they reinvest the dividends they receive.

Furthermore, the fact that some investors prefer to receive dividends does not necessarily mean that an individual company can increase the value of its stock by paying dividends. After all, a wide range of dividend-paying stocks is already available on the market. The addition of one more such stock is unlikely to markedly increase the options available for investors looking for dividends. Therefore, these investors will not be willing to pay a higher price for that stock.

Some people have argued that a large regular dividend indicates that a company is financially strong. This “signal” of strength, they say, can result in a higher stock price. This argument is based on the assumption that a company that is able to pay a large dividend, rather than holding on to cash for future investments, is a company that is doing so well that it has more money than it needs to fund its available investments. The problem with this line of reasoning is that such a company might have more than enough money for all its future investment opportunities because it does not have many future investment opportunities. In this situation, the fact that the company does not need the cash would be a bad signal, not a good one.

Another benefit of paying dividends is suggested by the fact that many companies pay regular cash dividends on the one hand while routinely selling new shares on the other. For example, FPL Group pays a regular dividend and occasionally raises capital by issuing new equity. Why might FPL reduce its equity by paying a dividend and then turn around and increase it by selling new shares? One possible explanation is that management is just trying to appeal to investors who prefer dividends, as we discussed earlier. But another explanation is that this practice helps to align the incentives of managers and stockholders.

Let’s look more closely at this second explanation. Consider a company that is so profitable that it never has to go to the debt or equity markets to raise external capital. This company can pay for all of its needs with earnings from operations. The managers in charge of the company might have incentives to operate the business less efficiently than the stockholders would like. For example, they might invest in negative NPV assets—such as corporate jets, plush offices, or a company apartment in Manhattan—that benefit them but do not create value for the stockholders. These managers might also spend more time than they should away from the office, perhaps serving on the boards of other companies or golfing, letting the operating performance of the company fall below the level that could be achieved if they focused on running the business. Stockholders understand that managers at highly profitable firms have these incentives. Thus, they are likely to reduce the price that they are willing to pay for this company’s stock to reflect the loss of value associated with the managers’ unproductive behaviors.

Now suppose that the company’s board of directors votes to pay dividends that amount to more than the excess cash that the company is producing from its operations. Since the money to pay the dividends will have to come from somewhere, the board is effectively forcing management to sell equity periodically in the public markets. The need to raise equity in the capital markets will help align the incentives of managers with those of stockholders. Why? Because it increases the cost to managers of operating the business inefficiently. In order to raise equity at a reasonable cost, the managers must be careful how efficiently they are operating the business. The process of raising new equity involves a special audit that is more detailed than an annual audit and invites the close attention of lawyers, investment bankers, and outside experts. These outside parties provide a certification function that increases the amount of public information about the firm’s activities. Voluntarily submitting to such outside certification—by paying a dividend and issuing equity rather than just keeping cash inside the firm—can ultimately lead to better company performance and the willingness of investors to pay a higher price for the company’s stock.

One last potential benefit of paying dividends is that dividends can be useful in managing the capital structure of a company. The trade-off theory of capital structure, which we discussed in Chapter 16, tells us that there is an optimal mix of debt and equity that maximizes the value of a firm. To the extent that a company is internally generating more equity than it can profitably invest, the fraction of debt in its capital structure will always be decreasing over time unless the company borrows more money (which it doesn’t need) or distributes cash to stockholders. Paying dividends can help keep the firm’s capital structure near its optimal mix.

Costs of Dividends

In addition to benefits, there are costs associated with dividends. Taxes are among the most important of these costs. As we discussed earlier, dividends are taxable, and the stockholders of firms that pay dividends have no choice but to receive the dividends and pay the associated taxes if they want to own the stock. Tax rates on dividends have varied substantially over time. Before 2003, dividends were taxed as ordinary income by the federal government in the United States. This meant that, depending on the stockholder’s income, as much as 39.6 percent of the dividend would be paid to the federal government in taxes. Tax law changes made in 2003 lowered this top rate to 15 percent, making it the same as the top rate on capital gains. The top rates on both dividends and capital gains were increased to 23.8 percent in 2013, but have since declined to 20 percent. Dividends are also taxed by a number of states, so the total tax rate paid by investors can be higher.

Stockholders can always sell some of their shares to “manufacture” their own dividends, as we discussed earlier. If they do this, they pay taxes only on the profit on the sale. Unless the stockholder received the stock for free, this profit is a smaller amount than the amount the dividend would be. Furthermore, the U.S. tax system has typically treated capital gains differently from dividends. If you own a stock for some specified period of time, currently 12 months, any gain on the sale of that stock is treated as a capital gain. Until 2003, as mentioned, dividends were taxed as ordinary income, and the ordinary income tax rate for most taxpayers was higher than the capital gains tax rate. Thus, before 2003, if you sold shares rather than receiving dividends, you not only paid taxes on a smaller amount, but you also paid a lower rate on the amount that was taxable. Since 2003, the tax rates have been the same for dividends and capital gains. If history is any indication, however, tax rates on dividends may be higher again in the not-too-distant future.

In addition to paying taxes on dividends, owners of stocks that pay dividends often have to pay brokerage fees if they want to reinvest the proceeds. To eliminate this cost, some companies offer dividend reinvestment programs (DRIPs). Through a DRIP, a company sells new shares, commission free, to dividend recipients who elect to automatically reinvest their dividends in the company’s stock. While DRIPs eliminate transaction costs, they do not affect the taxes that must be paid on the dividends. Also, since it is costly to administer a DRIP, these programs effectively transfer the cost from the stockholders who want to reinvest to the firm (which means all stockholders).

dividend reinvestment program (DRIP) a program in which a company sells new shares, commission free, to dividend recipients who elect to automatically reinvest their dividends in the company’s stock

It is worth remembering that the total value of the assets in a company goes down when a dividend is paid. To the extent that a company uses a lot of debt financing, paying dividends can increase the cost of debt. This will happen if the payment of dividends reduces the value of the assets underlying debt holder claims on the cash flows from the firm. With less valuable assets, the debt holders face greater risk of default. To compensate for this greater risk, they will charge the company a higher rate on its debt.

Stock Price Reactions to Dividend Announcements
In the earlier discussion of the dividend payment process, we stated that the price of a company’s stock often changes when a dividend is announced. We also noted that this happens because the public announcement sends a signal to the market about what management thinks the future performance of the firm will be. Let’s consider this issue in more detail.

We can think about the market’s reaction to a dividend announcement in the context of what we call the cash flow identity, a term which means that, during any period, the sources of cash must equal the uses of cash in a firm:

where:

               CFOAt	=	cash flow to investors from operating activity in period t
             Equityt	=	proceeds from the sale of stock in period t
                Debtt	=	proceeds from the sale of debt in period t
                  Divt	=	dividends paid in period t
Repurchasest	=	cash used to repurchase stock in period t
         Interestt	=	interest payments to debt holders in period t
       Principalt	=	principal payments on debt in period t
                  Invt	=	investments in net working capital and fixed assets period t
How can this identity help us to understand how investors use dividend announcements to infer what management thinks the firm’s future performance will be? Let’s consider an example. Assume that a company has just announced an increase in its dividend payments that investors did not expect. If the company is not selling new equity or debt and is not repurchasing stock, and its investment in fixed assets and net working capital does not change, this means that Divt is going up and that Equityt, Debtt, Repurchasest, Interestt, Principalt, and Invt are not changing. Since investors know that the cash flow identity must hold, CFOAt, the cash flow to investors from operating activity, must be expected to increase. This situation can be illustrated as follows:

An expected increase in the cash flow to investors from operating activity is a good signal, and investors will interpret it as suggesting that cash flows to stockholders will increase in the future. As a result, the stock price should go up.

Evidence from studies of stock price reactions to dividend announcements is generally consistent with this theory. This evidence indicates that when a company announces it will begin paying a regular cash dividend, its stock price increases by an average of about 3.5 percent. Similarly, announcements of increases in regular cash dividends are associated with an average stock price increase of 1 to 2 percent. In contrast, the announcement that a company will reduce its regular cash dividend is associated with a 3.5 percent decrease in its stock price, on average. An announcement that a company will pay a special dividend is associated with an average stock price increase of about 2 percent.

It is important to recognize that we cannot interpret these studies as proof that changes in dividends cause changes in stock prices. Rather, the cash flow identity suggests that managers change dividends when something fundamental has changed in the business. It is this fundamental change that causes the stock price to change. The dividend announcement is really just the means by which investors find out about the fundamental change. Although there are benefits and costs associated with dividend payments, the sizes of these benefits and costs tend to be relatively small compared with the changes in value associated with the fundamental changes that take place in firms. By the same token, there is no evidence that it is possible to increase firm value by increasing dividends. Again, dividend changes only provide a signal concerning a fundamental change at the firm. In this sense, they are only by-products of the change.

Dividends versus Stock Repurchases
As we noted earlier, stock repurchases are an alternative to dividends as a way of distributing value. Our discussion has already suggested that stock repurchases have some distinct advantages over dividends. They give stockholders the ability to choose when they receive the distribution, which affects the timing of the taxes they must pay as well as the cost of reinvesting funds that are not immediately needed. In addition, stockholders who sell shares back to a company pay taxes only on the gains they realize, and historically these capital gains have been taxed at a lower rate than dividends.

From management’s perspective, stock repurchases provide greater flexibility in distributing value. We have already discussed how stock prices react to announcements of changes in dividend payments. We can therefore imagine why managers might find stock repurchases relatively more attractive. Even when a company publicly announces an ongoing open-market stock repurchase program, as opposed to a regular cash dividend, investors know that management can always quietly cut back or end the repurchases at any time. In contrast, dividend programs represent a stronger commitment to distribute value in the future because they cannot be quietly ended. For this reason, investors know that managers will initiate regular cash dividends only when they are quite confident that they will be able to continue them for the long run.

Thus, if future cash flows are not certain, managers are likely to prefer to distribute extra cash today by repurchasing shares through open-market purchases because this enables them to preserve some flexibility. If cash flows decline in the future, management can reduce the repurchases without a pronounced effect on the company’s stock price.

Potentially offsetting the advantages of stock repurchases are a few notable disadvantages. One of these disadvantages is the flip side of the signaling benefit discussed in the previous paragraph. Since most ongoing stock repurchase programs are not as visible as dividend programs, they cannot be used as effectively to send a positive signal about the company’s prospects to investors.

A more subtle issue concerns the fact that managers can choose when to repurchase shares in a stock repurchase program. Just like other investors, managers prefer purchasing shares when they believe that the shares are undervalued in the market. The problem is that since managers have better information about the company’s prospects than do other investors, they can take advantage of this information to the detriment of other investors. If managers are taking advantage of superior information, their repurchases are effectively transferring value from stockholders who choose to sell their shares (perhaps because they simply need money to live on) to stockholders who choose to remain invested in the company. A transfer of wealth from one group of stockholders to another is a problem. Remember that management is supposed to act in the best interest of all of the firm’s stockholders.

Companies in the United States have historically distributed more value through dividend payments than through stock repurchases. This suggests that managers have, on balance, found dividends more attractive. However, in recent years the popularity of stock repurchases has increased. From 2005 to 2007, the total dollar value distributed through stock repurchases exceeded the value distributed through dividends for the first time. While the dollar value of stock repurchases has been below that of dividends since 2008, it has remained at historically high levels. At the same time, the way companies pay dividends and how much they pay have changed substantially. Between 1978 and 2000, the number of public industrial companies in the United States that paid dividends declined dramatically, from approximately 2,250 to 926. Interestingly, the companies that stopped paying dividends were primarily those that had paid small dividends. The total value of dividends paid has actually increased since 1978 even after adjusting for inflation. The net result is that the firms that pay dividends are, on average, paying larger dividends.

These trends are illustrated in Exhibit 17.4, which shows the total dollar value of dividends paid and stock repurchased by public U.S. firms over the last four decades, from 1980 to 2019. The exhibit also shows the total value of dividends and of stock repurchases as a percentage of the total market capitalization (total equity value) of public U.S. firms. You can see that the fraction of total equity value that is being distributed to stockholders has declined.

EXHIBIT 17.4 Dividend Payments and Stock Repurchases by U.S. Public Firms, 1980–2019 Both the dollar value of dividends paid by U.S. public firms and the dollar value of stock repurchases increased over the period from 1980 to 2019, as shown in the top figure. However, the increase was more pronounced for stock repurchases. Despite these increases in dollar values, total distributions of value as a percentage of the total market capitalization (total equity value) of U.S. firms actually decreased, as shown in the bottom figure.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 17.1
Choosing a Payout Method

Situation

You are the chief executive officer of San Marcos Pharmaceuticals, a generic drug manufacturing firm. With patents on a lot of brand-name drugs sold by other pharmaceutical firms expiring, San Marcos has been doing very well manufacturing generic copies of those drugs. In fact, business has been going so well that San Marcos is generating more cash flow than is required for investment in the positive NPV projects that are available to the company.

You have decided that you want to distribute the excess (free) cash flow to stockholders rather than accumulate it in the company’s cash accounts. You expect the company to continue to generate free cash flow in the future, but the amount is likely to vary considerably as competitors also start to produce generic drugs. You want to be able to adjust distributions as free cash flows rise and fall but do not want to make San Marcos’s stock price any more volatile than it already is. Furthermore, relatively few of the company’s shares are held by investors that do not pay taxes, such as pension funds and university endowments, so you would prefer that the distributions be as tax efficient as possible.

Your chief financial officer tells you that the most feasible means of distributing the excess cash on an ongoing basis is to pay a regular cash dividend or to repurchase shares through open-market repurchases. Which of these two options should you choose?

17.4 Stock Dividends and Stock Splits
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Define stock dividends and stock splits, and explain how they differ from other types of dividends and from stock repurchases.
Recall that earlier we defined a dividend as something of value distributed to a firm’s stockholders on a pro-rata basis The term dividend is not always used so precisely. In this section, we discuss actions taken by financial managers that are associated with dividends but that do not involve a distribution of value and are, therefore, not really dividends.

Stock Dividends
One type of dividend that does not involve the distribution of value is known as a stock dividend. When a company pays a stock dividend, it distributes new shares of stock on a pro-rata basis to existing stockholders. For example, if a company pays a 10 percent stock dividend, it gives each stockholder a number of new shares equal to 10 percent of the number of shares the stockholder already owns.8 If an investor owns 100 shares, that investor receives 10 additional shares. An investor that owns 500 shares receives 50 additional shares, and so on. Although stock dividends are not as common as regular cash dividends, a number of companies pay stock dividends. For example, Enbridge Energy Management, Tootsie Roll Industries, and United Security Bancshares all paid stock dividends recently.

stock dividend a distribution of new shares to existing stockholders in proportion to the percentage of shares that they own (pro rata); the value of the assets in a company does not change with a stock dividend

To understand why no value is distributed when a stock dividend is paid, consider again a company that pays a 10 percent stock dividend. Assume that the company has total assets with a market value of $11,000, that it has 10,000 shares of stock outstanding, and that it has no debt. Since there is no debt, the stockholders own all of the assets in the firm, and each share is worth $1.10 ($11,000/10,000 shares = $1.10 per share).

When the 10 percent stock dividend is paid, the number of shares outstanding increases by 10 percent, from 10,000 to 11,000. Notice that this is really just an accounting change, since no assets are going out of the company. As a result, the value of the total assets in the company does not change, and the value of each share decreases from $1.10 to $1.00 ($11,000/11,000 shares = $1.00 per share). All that happens when the stock dividend is paid is that the number of shares each stockholder owns increases and their value goes down proportionately. The stockholder is left with exactly the same value as before. In our example, a stockholder who owned 100 shares worth $110 ($1.10 per share × 100 shares = $110) before the stock dividend will own 110 shares worth $110 ($1.00 per share × 110 shares = $110) afterward.

Stock Splits
A stock split is quite similar to a stock dividend, but it involves the distribution of a larger multiple of the outstanding shares.9 As the name suggests, we can think of a stock split as an actual division of each share into more than one share. For example, in a stock split, stockholders frequently receive one additional share for each share they already own. This is known as a two-for-one stock split. Stock splits can also involve larger ratios. For example, there might be a three-for-one stock split in which each stockholder receives two additional shares for each share of stock he or she owns. Besides their size, a key distinction between stock dividends and stock splits is that stock dividends are typically regularly scheduled events, like regular cash dividends, whereas stock splits tend to occur infrequently during the life of a company.

stock split a pro-rata distribution of new shares to existing stockholders that is not associated with any change in the assets held by the firm; stock splits involve larger increases in the number of shares than stock dividends

An example of a stock split is the four-for-one stock split that Apple, Inc., announced on July 30, 2020. In this stock split, each Apple stockholder received three additional shares for each share that he or she owned on August 28, 2020.

As with a stock dividend, nothing substantial changes when a stock split takes place. A stockholder might own twice as many shares after the split, but because the split does not change the nature of the company’s assets, those shares represent the same proportional ownership in the company as the original shares. In this sense, stock splits are like cutting a pizza into more and more slices, which won’t make the pizza any bigger. In the Apple example, the prices per share at the close of trading on Friday, August 28, and Monday, August 31, the next trading day, were $499.24 and $127.58, respectively. This 74.4 percent [($127.58 − $499.24)/$499.24 = −0.744, or −74.4 percent] price decline was almost equal to the 75 percent decline that we would expect from a four-for-one stock split.10 The number of shares went up, while the value of the expected cash flows against which stockholders had claims remained essentially unchanged.

Reasons for Stock Dividends and Splits
At this point, you might be asking why companies pay stock dividends or split their stock. The most often cited reason is known as the trading range argument. This argument proposes that successful companies use stock dividends or stock splits to make their shares more attractive to investors. Why would stock dividends or splits have this effect? Suppose the price of the stock of a successful company was allowed to continue to increase over a long time. Eventually, few investors would be able to afford to purchase a round lot of 100 shares. This, in turn, could affect the company’s stock price.

To understand this argument, you must know that it has historically been more expensive for investors to purchase odd lots, which consist of less than 100 shares, than round lots, which are multiples of 100 shares. Odd lots are less liquid than round lots because more investors want to buy round lots. Because of these disadvantages, investors tend to be less than enthusiastic about purchasing odd lots of less than 100 shares and managers prefer that they do not. According to the trading range argument, when buying a round lot becomes too expensive, investors might avoid buying the stock at all. Stock dividends and splits offer ways to bring the price of the stock down to the appropriate “trading range.”

Although the trading range argument may be appealing to some, researchers have found little support for it. After a stock split, the stock’s dollar trading volume does not appear to be higher than it was before the split. Also, the transaction costs argument no longer carries much weight, as there is now no difference in the costs of purchasing round lots and odd lots. Recently, a number of Fintech startups, including Robinhood and Betterment, have begun to sell fractional shares to individuals. These shares offer investors ownership rights to just a fraction of an individual share of stock, making the per-share market price of stocks much less important.

In the stock market, shares of some companies trade at per-share prices that are far above what is typically thought of as a normal trading range. The most famous of these companies is Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. Its class A shares were trading for $353,194 per share on January 13, 2021, with no apparent negative effects.11

One real benefit of stock splits is that they can send a positive signal to investors about management’s outlook for the future. This, in turn, can lead to a higher stock price. After all, management is unlikely to want to split the stock of a company two-for-one or three-for-one if it expects the stock price to decline. It is only likely to split the stock when it is confident that the stock’s current market price is not too high. A number of research studies have reported evidence indicating that investors tend to interpret stock splits as good news.12

Companies occasionally do reverse stock splits, in which case the number of shares owned by each stockholder is reduced. For example, in a 1-for-10 reverse split, a stockholder receives one share in exchange for each ten shares he or she owned before. If you owned 1,000 shares of the stock of such a company, you would have only 100 (1,000/10 = 100) shares after the reverse stock split.

Reverse stock splits may be undertaken to satisfy exchange requirements. For example, the New York Stock Exchange generally requires listed shares to trade for more than $5, and the NASDAQ requires shares to trade for at least $1. Being removed from the NYSE or NASDAQ can dramatically reduce the liquidity of the company’s stock and harm management’s ability to raise capital in the future. A reverse stock split can help avoid these negative effects by keeping the per-share price above the required thresholds.

17.5 Setting a Dividend Payout
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe factors that managers consider when setting the dividend payouts for their firms.
An important question that you may be asking yourself is exactly how managers set the dividend payouts for their firms. In this section, we discuss the results from two important surveys. These surveys deal with how managers select their dividend payouts and what practical considerations managers must balance when they choose a dividend payout.

What Managers Tell Us
The best known survey of dividend decisions was published in 1956, more than 60 years ago, by John Lintner.13 The survey asked managers at 28 industrial firms how they set their firms’ dividend payouts. The key conclusions from the Lintner study are as follows:

Firms tend to have long-term target payout ratios.
Dividend changes follow shifts in long-term sustainable earnings.
Managers focus more on dividend changes than on the level (dollar amount) of the dividend.
Managers are reluctant to make dividend changes that might have to be reversed.
These results are consistent with the idea that managers tend to use dividends to distribute excess earnings and that they are concerned about unnecessarily surprising investors with bad news.

A more recent study, published in 2005, updates Lintner’s findings.14 The authors conducted a survey of 384 financial executives and personally interviewed 23 other managers. They found that managers continue to be concerned about surprising investors with bad news. Indeed, maintaining level dividend payouts is as important to executives as the investment decisions they make. The authors also found, as Lintner did, that the expected stability of future earnings affects dividend decisions. However, the link between earnings and dividends is weaker today than when Lintner conducted his survey.

In response to the increased use of stock repurchases, the authors of the 2005 study asked managers about their views on repurchases. They found that rather than setting a target level for repurchases, managers tend to repurchase shares using cash that is left over after investment spending. In addition, many managers prefer repurchases because repurchase programs are more flexible than dividend programs and because they can be used to time the market by repurchasing shares when management considers its company’s stock price too low. Finally, the managers who were interviewed appeared to believe that institutional investors do not prefer dividends over repurchases or vice versa. In other words, the choice between these two methods of distributing value has little effect on who owns the company’s stock.

Practical Considerations in Setting a Dividend Payout
In this chapter, we have discussed a wide range of factors that enter into managers’ decisions regarding the selection of their firms’ dividend payouts. While the details are important, it is easy to get caught up in them and to lose sight of the big picture. A company’s dividend payout decision is largely about how the excess value in a company is distributed to its stockholders. Central to choosing this payout is the question of how much value should be distributed. It is extremely important that managers choose their firm’s dividend payouts in a way that enables them to continue to make the investments necessary for the firm to compete in its product markets. With this in mind, managers should consider several practical questions when selecting a dividend payout, including the following:

Over the long term, how much does the company’s level of earnings (cash flows from operations) exceed its investment requirements? How certain is this level?
Does the firm have enough financial reserves to maintain dividend payouts in periods when earnings are down or investment requirements are up?
Does the firm have sufficient financial flexibility to maintain dividends if unforeseen circumstances wipe out its financial reserves when earnings are down?
Can the firm quickly raise equity capital if necessary?
If the company chooses to finance dividends by selling equity, will changes in the number of stockholders have implications for control of the company?

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Explain what a dividend is, and describe the different types of dividends and the dividend payment process. Calculate the expected change in a stock’s price around an ex-dividend date.

A dividend is something of value that is distributed to a firm’s stockholders on a pro-rata basis—that is, in proportion to the percentage of the firm’s shares that they own. There are four types of dividends: (1) regular cash dividends, (2) extra dividends, (3) special dividends, and (4) liquidating dividends. Regular cash dividends are cash dividends that firms pay on a regular basis (typically quarterly). Extra dividends are paid, often at the same time as a regular cash dividend, when a firm wants to distribute additional cash to its stockholders. Special dividends are one-time payments that are used to distribute large amounts of cash. A liquidating dividend is paid when a company goes out of business and is liquidated.

The dividend payment process begins with a vote by the board of directors to pay a dividend. This vote is followed by public announcement of the dividend on the declaration date. On the ex-dividend date, the shares begin trading without the right to receive the dividend. The record date, which follows the ex-dividend date by two days, is the date on which an investor must be a stockholder of record in order to receive the dividend. Finally, the payable date is the date on which the dividend is paid.

Learning by Doing Application 17.1 shows how to calculate the expected change in a stock’s price around the ex-dividend date.

2 Explain what a stock repurchase is and how companies repurchase their stock. Calculate how taxes affect the after-tax proceeds that a stockholder receives from a dividend and from a stock repurchase.

A stock repurchase is a transaction in which a company purchases some of its own shares from stockholders. Like dividends, stock repurchases are used to distribute value to stockholders. The three ways in which stock is repurchased are (1) open-market repurchases, (2) tender offers, and (3) targeted stock repurchases. With open-market repurchases, the company purchases stock on the open market, just like any investor does. A tender offer is an open offer by a company to purchase shares. Finally, targeted stock repurchases are used to purchase shares from specific stockholders.

The calculation of the after-tax proceeds that a stockholder receives is illustrated in the text and in Learning by Doing Application 17.2.

3 Discuss the benefits and costs associated with dividend payments, and compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of dividends and stock repurchases.

The potential benefits from paying dividends include (1) attracting investors who prefer dividends, (2) sending a positive signal to the market concerning the company’s prospects, (3) helping to provide managers with incentives to manage the company more efficiently, and (4) helping to manage the company’s capital structure. One cost of dividends is the fact that a stockholder must take a dividend, and pay taxes on the dividend, whether or not he or she wants the dividend. Stockholders who want to reinvest the dividend in the company must, unless there is a dividend reinvestment program (DRIP), pay brokerage fees to reinvest the money. Finally, paying a dividend can increase a company’s leverage and thereby increase its cost of debt.

With a stock repurchase program, investors can choose whether they want to sell their shares back to the company. Historically, stock repurchases also received more favorable tax treatment. From management’s point of view, stock repurchase programs offer more flexibility than dividends and can have less of an effect on the company’s stock price. One disadvantage of stock repurchases involves an ethical issue: Managers have better information than others about the prospects of their companies, and a stock repurchase can enable them to take advantage of this information in a way that benefits the remaining stockholders at the expense of the selling stockholders.

4 Define stock dividends and stock splits, and explain how they differ from other types of dividends and from stock repurchases.

Stock dividends involve the pro-rata distribution of additional shares in a company to its stockholders. Stock splits are much like stock dividends but involve larger distributions of shares than stock dividends. Stock dividends and stock splits differ from other types of dividends because they do not involve the distribution of value to stockholders. The total value of each stockholder’s shares is largely the same after a stock dividend or stock split as it was before the distribution. Since they do not involve the distribution of value, stock dividends are not really dividends at all.

5 Describe factors that managers consider when setting the dividend payouts for their firms.

A company’s dividend payout decision is largely about how excess value in the company is distributed to its stockholders. Setting the payout depends on several factors: the expected level and certainty of the firm’s future profitability, the firm’s future investment requirements, the firm’s financial reserves and financial flexibility, the firm’s ability to raise capital quickly if necessary, and the control implications of financing dividends by selling equity.

Self-Study Problems
17.1 You would like to own a common stock that has a record date of Friday, September 4, 2020. What is the last date that you can purchase the stock and still receive the dividend?



17.2 You believe that the average investor is subject to a 20 percent tax rate on dividend payments. If a firm is going to pay a $0.30 dividend, by what amount would you expect the stock price to drop on the ex-dividend date?



17.3 Management of the Veil Acts Company just announced that instead of a regular dividend this quarter, the company will repurchase shares using the same amount of cash that would have been paid in the suspended dividend. Should this be a positive or negative signal from the firm?



17.4 Management of the Bernie Rubbel Company has just declared a three-for-one stock split. If you own 12,000 shares before the split, how many shares will you own after the split? What if it were a one-for-three reverse stock split?



17.5 Two publicly traded companies in the same industry are similar in all respects except one. Whereas Publicks has issued debt in the public markets, Privicks has never borrowed from any public source. In fact, Privicks always uses private bank debt for its borrowing. Which firm is likely to have a more aggressive regular dividend payout? Explain.



Discussion Questions
17.1 Suppose that you live in a country where it takes 10 days to settle a stock purchase. By how many days will the ex-dividend date precede the record date?

17.2 The price of a share of stock is $15 on Tuesday, November 16, 2020. The record date for a $0.50 dividend is Friday, November 20, 2020. If there are no taxes on dividends, what would you expect the price of a share to be on each day from November 16 through 20 if no other information relevant to the price of the shares becomes public?

17.3 You find that you are the only investor in a particular stock who is subject to a 15 percent tax rate on dividends (all other investors are subject to a 5 percent tax rate on dividends). Is there greater value to you in holding the stock beyond the ex-dividend date or selling the stock and then repurchasing it on or after the ex-dividend date? Assume that the stock is currently selling for $10.00 per share and the dividend will be $0.25 per share.

17.4 Discuss why the dividend payment process is so much simpler for private companies than for public companies.

17.5 You are the CEO of a firm that appears to be the target of a hostile takeover attempt. Thibeaux Piques has been accumulating the shares of your stock and now holds a substantial percentage of the outstanding shares. You would like to purchase the shares that he owns. List the possible stock repurchase methods that you could use. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?

17.6 You have accumulated stock in a firm that does not pay cash dividends. You have read that, according to Modigliani and Miller, you can create a “homemade” dividend should you require cash. Discuss why this choice may not be very good for the overall value of your position.

17.7 You have just read a press release in which a firm claims that it will be able to generate a higher level of cash flows for its investors going forward. Justify the choice of a dividend payout that could credibly convey that information to the market.

17.8 Some people argue that a high tax rate on dividends creates incentives for managers to go about their business without credibly convincing investors that the firm is doing well, even when it is. Discuss why this may be true.

17.9 Fred Flightstone Mining Co. management does not like to pay cash dividends due to the volatility of the company’s cash flows. Management has found, however, that when the company does not pay dividends, its stock price becomes too high for individual investors. What course of action could management take to get the stock price down without dissipating firm value for stockholders?

17.10 The Lintner study found that firms are reluctant to make dividend changes that might have to be reversed. Discuss the rationale for that behavior.

Today Zebulon management is trying to decide whether to repurchase shares for $70 per share through a fixed-price tender offer or pay a $70 cash dividend per share. If capital gains are taxed at a 15 percent rate, then at what rate must dividends be taxed for you to be indifferent between receiving the dividend and selling your shares back to Zebulon?

17.32 You are the chief financial officer (CFO) of a large publicly traded company. You would like to convey positive information about the firm to the market. If you agree with the conclusions from the Lintner study, will you keep paying your currently high dividend or raise that dividend by a small amount? Explain.

17.33 You are the CFO of a public company that advises distressed companies about how to manage their businesses. Your company has been performing extremely well. In fact, it has earned so much money that the increase in its retained earnings has resulted in a decline in the firm’s debt-to-total-capital ratio from 30 percent to 15 percent. Much of the retained earnings is sitting in a cash account because your firm does not need the money to fund investments. You would like to increase the debt-to-total-capital ratio to 30 percent, which you view as optimal for your firm. How would you recommend doing this if you want to complete the adjustment as soon as possible?

Sample Test Problems
17.1 Shares of Convoy West, Inc., are trading for $55.45 on the day before the ex-dividend date. If the quarterly dividend is $0.16 per share and there are no taxes, how will the share price change on the ex-dividend date?

17.2 Three years ago, you purchased 4,000 shares of Metwa Inc. for $17 per share. Today Metwa is repurchasing its shares through a fixed-price tender offer at a price of $45 per share. What are the after-tax proceeds that you will receive if capital gains are taxed at a rate of 20 percent?

17.3 Why does an ongoing stock repurchase program offer management greater flexibility in distributing value to stockholders than a regular cash dividend?

17.4 Why would management of a company undertake a reverse stock split?

17.5 Tesla, Inc., completed a five-for-one stock split on August 28, 2020. Immediately before the stock split, there were 186.32 million shares outstanding at a price of $2,213 per share. After the split, how many shares were outstanding, and at what price would you expect them to trade? Did the stock split cause any substantial change for Tesla or its investors? Why would Tesla management choose to split the company’s stock?

Notes
1 The investors will actually have less than 10 cents per share to invest if they are required to pay taxes on the dividend. Later in this chapter, we discuss how taxes affect the attractiveness of dividends to investors and the dividend decisions made by firms.

3 This was the increase in the debt-to-total-capital ratio from the day before the initial public announcement of the restructuring to the ex-dividend date. For a detailed discussion of the Sealed Air restructuring, see Karen Hopper Wruck, “Financial Policy, Internal Control, and Performance: Sealed Air Corporation’s Leveraged Special Dividend,” Journal of Financial Economics 36 (1994), 157–192.
4 We do not have to worry about the time value of money in this example since we are assuming that the ex-dividend date is tomorrow.
5 Note that this announcement does not obligate Walmart to continue paying quarterly dividends at that level. In fact, Walmart has increased its dividend payment on a regular basis, but there is no reason that the board could not reduce the quarterly dividend payment at some point in the future.
6 An exception is when the dividend is viewed as a return of the capital that the stockholders have invested in the firm, rather than a distribution of profits. Dividends generally are not a return of capital unless they are very large or when they are liquidating dividends.
7 The term tender offer is commonly used to refer to any open offer to purchase any shares, not just the shares of the firm making the announcement. For example, when a company tries to take over another company, it might begin by announcing a tender offer for that other company’s shares.
8 Fractional shares are generally made up for by a small cash payment.
9 Note that for accounting purposes, a stock split and a stock dividend are treated differently. From a finance point of view, however, they are similar events.
10 If nothing else happened, and the split had none of the effects discussed in the following section, we would expect the Apple stock price to drop by exactly 75 percent. However, changes in market conditions and other circumstances at the firm, as well as possible effects of the split on the attractiveness of Apple’s stock, apparently combined to cause a price decline of slightly less than 75 percent.
11 In 1996, Berkshire Hathaway issued a second class of stock, which was trading at $234.51 on January 13, 2021, but which had no voting rights. Until 2010, when these shares were split 50-to-1, they were trading for as much as $4,500 per share.

Business Formation, Growth, and Valuation
CHAPTER 18
Business Formation, Growth, and Valuation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Explain why the choice of organizational form is important, and describe two financial considerations that are especially important in starting a business.
Describe the key components of a business plan, and explain what a business plan is used for.
Explain the three general approaches to valuation, and value a business using common business valuation approaches.
Explain how valuations can differ between public and private companies and between young and mature companies, and discuss the importance of control and key person considerations in valuation.
In October of 2020, Fintech startup Possible Finance announced that it had received an $11 million round of venture capital financing from Union Square Ventures. Obtaining venture capital for an early-stage startup like Possible Finance was a challenge in 2020 given restrictions on travel and face-to-face meetings due to the COVID 19 outbreak. Forced to make the company’s pitch to investors via video conference, Tony Huang, CEO and co-founder of the company, noted, “It immediately made fundraising much more difficult than anticipated.” With additional funding secured, the management team at Possible could continue to expand the company’s operations.

Founded in 2017, Possible Finance is a high-tech small-loan service, providing individuals with cash advances of up to $500. Similar to payday lenders, Possible’s business model focuses on short-term loans; however, borrowers are able to arrange for repayment of the loans in installments, and the repayment of the debt is reported to credit agencies, helping some individuals rebuild tarnished credit scores. The technology behind the business model of Possible Finance provides some advantages over a more traditional assessment of the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers. The company links to customers’ bank accounts and uses machine learning to analyze financial transaction data to make credit risk decisions, rather than relying solely on FICO credit scores.

Raising venture capital financing required a great deal of careful management by Possible Finance’s founders and management team, not only of the business, but also in their approach to fundraising. They had to prove the viability of their artificial intelligence (AI) driven business model in a highly technical and very competitive market for Fintech investment. The founders of the company had to put together a compelling story that would convince investors that their product would stand out in a crowded marketplace. They also had to prove that they could overcome various obstacles, including acquiring new customers, enhancing their models for consumer credit risk, and building the company with a fully remote workforce. Most importantly, the Possible team had to persuade investors that key company managers would be able to execute the business plan and earn them attractive returns.

This chapter discusses some financial aspects of forming, growing, and financing a new business. It also discusses, in detail, the methods used to value both small and large businesses. Business valuation concepts were certainly on the minds of Possible Finance founders when they were raising capital, as they had to decide exactly how much of the company’s equity they would have to sell to obtain the funds they needed to grow the business. These concepts are important for managers of every growing company, because they make business decisions that create value for the company’s investors.

Chapter Preview
In earlier chapters, we discussed how businesses are organized and how financial managers make long-term investment decisions, manage working capital, and finance the investments and activities of their businesses. In this chapter, we reexamine these concepts in the context of business formation, growth, and valuation. The chapter provides an integrated perspective on how the decisions that financial managers make affect firm value.

We begin by considering the decision by an entrepreneur to start a business and the choice of how the business should be organized. The organizational form of a business affects many important financial decisions through its impact on the availability and cost of capital, the control of the business, the ability to attract and retain high-quality managers, the taxes that must be paid, and the agency problems that might arise in the business, among other factors. We then discuss financial considerations that are important to managers of young, rapidly growing firms.

Next we focus on the role that a carefully prepared business plan plays in raising capital for a young, rapidly growing business and in providing a road map of where the business is going for use in managerial decision making. The importance of a business plan cannot be understated. The act of preparing a business plan forces an entrepreneur to think carefully about the aspects of the business that are crucial to its success. This helps him or her to better communicate what the prospects for the business are and to manage the business more effectively.

The last two sections of the chapter address business valuation concepts. These sections provide a broad overview of the business valuation approaches used by financial managers and describe how differences in the characteristics of companies affect valuation analyses. The impact of control considerations and key people on business valuations are also discussed.

18.1 Starting a Business
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain why the choice of organizational form is important, and describe two financial considerations that are especially important in starting a business.
People start their own businesses for a wide variety of reasons. Some have an idea for a new product or service that they think will revolutionize an industry and make them rich. Others live in an area where there are no attractive employment opportunities for them, and starting a business is the only way to earn a living. Others simply want to be their own boss.

Regardless of their motives, all of these people face the decision of whether to start their own business or purchase an already established business. Starting your own business can provide greater potential rewards but is inherently more risky than buying and growing a business that someone else has already built. The founder of a company must start from scratch by choosing the products to sell, the markets to sell them in, and the best strategy for selling them. He or she must then raise the money necessary to develop the products, acquire the necessary assets, and hire the right people. Of course, as the business is being built, the founder must also manage day-to-day operations to ensure that his or her overall plan is being implemented as well as possible.

In this section, we discuss factors that entrepreneurs consider when deciding to launch a new business, factors that affect the form of organization that they choose, and financial considerations associated with starting a business.

Making the Decision to Proceed
Hundreds of thousands of new businesses are started in the United States each year, but many do not succeed. The U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 804,398 new firms were formed between March 2019 and March 2020. However, statistical analyses of earlier business formations suggest that only about 50 percent of these firms will still be in business in 2025 (see www.bls.gov/bdm/bdmage.htm#Total). Among those that do survive, only a few will provide high returns to their founders and early investors.

Businesses fail for many reasons. Some fail because consumers do not accept their products. Others fail because the founder pursues a poorly thought-out strategy or does not have the management skills to properly execute a good strategy. Another common reason for new business failures is that founders underestimate how much money it will take to get their businesses up and running. For example, they underestimate the amount of money that will be needed to cover cash outflows until cash inflows from sales are large enough to do so. These founders fail to ensure that they have enough money to give the business a fighting chance.

The fact that many new businesses fail does not mean that you should not start a business if you believe that you have a good idea. It just means that you should carefully think through your new business idea before you make the decision to proceed. Not thinking carefully about your idea can lead you to pursue a poor strategy, fail to realize that you might need help in executing your strategy, or underestimate how much money you will need.

It is beyond the scope of this book to tell you how to properly evaluate a business idea, a strategy for pursuing it, or your management abilities. Fortunately, a lot has been written on these topics by others. For example, you can find useful readings on these topics on the U.S. Small Business Administration Web site (see the earlier margin reference).

The only advice that we can give you in these areas is to be careful and realistic in assessing your opportunities. Don’t jump into a business without careful thought, but also don’t overanalyze opportunities to the point where you are just convincing yourself not to proceed. Taking calculated risks is part of business. Also, don’t think that failure will ruin your chances of ultimately achieving business success. Many successful entrepreneurs and executives have failed more than once in their careers. Successful people learn from both their failures and their successes.

Choosing the Right Organizational Form
Once you have made the decision to start a business, you must decide what form of organization will work best. Chapter 1 discussed some of the more common basic forms of business organization—sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations—and some of their advantages and disadvantages. In that discussion, you saw that there are variations in the basic forms of business organization. For example, Chapter 1 describes general, limited, and limited liability partnerships. There are also a number of different types of corporations, as well as hybrids between partnerships and corporations. The reason that so many different forms of organization exist is that the needs of businesses vary considerably. The wide range of choices has made the decision of how to organize a business so complex that many people don’t even try to make this decision without the advice of an attorney. In this section, we extend the discussion begun in Chapter 1 by focusing, from a financial perspective, on factors that affect the choice of the appropriate organizational form for a new business.

As you can see in Exhibit 18.1, which is the same as Exhibit 1.3, a sole proprietorship is the least expensive type of business to start. To start a sole proprietorship, all you have to do is obtain the business licenses required by your local and state governments. Partnerships are more costly to form because the partners must hire an attorney to draw up and maintain the partnership agreement, which specifies the nature of the relationships between the partners. Forming a corporation also requires hiring an attorney to draft a document that spells out things such as how many shares can be issued, what voting rights the stockholders will have, and who the board members are. Over the life of a successful business, these out-of-pocket costs are not very important. However, to a cash-strapped entrepreneur, they can seem substantial.

EXHIBIT 18.1 Characteristics of Different Forms of Business Organization

Choosing the appropriate form of business organization is an important step in starting a business. This exhibit compares key characteristics of the most popular forms of business organization in the United States.

 	Sole Proprietorship	Partnership		Corporation	Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or Company (LLC)
General	Limited		S-Corp.	C-Corp.

Because the life of a sole proprietorship is limited to the life of the proprietor, it ceases to exist when the proprietor gets out of the business. In contrast, the lives of all other forms of organization can be made independent of the life of the founder. Partnership agreements, including the corresponding agreement in an LLC, can be amended to allow for the business to continue when the founders leave. Corporations, which are legal persons under state law, automatically have an indefinite life. You will notice that Exhibit 18.1 indicates that the lives of partnerships and LLCs are flexible. This is because, while partnership and LLC agreements can be written so that their lives are indefinite, they can also be written with a fixed life in mind. For example, private equity and venture capital limited partnerships and LLCs are typically structured so that they last only 10 years.

The ability to make the life of a business independent of that of the founder increases the liquidity of the ownership interests, making it easier for the business to raise capital and for investors to sell their interests at an attractive price. Since a sole proprietorship has no ownership interest that can be sold directly, the proprietor can sell only the assets of the business. There is no way to sell a partial ownership interest.

Even with partnerships and corporations, it can be quite expensive to raise capital for the business or for an investor to sell an ownership interest. Common restrictions in partnership and LLC agreements and the need to amend the partnership and LLC documents to reflect a change in ownership can make transferring ownership time consuming and costly. Selling shares in a corporation can be costly if that corporation is not publicly traded.

Making sure that a new business has access to enough capital is always an important concern for an entrepreneur. By their nature, sole proprietorships must rely on equity contributions from the proprietor and debt or lease financing. In contrast, partnerships can turn to all of the partners for additional capital, and corporations can sell shares to both insiders and outsiders. Limited partnerships and LLCs are less constrained than general partnerships because they can raise money from limited partners or from “members,” as outside investors in LLCs are called, who are not directly involved in running the business. C-corporations can have a virtually unlimited number of potential stockholders.

The downside of being able to raise equity capital from other people is the need to share control. An entrepreneur who chooses a form of organization other than a sole proprietorship, and who does not retain 100 percent ownership, must give up some control. Of course, the entrepreneur may have little choice in this trade-off if the business requires more equity capital than he or she can personally provide.

It is important to recognize that investors, such as angel investors and venture capitalists, who are especially important sources of capital for young, rapidly growing firms, tend to prefer to invest only in C-corporations. Since venture capitalists do not typically want to become full operating partners in the businesses in which they invest and because the cost of transferring ownership interests can be much lower for C-corporations, they will generally invest only in businesses that are organized this way.

Chapter 1 discussed the concept of separation of ownership and control and how it is related to agency problems. This separation has benefits as well as costs. While it is true that agency problems can arise when owners delegate decision-making authority to professional managers, these costs may be smaller than the benefits. Specifically, the ability to separate ownership from management control enables a firm to raise capital from investors who have no interest in being directly involved in the business. This can greatly increase the number of potential investors. Another benefit is that an entrepreneur can turn over day-to-day control of a business to a more capable manager, become less involved in the business, and yet continue to benefit from its successes as an investor.

Another key concern of all entrepreneurs is being able to attract and retain high-quality employees. Being able to offer a current or potential employee an ownership interest in the business can help greatly in retention and recruiting. The inability to offer ownership interests is a major disadvantage of sole proprietorships.

Financial liabilities associated with a business are also an important consideration when choosing the form for a business. On this dimension, sole proprietorships, general partnerships, and limited partnerships are at a disadvantage. Sole proprietors and general partners face the possibility that their personal assets can be taken from them to satisfy claims on their businesses. In contrast, the liabilities of investors in corporations (both S-corporations and C-corporations) and LLPs and LLCs are limited to the money that they have invested in the business.

The choice of organizational form also affects how the business’s operating profits will be taxed. More taxes mean that the owners get less. In each of the organizational forms in Exhibit 18.1, with the exception of C-corporations, all profits normally flow through to the owners in proportion to their ownership interests.1 These owners pay taxes on the business profits when they file their personal tax returns. Profits earned in C-corporations are taxed at the corporate tax rate, and the after-tax profits are taxed a second time when they are distributed to stockholders in the form of dividends. On the bright side, because profits are taxed in the corporation, certain benefits, such as health insurance, that are paid to stockholders who work in a C-corporation are tax deductible. These benefits are not generally deductible with the other forms of organization.

Financial Considerations
The most important financial concern of any entrepreneur is making sure that the business has access to enough money to be successful. Unlike a successful mature company, which can rely on cash flows from sales of other products to fund new product introductions, an entrepreneur must obtain funding from outside the firm. This makes it especially important for the entrepreneur to understand the cash requirements of the business.

The margin for error is small. If the entrepreneur miscalculates how much money is necessary, it may be too late to raise more money by the time this error is recognized. Raising external capital can be a time-consuming process and becomes increasingly difficult as a firm becomes more and more cash constrained. Outside investors are especially careful about investing in businesses that have run short of cash. The fact that the business has gotten into such a position can suggest that the business idea may not be viable or that the entrepreneur may not be the right person to build it, or both.

Two tools are particularly useful in understanding the cash requirements of a business and in estimating how much financing a new business will require: (1) the cash flow break-even analysis discussed in Chapter 12 and (2) the cash budget.

Cash Flow Break-Even

Recall that pretax operating cash flow (EBITDA) break-even analysis is used to compute the level of unit sales that is necessary to break even on operations from a pretax operating cash flow perspective. It is calculated using Equation 12.4:

where FC is the fixed costs associated with the business and Price − Unit VC is the per-unit contribution.

It is important for an entrepreneur to understand the concept of EBITDA break-even and how to calculate this point for each product a business produces. This calculation focuses the entrepreneur’s attention on the importance of maximizing a product’s per-unit contribution and minimizing overhead costs. It also provides a means of estimating how long it will take for a product to reach the break-even point and, therefore, how much money will be needed to launch a new product or business.

Although it might seem obvious that an entrepreneur should want to maximize the per-unit contribution of each product and minimize total fixed costs, entrepreneurs often lose sight of these objectives. An entrepreneur can get so caught up in developing the best possible product that he or she does not adequately consider how much customers are willing to pay for that product. For example, adding another feature to a word-processing program can be expensive, and consumers might not be willing to pay the additional cost if they are unlikely to use that feature. Of course, being too sensitive to the possibility of overinvesting in new product development can harm a business by causing it to lose its competitive advantage. An entrepreneur should always be looking for ways to maximize the per-unit contribution of the firm’s products while maintaining the firm’s competitive position.

Many entrepreneurs also lose sight of the importance of controlling fixed costs. For example, several firms with virtually no sales have spent millions of dollars for a single short advertisement during Super Bowl games. Many such firms also spend a great deal of money on extravagant fringe benefits or things like team-building activities in which they take their entire product development staffs on week-long trips to vacation resorts. Although expenses such as these might help to increase employee productivity or encourage more creativity and hard work among the development staff, they also increase the number of units that a business must sell to break even. Unfortunately, some companies run out of money before they ever break even.

Cash Inflows and Outflows

The cash budget is also a very useful planning tool for entrepreneurs. It summarizes the cash flows into and out of a firm over a period of time. Cash budgets often present the inflows and outflows on a monthly basis but can be prepared for any period, including daily or weekly. Preparing a cash budget helps an entrepreneur better understand where money is coming from, where it is going, how much external financing is likely to be needed, and when the need is likely to arise. Understanding where the money is coming from and where it is going helps an entrepreneur maintain control of the company’s finances. Knowing how much external financing is likely to be needed and when helps the entrepreneur plan fundraising efforts before it is too late.

To better understand how a cash budget can help an entrepreneur, let’s consider an example. Suppose that it is March 1, 2022, and that you are planning to open a new restaurant called the Pizza Palace. You have saved $25,000, which you intend to invest in the business, and you have obtained a five-year loan for $50,000 at an APR of 8 percent (8 percent/12 months per year = 0.667 percent per month). The loan principal will be repaid in five equal installments of $10,000 at the end of each of the next five years. Exhibit 18.2 presents a monthly cash budget for your restaurant investment.

EXHIBIT 18.2 Pizza Palace Monthly Cash Budget for the Period March 2022 through February 2023a

A monthly cash budget summarizes the cash that management expects to flow into and out of a business each month. At a minimum, it presents the cash inflows and outflows for each of the next 12 months and for the entire 12-month period. Monthly cash budgets can extend beyond 12 months.

a Some totals do not appear to add up precisely because the actual values computed in the model are rounded to the nearest whole number for presentation in this exhibit.
The initial cash balance in row 1 of the March column of your budget equals the $75,000 that you have raised to finance the project. You estimate that it will take two weeks to actually open the restaurant and, knowing that you will have to build a customer base from scratch, you expect to have only $3,000 in sales during the first month. You do not anticipate providing any credit to your customers, so all of the proceeds from the sales will be received in cash. As shown in rows 8 through 25 of Exhibit 18.2, you expect cash operating expenses to total $20,770 and interest expense, capital expenditures, and start-up costs to be $333, $50,000, and $800, respectively, during March. With only $3,000 in cash inflows, these expenditures will reduce the cash balance by the end of March to only:

While the restaurant is expected to have a positive cash balance at the end of March, the cash balance will be negative by the end of April if no additional financing is obtained. You can see this by noting that the beginning cash balance of $6,097 plus the cash sales of $12,000 would provide a total of only $18,097 with which to pay $22,220 in operating expenses and $333 of interest. This would result in an ending cash balance of:2

Since a restaurant cannot operate without at least some cash for the cash register, you will have to invest more than $4,457 in the business during the month of April. For example, if you decide that you want to maintain a cash balance of at least $5,000, you will have to invest an additional $4,457 + $5,000 = $9,457. This investment is shown in row 5 of the April column in Exhibit 18.2. In this example, the investment is treated as an equity investment by the owner rather than as additional debt. You can tell this by the fact that there is no change in the interest payments in row 20. However, we could easily have treated this amount as a loan instead.

Notice that the cash budget tells you that if the cash forecasts in your budget are correct, you will have to raise, and invest, a total of:

by the end of August to ensure that your restaurant’s cash balance does not fall below $5,000. Knowing this at the beginning of March will be very helpful in planning your fundraising activities for the year.

You might also note that the cash budget indicates that $1,020 will have to be invested in February 2023. This is because the first principal payment on the debt is due at the end of that month, and the investment is needed to maintain a minimum cash balance of $5,000. If you plan to maintain total debt of $50,000 in this business, you could also cover this requirement by obtaining a new $10,000 loan, which you would use to make the debt principal payment.

We can also calculate the pretax operating cash flow break-even point for the Pizza Palace restaurant. If, for simplicity, we assume that the average customer spends $10 for pizza and a drink and that the only unit variable costs are those associated with the food, then we can calculate that the unit contribution will be $6 per customer when the business is up and running in September 2022. We know that the unit contribution is $6 because food purchases represent $14,000/$35,000 = 0.40, or 40 percent of cash sales. This leaves 60 percent of cash sales, or $6 per customer, to cover fixed costs. Knowing the unit contribution and assuming all costs other than those associated with food purchases are fixed, we can calculate the pretax operating cash flow break-even point as follows:

In other words, your restaurant will have to serve at least 3,195 customers per month (approximately 107 per day) in order to break even on a cash flow basis once it is up and running.

We have simplified our example by assuming that the restaurant does not provide credit to customers or hold any material inventories of food, supplies, and so forth. However, we could have incorporated these characteristics into our cash budget using the working capital management concepts discussed in Chapter 14.

18.2 The Role of the Business Plan
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the key components of a business plan, and explain what a business plan is used for.
In our discussion of the cash budget, we assumed that any cash required by the business would come from the owner or from a loan. Unfortunately, financing a business is not always so simple. An important tool in financing and managing a young, rapidly growing business is the business plan.

Why Business Plans Are Important
Recall from Chapter 15 that the equity capital used by entrepreneurs includes their own money, money from friends and family, investments by venture capitalists, equity raised by selling shares in the stock market, and so on. Debt financing can also come from a wide variety of sources, including the entrepreneur, a bank, a local individual investor, another business, and the sale of debt in the public debt markets, among others.

Ensuring that a young, rapidly growing business has enough cash is a simple matter if the money comes from the entrepreneur. The entrepreneur only has to decide to make the investment. Things are more complicated when the money comes from elsewhere. The entrepreneur must convince potential investors that purchasing debt or equity in the firm will yield attractive returns. In other words, they must be persuaded that they will be adequately compensated for the risks they bear.

Convincing outsiders to invest in a company can be difficult enough if the business has a well-established track record. Raising money from outsiders can be immensely difficult for a young company. The entrepreneur often begins the process with little more than an idea of where the business is headed and some limited operating results in the form of unaudited and often incomplete financial statements. To overcome the skepticism of outside investors, many entrepreneurs prepare a business plan.

A business plan is like a road map for a business. It presents the results from a strategic planning process that focuses on how the business will be developed over time. It describes where the company is going and what steps the company will follow to get there. A well-prepared business plan makes it easier for an entrepreneur to communicate to potential investors precisely what he or she expects the business to look like in the future, how he or she expects to get it to that point, and what returns an investor might expect to receive. The fact that an entrepreneur has prepared such a document also demonstrates to investors that the entrepreneur has carefully thought through the business idea. This is especially important when the business is in a very early stage of development and the entrepreneur must convince investors that he or she is capable of building it.

business plan a document that describes the details of how a business will be developed over time

In addition to its usefulness in raising capital, a business plan can help an entrepreneur set the goals and objectives for the company, serve as a benchmark for evaluating and controlling the company’s performance, and communicate the entrepreneur’s ideas to managers, outside directors, customers, suppliers, and others. A thoroughly thought-out plan can help a business owner avoid problems and better deal with those that arise. In short, business planning is extremely important to the survival of a small and growing company.

The Key Elements of a Business Plan
The depth and scope of business plans vary widely, but most well-developed business plans include the following:

An executive summary, which summarizes the key points made in the plan.
A company overview, which describes what the company does and what its competitive advantages are.
A detailed description of the products and services the company sells or plans to sell, their current state of development or market penetration, competitive advantages, product life cycle, and any patents or legal protections that might provide a competitive advantage.
A market analysis, which discusses the markets for the firm’s products and highlights the important characteristics of these markets as they relate to the company.
A discussion of the marketing and sales activities that will enable the company to achieve the sales and profits reflected in the financial forecasts.
A discussion of the operations of the business—how the product is (or will be) produced and distributed, who the suppliers are, and any competitive advantages the business has in this area.
A discussion of the management team, which includes the company’s organizational structure and describes the talents and skills of the managers. The discussion of the managers should explain why they are qualified to manage and grow this particular business. This is an especially important part of the business plan when it comes to raising capital. Investors in young businesses invest in the key people as much as in the business idea itself.
A description of the ownership structure, including the types of securities the firm has issued and who owns them. Potential investors use this information when they value the securities they are considering purchasing and to help them understand the incentives that managers and other owners have to make the business a success.
A discussion of capital requirements and uses. This section covers the current capital requirements of the business as well as capital requirements over the next five years and provides a detailed account of how the money will be used.
Historical financial results, when they are available, along with financial forecasts. If sufficient historical results are available, this section will also include an analysis of those results using the financial statement analysis tools discussed in Chapter 4. The forecasts include a month-by-month cash budget for the next two or three years as well as yearly forecasts of operating results. The cash budget helps the reader understand what the cash inflows and outflows will be and their timing. The yearly results provide an indication of what types of returns might be expected from the business.

18.3 Valuing a Business
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain the three general approaches to valuation, and value a business using common business valuation approaches.
Successful decision makers in both small and large firms must understand what determines the value of a business. It is not possible to consistently make investment and operating decisions that create value without knowing how to identify positive NPV projects or how operating decisions affect the value of a firm. This knowledge is also crucial when making financing decisions. In Chapters 16 and 17, we also saw how a firm’s value is affected by capital structure and payout policies. Decision makers must understand business valuation concepts in order to be able to identify the optimal capital structure and payout policy.

In this section, we discuss fundamental business valuation concepts. You will see that financial analysts apply many of the concepts that have already been discussed in this book when they value a business. The reason is that a business is really just a bundle of related projects, and the value of the business equals the total value of this bundle. In other words, the value of a business is determined by the magnitude of the cash flows that it is expected to produce, the timing of those cash flows, and the likelihood that the cash flows will be realized.

Fundamental Business Valuation Principles
Before we discuss the specific ways in which businesses are valued, you should be aware of two important valuation principles.

The First Valuation Principle: The first valuation principle is that the value of a business changes over time. Changes in general economic and industry conditions, and decisions made by managers, all affect the value of the cash flows that a business is expected to generate in the future. For example, changes in interest rates affect the firm’s cost of capital and, therefore, the present value of future cash flows. A change in interest rates can also affect the demand for a firm’s products if customers typically finance the purchases of those products with loans, as they often do for big-ticket items such as automobiles and houses. Similarly, competitors enter and exit industries, introduce new products, change prices, and so forth. These actions also affect the value of a business by altering its cash flows or risk. Finally, the value of a business is affected by managers’ investment, operating, and financing decisions.

Because the value of a business changes over time, it is important to specify a valuation date when valuing a business. Normally, this date is the date on which you do the analysis, but it can be an earlier date in some situations. For example, when companies are sued or when stockholders are involved in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service, the value of the business or its stock as of some date in the past must often be estimated. A stockholder may claim that managers sold stock for less than it was worth at some time in the past, or the IRS may claim that the value of shares passed to an heir was greater than claimed when the taxes were filed by the estate of the deceased stockholder. By specifying the valuation date, the person who values a business makes it clear to anyone who uses the value estimate precisely what economic, industry, and firm conditions are reflected in that estimate.

valuation date the date on which a value estimate applies

Building Intuition
The Value of a Business Is Specific to a Point in Time

The value of a business is affected by general economic and industry conditions as well as the decisions made by managers. All of these factors affect the cash flows that a business is expected to produce in the future and the rate at which those cash flows should be discounted. Since all of these factors change over time, so will the value of the business.

The Second Valuation Principle: A second very important valuation principle is that there is no such thing as the value of a business. The value of a business can be different to different investors. To understand why, consider two different investors who are interested in purchasing a business that is for sale. Suppose that one investor is a competitor of the business that is for sale and the other is an individual who just wants to invest some money and plans to let the same management continue to operate the business independently. The competitor, who is what we call a strategic investor, might be willing to pay a higher price for the business than the other investor, who is what we call a financial investor, because the strategic investor might be able to combine the business with his or her current business in a way that reduces costs or increases revenues. The financial investor does not have the potential to benefit from these synergies.

Building Intuition
The Value of a Business Is Not the Same to All Investors

The value of a business is not the same to all investors because different investors will obtain different cash flows from owning a business. For example, the cash flows to passive investors will differ from the cash flows to investors who are active in the management of the business. Cash flows will also differ among active investors because they will have different skill levels, operating preferences, and abilities to benefit from synergies.

The key implication of the idea that the value of a business can differ among investors is that the purpose of a valuation affects the way we do the analysis. If a valuation is being performed to determine what price a particular investor would be willing to pay for a business, the analysis must consider how that investor will operate the business. In the business valuation terminology, we would refer to this as an estimate of the investment value of the business to that investor.

investment value the value of a business to a specific investor

If, instead of estimating the value of a business to a particular investor, an analyst is trying to estimate the price that a typical investor would pay for a business, he or she would be estimating the fair market value of the business. The fair market value of a business is the value of that business to a hypothetical person who is knowledgeable about the business. It does not include the value of synergies or the effects of any investor-specific management style. For this reason, the fair market value can differ considerably from the investment value of a business.

fair market value the value of a business to a typical investor

Business Valuation Approaches
There are many business valuation methods, but most can be classified into one of three general categories: (1) cost approaches, (2) market approaches, and (3) income approaches. Cost, market, and income valuation approaches can be used to value a wide range of assets. They do not apply only to business valuation.

For example, the house or apartment building you live in has at some point been valued using a cost, market, or income approach—possibly even all three. When the building was insured, the insurance company probably used a cost approach to estimate its replacement cost. The appraiser for the local taxing authority is likely to have used a market approach, in which the estimated value was based on recent prices paid for similar properties in the local real estate market. Finally, if your house or apartment building was ever evaluated as a potential rental property by an investor, the investor probably used an income approach. In this analysis, the investor estimated the present value of the cash flows that the property would produce if it were rented.

While the ways in which the cost, market, and income approaches are used to value a business differ from the ways in which they are used to value real estate, the basic principles are the same. We next describe how these approaches are used to value businesses.

Cost Approaches

Two cost approaches that are commonly used to value businesses or their individual assets are the replacement cost and adjusted book value approaches.

Replacement Cost
The replacement cost of a business is the cost of duplicating the business’s assets in their present form as of the valuation date. It thus reflects both the nature and condition of the assets. For example, the replacement cost of a 15-year-old electric wood saw that is in relatively good condition equals what it would cost to purchase an identical used saw in the same condition.

replacement cost the cost of duplicating the assets of a business in their present form as of the valuation date

The replacement cost valuation approach is generally used to value individual assets within a business when they are being insured, but it is rarely used to value an entire business. Since investors are concerned with the value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future, they use valuation approaches that reflect the value of these expected cash flows when deciding how much to pay for firms.

Although the replacement cost approach tends to be more useful for insurance purposes, it can be helpful in conducting a buy-versus-build analysis when managers are thinking about making a business acquisition. Before purchasing a business, it usually makes sense to ask if you could build the same business in a way that would result in a greater NPV—in other words, whether it is cheaper to build the business yourself or to buy one that already exists. Answering this question can serve as a useful common-sense check on whether you might be paying too much for the business.

When using the replacement cost approach in a buy-versus-build analysis, you must be sure to include the cost of all tangible assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and all intangible assets, such as brand names and customer lists. You must also include the cost of hiring the people necessary to run the business and account for the cash flows that you would not receive during the time that it would take to build the business. It can take a long time to build a business, and until the business is up and running it will produce smaller cash flows than a business you might acquire.

Adjusted Book Value
The adjusted book value approach involves estimating the market values of the individual assets in a business and adding them up. When this approach is used, the fair market value of each asset is estimated separately and the values are summed to arrive at the total value of the business. As with the replacement cost approach, an adjusted book value analysis should include all tangible and intangible assets, whether they are actually included on the accounting balance sheet or not.

adjusted book value the sum of the fair market values of the individual assets in a business

The adjusted book value approach is useful in valuing holding companies whose main assets are publicly traded or other investment securities, but it is generally less applicable to operating businesses. The value of an operating business is usually greater than the sum of the values of its individual assets because the present value of the cash flows expected from the company is greater. The difference between the value of the expected cash flows and that of the assets is referred to as going-concern value.

going-concern value the difference between the value of a business as a going concern (the present value of the expected cash flows) and the adjusted book value

Going-concern value reflects the value associated with additional cash flows the business is expected to produce because of the way in which the individual assets are managed together. A lot of different factors determine the going-concern value of a business. For example, one business can have a larger going-concern value than another business because it has a stronger management team that is able to invest in and utilize the business’s assets more efficiently. The going-concern value might also be larger because the employees of the company are more skilled or work better together or because the government provides some special benefit to a particular business.

To see how going-concern value might be created, suppose that you just obtained the exclusive right to produce and sell a patented type of specialty brick in the United States that has been very popular among homebuilders in Canada. Also suppose that you expect to be able to satisfy demand for this brick with a single manufacturing plant. No matter where you build this plant, its adjusted book value will be the same, assuming that the assets in the plant, such as kilns, forklifts, conveyer belts, and so forth, are commonly available and used all over the country. However, the actual value of the plant (business) will depend in part on where you decide to build it if transportation costs are an important component of the overall costs (bricks are heavy and cost a lot to transport). If you build the plant in Oklahoma (the middle of the country), it will be worth more than if you build it in one corner of the country, such as in Miami, because average transportation costs to builders around the country will be lower from Oklahoma. As a result, the going-concern value will be greater if you build it in Oklahoma.

Although the adjusted book value approach does not capture the going-concern value associated with a business, it is useful under certain circumstances. We might use this approach (1) when it is especially difficult to forecast a business’s likely cash flows; (2) when we suspect that the going-concern value of the business is negative—in other words, the owners of the business would be better off if the business were simply shut down and its assets were sold off; or (3) if we are explicitly considering liquidation. The adjusted book value approach might also be used as a common-sense check when using one of the other valuation approaches. If your value estimate is lower than the adjusted book value when you use another approach, it might indicate that there is an error in your analysis. Of course, if you find no errors, this might also be an indication that you would be better off shutting down the business and liquidating it.

When using the adjusted book value approach to estimate the liquidation value of a business, we must make sure to subtract liquidation-related expenses such as sales commissions, legal and accounting fees, and the cost of dismantling and hauling away the assets. To see how the adjusted book value approach might be used to estimate the liquidation value of a business, consider the following situation. Last year you started a business that prints custom logos on T-shirts for business clients. Unfortunately, the economy went into a recession shortly after you started your business, and it never got off the ground. You have virtually run out of cash and have decided to shut down the business rather than invest any more money. The current balance sheet of this business is as follows:

What is the liquidation value of your ownership interest in this business?

The first step in estimating the liquidation value of the business is to estimate how much value will be realized from the individual assets after accounting for liquidation costs. Let’s begin with the cash. Since the objective of the liquidation process is to convert all assets into cash, the liquidation value of any cash on the balance sheet, $78 in this example, simply equals its face value. Assuming that your customers are reputable businesspeople, you expect to collect all of the receivables with little effort. However, since you will incur some expenses in the collection process, you estimate that you will actually receive a net amount that equals 95 percent of the face value of the receivables. A call to your T-shirt supplier reveals that you can return unused inventory to the supplier and receive an 80 percent refund. You do not believe that anyone else will pay you more for the T-shirts. Finally, a supplier of T-shirt printing equipment has offered to pay you $600, or 75 percent of the book value, for your printing press.

Assets:		Liabilities and Equity:	
Cash	$ 78	Accounts payable	$ 480
Accounts receivable	2,368	Loan balance	2,000
T-shirt inventory	1,600	Stockholders’ equity	 2,366
Printing press	 800		
Total assets	$4,846	Total liab. & equity	$4,846
With this information, you estimate that the liquidation value of the assets is $4,208:

Therefore, after paying your accounts payable and the loan, your equity ownership interest has a liquidation value of $4,208 − $480 − $2,000 = $1,728.

Problem

You are considering purchasing a company that manufactures specialized components for recreational vehicles. These components are sold to the companies that manufacture the vehicles. As part of your analysis of this opportunity, you decide to estimate the liquidation value of the company. Management has provided you with the following information about its assets. All values are in thousands of dollars.

Cash	  $ 444
Accounts receivable	      739
Inventory	   1,436
Net PP&E	 8,463
Total assets	$11,082
Management has also told you that you can reasonably expect to collect 93 percent of the receivables (accounting for collection expenses), that the inventory can be sold to realize 85 percent of its book value, and that sale of the property, plant, and equipment would yield $6,100. What is the liquidation value of this company?





Market Approaches

Two market approaches are commonly used in business valuation. The first approach, which is often called multiples analysis, uses stock price or other value multiples that are observed for similar public companies to estimate the value of a company or its equity. The second approach, often called transactions analysis, uses information from transactions involving the sale of similar companies to estimate the value of a company or its stock.

multiples analysis a valuation approach that uses stock price or other value multiples for public companies to estimate the value of another company’s stock or its entire business

transactions analysis a valuation approach that uses transactions data from the sale of similar companies to estimate the value of another company’s stock or its entire business

Market approaches reflect prices that have actually been paid for a company’s stock or for the entire company. While it is not always obvious why people pay a particular price, the information on what they pay can yield useful insights into how those people view the prospects for similar businesses. Market approaches can also provide useful benchmarks against which valuations based on other methodologies can be compared.

Multiples Analysis
Multiples analysis is widely used in business valuation. This approach involves: (1) identifying publicly traded companies engaged in business activities that are similar to those of the company being analyzed and (2) using the prices at which shares of those comparables are trading, along with accounting data, to estimate the value of the equity of a company of interest or its entire value. Multiples analysis can be especially useful in estimating the price at which the stock of a private company can be sold. For example, this approach is often used to help identify the price at which shares can be sold when a company does its initial public offering (IPO) or when some or all of its shares are being sold privately to investors.

Price/earnings (P/E) and price/revenue multiples (ratios) are commonly used to directly estimate the value of the stock in a company. These ratios divide a measure of stock price by an accounting measure of profits and revenue, respectively. Analysts typically estimate one of these multiples using data from comparable public companies, and then they use an average or, if one comparable is clearly better than the others, a multiple from a single comparable company to estimate the value of the company of interest.

Suppose, for example, that we want to estimate the value of the equity of a private department store chain that we are considering purchasing. The chain earned net income of $3.65 million last year. We have identified a publicly traded company that is very similar to the company we are valuing and notice on the financial Web site CNBC.com that the P/E ratio for its common stock is 17.63. From this information, we can estimate that the market value of the equity (VE) of the company that we are considering purchasing is:

It is important to recognize that because the stock of the comparable companies is publicly traded and shares that are bought and sold in public markets are more liquid than shares that are not publicly traded, we must be careful when using multiples analysis to value a private company. The prices paid for shares that are not publicly traded can be considerably less than the prices paid for public shares. While the size of this marketability discount depends on many factors, such as the fraction of the total shares being bought or sold, it can amount to more than 30 percent in some instances.3

A multiples analysis is conceptually straightforward but can be difficult use in practice. One complicating factor is that truly comparable public companies are difficult to find. The ideal comparable company would match the company being valued on many dimensions. It would sell the same products, compete in the same markets, be of similar size, have similar revenue growth prospects, have similar profit margins, and have similar management quality, among other characteristics. In addition, if an equity ratio (such as price/earnings or price/revenue) is being used, the comparable should have a similar capital structure because, all else being equal, capital structure can have a dramatic impact on those ratios.

The importance of identifying comparable companies that are similar to the company being analyzed can be illustrated by considering the characteristics that determine a company’s price/earnings multiple. Recall from Chapters 9 and 13 that the constant-growth dividend model, Equation 9.4, can be used to estimate the value of a share of stock. Using the notation from Chapter 13, this model can be written as:

where P0 is the current stock price, D1 is the dividend that is expected next year, kcs is the required return on common stock, and g is the expected growth rate in dividends. If we recognize that dividends equal the fraction of earnings distributed to the stockholders times the earnings of the firm, we can rewrite Equation 9.4 as:

where E1 is the earnings per share expected next year and b is the fraction of the firm’s earnings that is paid out as dividends. (b, which is known as the dividend payout ratio, is referred to in the summary of the Lintner study in Section 17.5 of Chapter 17 and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 19). Finally, we can rearrange this equation to obtain the price/earnings multiple:

(18.1)
This equation tells us that the P/E multiple can be thought of as equal to the dividend payout ratio over kcs minus g.4

By focusing on the variables that drive the P/E multiple in this simple framework, we can see the importance of identifying comparable companies that are as similar to the company of interest as possible. For example, consider what company characteristics determine kcs. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) tells us that kcs depends on beta, which is a measure of the systematic risk associated with a company’s stock price. Since this systematic risk is closely related to the volatility of the earnings of the company, our discussion of total risk in Chapter 16 (see the discussion of Exhibit 16.3) suggests that the cost of equity depends on both business and financial risk. In other words, it depends on things such as the products the company sells, the markets it sells them in, its profit margins, and its operating and financial leverage. The growth rate of dividends, g, is determined by the same factors that affect kcs. This means that if we cannot identify a comparable company that is similar to the company of interest in both its business and financial characteristics, the P/E multiple we obtain for the comparable company will not be a good measure for our analysis.

Because P/E ratios are sensitive to leverage, many analysts use ratios that divide the total value of a company’s equity plus its debt by an accounting measure of cash flows available to all providers of capital (debt and equity). These ratios provide a direct measure of the total value of a company’s equity plus its debt, which is known as its enterprise value.5 The total value of the firm was written in Equation 16.1 as VFirm = VDebt + VEquity. In the interest of brevity, we will write it in this chapter as:

enterprise value the value of a company’s equity plus the value of its debt; also, the present value of the total free cash flows the company’s assets are expected to generate in the future

where VF is the value of the firm, VD is the value of the debt, and VE is the value of the equity. Multiples that are based on the total value of the firm are known as enterprise multiples. Examples include Enterprise value/revenue and Enterprise value/EBITDA.

To see how an enterprise multiple can be used to estimate the total value of a firm, let’s return to the example in which we were valuing the department store chain. Assume that, in addition to the P/E ratio analysis, we want to estimate the enterprise value of the business using an Enterprise value/EBITDA ratio. We have estimated that EBITDA last year was $8.67 million for the department store chain we are valuing. On CNBC.com, we find that the current price of the comparable company’s stock is $31.25, and, from the balance sheet in the annual report, we observe that the comparable company has 3.67 million shares outstanding. We also estimate that the value of the comparable company’s outstanding debt is $19.46 million, and we note that EBITDA for this company was $14.35 million last year. Using this information, we can calculate the Enterprise value/EBITDA ratio for the comparable company as follows:

and we can estimate the enterprise value for the company we are valuing as:

Problem

In addition to performing the liquidation analysis in Learning by Doing Application 18.1, you have decided to estimate the enterprise value of the company that manufactures specialized components for recreational vehicles. You have collected the following information for a comparable company and for the company you are valuing:

Comparable company:	Company you are valuing:
 Stock price = $10.62	 Value of debt = $1.25 million
 Number of shares outstanding = 9.55 million	 EBITDA last year = $2.37 million
 Value of debt = $11.67 million	 Net income last year = $0.45 million
 EBITDA last year = $10.85 million	
 Net income last year = $2.67 million	
Estimate the enterprise value of the company you are valuing using the P/E and Enterprise value/EBITDA multiples.





Whenever we use multiples analysis, we must remember that we are estimating the fair market value of a company’s equity or its enterprise value, and that this value is based on transactions involving small ownership interests. The transaction prices that we observe in the stock market are typically based on trades that involve unknown investors buying small numbers of shares that do not give them the ability to control the business. In other words, a multiples analysis does not provide an estimate of investment value because the identities of the buyers are not known and the transactions for shares do not convey control over the company to the new owner. This means that value estimates based on a multiples analysis do not reflect the synergies that might be realized by combining the company with another business. These estimates also do not include the value associated with being able to control a business, an important consideration that we discuss in more detail later.

When performing a multiples analysis, it is also important to make sure that the numerator and the denominator of the ratio we are using are consistent with each other. In other words, if stock price is in the numerator, some measure of cash flow to equity must be in the denominator. If enterprise value is in the numerator, a measure of total cash flows from the entire business must be in the denominator.

The exception to this rule is the price/revenue ratio. This ratio can be useful in valuing the stock of a relatively young company that is not yet generating profits. Shares in very young companies are often bought and sold based on multiples of their revenue. Implicit in those multiples are expectations about future margins, as well as growth in revenue. By using price to revenue, the analyst is effectively assuming that the company being analyzed will, over time, have profit margins similar to those that are anticipated by the market in pricing the publicly traded comparables.

Another important point to keep in mind when doing multiples analysis is that the data used to compute the multiple for the comparable company should include the stock price as of the valuation date and that accounting data for the two companies should be from the same period. Since any value estimate is specific to a particular date, we must be sure to use multiples for the appropriate point in time. Furthermore, if we use accounting data from the past 12 months to estimate the ratio for a comparable company, we must use accounting data from the same 12-month period to calculate the value of the company of interest.

Transactions Analysis
The information used in a transactions analysis is typically obtained from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings of public companies that have acquired other companies or from commercial services that collect and sell this information. This information is used to compute the same types of multiples that are used in a multiples analysis, and these multiples are used in the same way to value a company. Transaction data reflect the price that a particular investor paid for an entire company. For this reason, it provides an estimate of the investment value to that investor.

Like multiples analysis, transactions analysis can be difficult to use in practice, although the reasons for the difficulty are different. One problem is that transactions data are not typically as reliable as the data available for multiples analysis, especially when the transactions involve private companies. For example, the available data on transactions might include revenues of the private company, but not data on its profitability. The data might include the net income but not enough information to estimate EBITDA. This can make it difficult to compute some multiples.

In addition, unlike stock market transactions, transactions involving the purchase or sale of an entire business occur relatively infrequently. This means that the data available for a transactions analysis often include only transactions that occurred months or even years earlier. Since the value of a business is specific to a particular point in time, the price that was paid for a business becomes less useful as an indicator of what the business is worth as time passes after the sale.

Finally, the terms of the transactions can be difficult to assess. While the P/E multiple for a publicly traded company is an indication of the price that might be obtained in a cash transaction, transactions involving the sale of an entire company often involve some combination of cash, debt, and equity payments. A whole package of such securities, some of which can be difficult to value, could be included in the reported transaction price, and this may not be apparent to the analyst. The value estimates for those securities and claims can also be distorted if the buyer or seller has a reason to prefer reporting a higher or lower price.

Income Approaches

At the beginning of this section, we said that the value of a business is determined by the magnitude of the cash flows that it is expected to produce, the timing of those cash flows, and the likelihood that the cash flows will be realized. The cost and market approaches are useful for estimating this value in certain situations—such as in doing a buy-versus-build analysis or estimating the liquidation value of a firm or when good comparable firms or transactions are available. The most direct approaches for estimating the value of the cash flows a business is expected to produce, however, are the income approaches. Like NPV analysis, these approaches directly estimate the value of those cash flows.

Before we discuss specific income valuation approaches, we should note that the market and income approaches differ in one very important way. Because the market approaches rely on prices that have been paid for companies or their securities, the value estimates that they yield are estimates of what people are willing to pay. In contrast, the income approaches provide estimates of the intrinsic, or true, value of a company or its securities.

While the market value can equal the intrinsic value, the two values are not necessarily the same. For example, if you are valuing the company you work for, you might have better information about its prospects than do stock market investors. By using an income approach, you would be able to incorporate your superior information directly into the valuation analysis in a way that you would not be able to do with a market approach.

Using Income Approaches
The life of a business is not usually known when it is valued. Whereas a project might be expected to last a specific number of years, a business can have an indefinite life. This makes it more difficult to use an income approach to value a business than a project. It is difficult enough to forecast cash flows for a relatively short period, such as three or five years, let alone for the indefinite future.

Another complication in business valuation is that businesses often have cash or other assets that are not necessary for operations. These can include cash that was earned in the past but has not been distributed to stockholders and assets that are left over from old projects. We call these nonoperating assets (NOA). When we estimate the value of an individual project, we do not have to worry about NOA because there are none. However, when we value a business, NOA are an additional source of value. NOA can be distributed directly to stockholders or sold and the proceeds distributed to stockholders without affecting the cash flows that the operations of the business are expected to generate.

nonoperating assets (NOA) cash or other assets that are not required to support the operations of a business

In practice, we account for the indefinite life associated with a business and the possibility that it has NOA by estimating the value of the business as the sum of three numbers. This calculation can be represented as follows:

(18.2)
where VF is the value of the firm, PV(FCFT) is the present value of the free cash flows (FCF) that the business is expected to produce over the next T years, PV(TVT) is the present value of all free cash flows after year T, and NOA is the value of all of the nonoperating assets in the firm. Note that the present value of all free cash flows after year T is generally known as the terminal value. Note also that if we only want to calculate the value of the equity, we can do this by first calculating the value of the firm using Equation 18.2 and then subtracting the value of the debt.

terminal value the value of the expected free cash flows beyond the period over which they are explicitly forecast

Free Cash Flow from the Firm Approach
When using the free cash flow from the firm (FCFF) approach, an analyst values the free cash flows that the assets of the firm are expected to produce in the future. The present value of these free cash flows equals the total value of the firm, or its enterprise value.

free cash flow from the firm (FCFF) approach an income approach to valuation in which all free cash flows the assets are expected to generate in the future are discounted to estimate the enterprise value

The free cash flows used in a FCFF analysis are almost identical to the free cash flows from the left-hand side of the finance balance sheet that was illustrated in Exhibit 13.1. The only difference is that when we value a business, we do not include cash flows necessary to pay short-term liabilities that do not have interest charges associated with them, such as accounts payable and accrued expenses. The costs associated with these noninterest-bearing current liabilities, which are included in the firm’s cost of sales and other operating expenses, are subtracted in the calculation of FCFF. Exhibit 18.3 shows precisely what we are referring to when we refer to the value of FCFF.

The most common FCFF approach involves using the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), which we discussed in Chapter 13, to discount the FCFF. This is often referred to as the WACC valuation method. In this approach, the total value of the firm (VF) is computed as the present value of the FCFF, discounted by the firm’s WACC:

(18.3)
In this equation, t equals the period when the cash flow is produced.

We compute the FCFF using the same calculation that we used for the free cash flows for a project in Chapter 11. The only differences are that (1) since business valuation involves valuing all of the projects in the firm, we compute the total after-tax free cash flows the firm’s assets are expected to produce rather than the incremental after-tax free cash flows from a project and (2) we use the average tax rate instead of the marginal tax rate. The FCFF calculation is shown in Exhibit 18.4. Notice that this calculation is just like the calculation in Exhibit 11.1.

EXHIBIT 18.3 The Finance Balance Sheet and Firm Value The value of a firm (enterprise value) equals the present value of the future free cash flows from the firm (FCFF). Since the owners of the interest-bearing debt and other long-term liabilities and the stockholders, collectively, have the right to receive all of the FCFF, the total value of those claims equals the value of the firm.


Analysts typically estimate future FCFF by forecasting each of the individual components and then performing the calculation shown in Exhibit 18.4. Next, the resulting FCFF values are discounted back to the present using the WACC, as already mentioned. Recall that the WACC is calculated using Equation 13.7:

EXHIBIT 18.4 The FCFF Calculation

Free cash flows from the firm (FCFF) are calculated in the same way as the incremental after-tax free cash flows (FCF) that are expected from a project. The only differences between the FCFF calculation and the FCF calculation, which is illustrated in Exhibit 11.1, are that in the FCFF calculation (1) we use total cash flows rather than incremental cash flows, and (2) we use the average tax rate instead of the marginal tax rate when we are valuing a company that is operating independent of any other company.

where xDebt pretax + xps + xcs = 1 and where kDebt pretax, kps, and kcs are the pretax cost of debt and the after-tax costs of preferred stock and common stock, respectively. Also, t is the tax rate that applies to interest deductions, and xDebt, xps, xcs are the proportions of the value of the firm that are represented by debt, preferred stock, and common stock.

When analysts use the WACC approach to value a business, they must make an assumption about how the firm’s operations will be financed in the future. For example, the financing might be 80 percent equity and 20 percent debt. Or it might be 30 percent equity and 70 percent debt. These are very important assumptions because, as we saw in Chapter 16 (see Exhibit 16.8), the capital structure choice affects the value of the firm. The FCFF calculation is not affected by the firm’s capital structure, but from Equation 18.3 we know that capital structure affects firm value by affecting the discount rate—the WACC. In fact, as we discussed in Chapter 16, the optimal capital structure for a business is the one that minimizes the WACC.

To see how the FCFF approach is used to value a business, consider an example involving Bell Mountain Manufacturing Company. Assume that we have forecast Bell Mountain’s FCFF for each of the next five years to be as shown in Exhibit 18.5. Also assume that we have estimated that the WACC for Bell Mountain will be 11 percent and that the cash flows after Year 5 will grow at an annual rate of 3 percent. Finally, we observe that Bell Mountain has excess cash of $14.68 million but no other NOA.

With this information, we can calculate the enterprise value of Bell Mountain Manufacturing Company using Equation 18.2:

We begin by calculating the present value of the forecasted free cash flows in Exhibit 18.5. The present value of these cash flows is

In this example, we prepared cash flow forecasts for five years. The length of the period for which detailed projections are produced depends on the level of uncertainty surrounding the future of the business. In general, we want to forecast the cash flows out to a point in time where we expect the business to reach a steady-state growth rate. We can then estimate the cash flows for the remainder of the business’s life (the terminal value) by (1) calculating the present value of all cash flows after the final year of the detailed forecast using the formula for a growing perpetuity and (2) discounting this value to the present. For Bell Mountain, these calculations are as follows:

Learning by Doing Application 18.3 presents another example of the application of the FCFF Income Approach.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 18.3
Using the FCFF Income Approach

Problem

You have decided to use the FCFF income approach to estimate the intrinsic value of the company that manufactures components for recreational vehicles. You expect the company’s cash flows to grow very rapidly during the next five years and to level off after that. Based on this, you forecast the cash flows for each of the next five years to be:

FCFF ($ millions)	Year
    1    	    2    	    3    	    4    	    5    
−$0.284	$0.108	$0.998	$2.110	$2.857
You expect cash flows to be constant after Year 5. There are no NOA in this firm. If the appropriate WACC is 9 percent, what is the enterprise value of this business? What is the value of the equity if the value of the company’s debt equals $1.25 million?





Free Cash Flow to Equity Approach
The free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approach is very similar to the FCFF approach. However, instead of valuing the total cash flows the assets of the business are expected to generate, we value only the portion of the cash flows that are available for distribution to stockholders. To see how the FCFF and FCFE approaches are related, ask yourself the following question: If you wanted to value only the equity claims, how would you adjust the cash flows that are used in the FCFF approach? The answer is that you would simply strip out the cash flows to or from the people who lend money to the firm. Since the value of the firm equals the value of the debt plus the value of the equity, stripping out the cash flows to or from the lenders leaves the cash flows available to stockholders.

free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approach an income approach to valuation in which all cash flows that are expected to be available for distribution to stockholders in the future are discounted to estimate the value of the equity

Exhibit 18.6 shows how the cash flows in the FCFE approach are calculated. Notice that this calculation includes three cash flows that are not in the FCFF calculation. One is the interest expense, which is a cash flow to the lenders. The others are the cash flows associated with the repayment of debt principal and the proceeds from new debt issues. The FCFE approach takes the total after-tax free cash flows from the business and removes any cash flows to or from lenders, leaving the after-tax free cash flows available to the stockholders.

EXHIBIT 18.6 The FCFE Calculation

Free cash flow to equity (FCFE) equals free cash flow from the firm (FCFF) less any net cash outflows to debt holders. In the FCFE calculation, we subtract the interest and principal payments to the debt holders and add any proceeds from the sale of new debt.

Explanation	Calculation	Formula
The firm’s cash income		
Adjustments for the impact of depreciation and amortization, investments on FCFF, and debt repayments and new issues
Because cash flows available to stockholders are residual cash flows, they are riskier than the total cash flows from the firm (assuming the firm has some debt). In addition, unlike the cash flows in the FCFF approach, the cash flows here only go to the stockholders. Consequently, in using the FCFE valuation approach, the cost of equity (kE) is used to discount the cash flows:

(18.4)
Note that kE equals kcs if the firm has no preferred stock outstanding. Otherwise kE is a weighted average of kcs and kps. Other than the difference in the way that the cash flows are calculated, the procedure for estimating the value of a firm’s equity using the FCFE approach is the same as that used to estimate the total value of the firm using the FCFF approach.

Dividend Discount Model Approach
The dividend discount model (DDM) approach is very similar to the FCFE approach. In this approach, we estimate the value of equity directly by discounting cash flows to stockholders. However, there is a subtle difference. The DDM approach values the stream of cash flows that stockholders expect to receive through dividend payments. In contrast, the FCFE approach values cash flows that are available for distribution to stockholders. The firm may or may not be expected to distribute all available cash flows in any particular year.

dividend discount model (DDM) approach an income approach to valuation in which all dividends that are expected to be distributed to stockholders in the future are discounted to estimate the value of the equity

The constant-growth dividend model, Equation 9.4, is an example of a DDM:

Notice that in this model the price of a share of common stock is computed by discounting future dividends.

Since the constant-growth model assumes that the firm pays dividends and that these dividends will increase at a constant rate forever, this approach is really useful for only a limited number of mature firms that pay dividends. More often, use of the DDM approach involves discounting dividends that either will not begin until some point in the future or that are currently growing at a high rate that is not sustainable in the long run. In these cases, an approach such as that illustrated for the FCFF approach above must be used. The expected dividends must be individually discounted for some period, and then a terminal value must be estimated once the growth rate in dividends stabilizes at some level that is sustainable over the long run. This is the mixed (supernormal) growth dividend model from Chapter 9.

18.4 Important Issues in Valuation
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain how valuations can differ between public and private companies and between young and mature companies, and discuss the importance of control and key person considerations in valuation.
We conclude the chapter by discussing some important issues in valuing businesses. Whether a business is public or private, whether it is young or old, and whether a minority interest or a controlling interest is involved can make a difference in valuation. In addition, we may have to take account of the role of key employees.

Public versus Private Companies
The same valuation approaches are used to value both public and private companies. However, there are some important differences, which we consider next.

Financial Statements

While financial statements of public companies must be audited and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there is no requirement that the financial statements of private companies be audited. As a result, the completeness and reliability of financial statements for private companies vary considerably. Some private companies have complete, audited financial statements, whereas others have incomplete financial statements that are not prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) discussed in Chapter 3. Incomplete and unreliable financial statements can complicate the process of valuing a private business, making it more difficult to accurately assess its value.

Financial statements of private companies also differ from those of public companies in some of the expense accounts. Owners of private businesses have incentives to pass some of their personal expenses through the business because this enables them to deduct the expenses from their taxes. Examples might include the owner’s car, “business” trips to Hawaii or Europe, the company condominium in New York, or the sky box at the local football stadium. While there may be legitimate reasons for a business to incur expenses such as these—for example, entertaining important customers in the sky box—there are often more such expenses in private companies.

Owners of private companies can also have incentives to pay themselves more than it would cost to hire someone to do their job. If the income from the company is taxed before it is distributed to the owners (such as in a C-corporation), this excess compensation reduces the taxes that the company must pay. Compensation payments are deductible for the corporation and are therefore only taxed as income to the owner. If instead of paying themselves excess compensation, owners distributed the money as dividends, it would be taxed twice—once as income to the corporation and a second time as income to the owner. In addition to having incentives to pay themselves excess compensation, owners of private companies often put family members on the payroll at wages that are above what would ordinarily be paid for the services they provide. When valuing a private company, analysts typically adjust for excess compensation to the owner and family members by estimating what it would cost to hire other people to perform the services and, using this, change the actual expense reported in the income statement accordingly.

Marketability

In the discussion of multiples analysis, we mentioned that the prices paid for shares in a company whose stock is not publicly traded can be considerably less than the prices paid for publicly traded shares of a similar company. One reason is that stockholders of a public firm can generally sell their shares at close to their true value by simply going online or calling a broker and paying a small fee. In contrast, a stockholder in a private firm may have to spend considerable resources (both money and time) to sell his or her shares. An investor who is offered the opportunity to buy identical equity claims to the cash flows of a public and a private firm (that is, the cash flows have the same size, timing, and risk) will require different rates of return for the two investments. Because of the higher transaction costs associated with the stock of the private firm, the investor will not be willing to pay as much for that stock as for the publicly traded shares and will therefore expect a higher return. This must be taken into account in estimating the value of any claim to the cash flows of a firm. As we mentioned earlier, differences in marketability can result in discounts of 30 percent or more for shares of private companies. Where analysts are able to estimate the appropriate size of such a discount, they deduct the discount directly from the final value estimate that is obtained using the methods described in the preceding section.

Young (Rapidly Growing) versus Mature Companies
Another important issue that arises in business valuation concerns the fact that young, rapidly growing companies tend to be more difficult to value than mature, stable companies. Both entrepreneurs and investors in new businesses, such as venture capitalists, must deal with these difficulties when young companies seek financing. One factor that makes it more difficult to value a young company is that less reliable historical information is available. A company may have only two or three years of historical financial records, and those records may reflect the company at a different stage in its development.

In addition, the future of a young, rapidly growing company is often less certain than that of a mature company because much of the young company’s future growth depends on investment, operating, and financing decisions that have not yet been made. This makes it much more complicated to identify appropriate comparable companies for a multiples or transactions analysis and more difficult to estimate expected cash flows for an income analysis.

Furthermore, many young, rapidly growing companies are not yet profitable. With no profits, it is difficult to use earnings multiples to value the business, leaving price/revenue or Enterprise value/revenue multiples as the only viable alternatives for a multiples analysis. When analysts use these multiples, they are implicitly assuming that the business they are valuing will become as profitable (specifically, have the same profit margins) as the public companies that were used to estimate the multiples and that the risks of the business will also be similar. These can be very heroic assumptions when the company being valued is only a couple of years old.

Finally, many young companies invest a considerable amount of money in order to grow. This can make it very difficult to use an income valuation approach. The cash flows will be negative until the business becomes profitable and its profits exceed its investment expenditures. Since it can take several years for this to happen, expected cash flows are typically negative for several years. This means that positive cash flows, which represent the value that the business is expected to produce for its owners, are further in the future and are therefore less certain. The bottom line is that this increases the overall level of uncertainty associated with an income-based valuation.

Controlling Interest versus Minority Interest
Another important issue that we must consider when we value a business is whether we are valuing a controlling ownership interest or a minority interest. The amount of stock required for an investor to exercise control varies depending on the ownership structure of the company. For example, a stockholder with just 20 percent, or possibly even less, of the total votes in a public company can effectively control that company if there are no other large stockholders. Even if there are other large stockholders, that investor can control the public company if friendly stockholders provide enough additional votes. In private companies, which tend to have relatively few stockholders, a stockholder must generally control 50 percent of the shares, either directly or indirectly through friendly stockholders, to control the firm. A stockholder who has such control can run the business as he or she wants. This stockholder can select the board of directors, choose the business strategy, hire and fire managers, and approve or disapprove any investment, operating, or financing decisions.

Whether a controlling ownership interest is being valued has important implications for a valuation analysis. Recall that in the discussion of multiples analysis we noted that a multiples analysis does not reflect the value associated with being able to control a business. Thus, when we are using multiples computed using public stock market prices to estimate the value of a controlling interest, we must make adjustments to reflect the benefits of control. Similarly, when we use an income approach to value a business, the cash flow forecasts and discount rate assumptions we use will differ depending on whether we are valuing a minority or a controlling ownership interest.

Let’s consider an example of how these differences arise when the income approach is used. Suppose we are valuing 100 shares of Hewlett-Packard (HP) stock. Since owning 100 shares of HP stock will not enable us to exercise any control, the expected cash flows that we should discount simply reflect the cash flows that we can expect HP to generate under its current management (assuming we know of no imminent management change). In contrast, if we are valuing a controlling interest in HP stock for a potential buyer, we would discount the cash flows that HP would be expected to generate if it were under the control of that buyer.

It is also important to note that the market rates of return that we use to calculate the cost of equity with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) discussed in Chapter 7 are based on small stock transactions. If having control would enable an investor to better manage the systematic risk associated with a business, a discount rate based on small transactions would be higher than a discount rate estimated from a transaction that involves a controlling position. Therefore, a discount rate estimated using public stock market information and CAPM might be too high for a valuation that involves a controlling position.

Unfortunately, while the discount rate we estimate using CAPM might be too high when we value a controlling interest, the CAPM theory provides us with no insights concerning how we might adjust that rate. As a result, analysts typically adjust for the effects of an incorrect discount rate (as well as for any possible cash flows that are not reflected in an income-based valuation) by adding a control premium. For instance, if the value of a firm’s equity is estimated to be $100 million using an income approach, a 20 percent premium might be added to arrive at a final value of $120 million. Of course, the magnitude of the adjustment depends on the situation.

control premium an adjustment that is made to a business value estimate to reflect value associated with control that is not already reflected in the analysis

Key People
If the cash flows that a business is expected to generate depend heavily on the retention of a particular individual or group of individuals, then the analyst must also consider whether it is appropriate to adjust the estimated value of the business for the likelihood that these “key people” may not remain with the firm as long as expected. An example of a key person might be the CEO of a service firm who has strong personal ties with the major customers. If an analyst believes that those customers might transfer their business to a competitor if the CEO departs, then a key person discount may be appropriate. The issue is similar to the one that arises when a firm receives a significant portion of its business from a small number of customers. In either case, it is difficult to forecast the cash flows for the firm.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Explain why the choice of organizational form is important, and describe two financial considerations that are especially important in starting a business.

The choice of organizational form is important because it affects the returns from a business in a number of ways. For example, it affects the cost of getting started, the life of the business, management’s ability to raise capital and grow the business, the control of the business, the ability to attract and retain good managers, the exposure of the investors to liability, and the taxes that are paid on the earnings of the business.

Two especially important financial considerations are the pretax operating cash flow break-even point for the business and its overall cash inflows and outflows. The pretax operating cash flow break-even point represents the level of unit sales that must be achieved in order for the business to break even on a cash flow basis. Entrepreneurs must also understand where money is coming from, where it is going, and how much external financing is likely to be needed and when. The cash budget helps them address all of these issues.

2 Describe the key components of a business plan, and explain what a business plan is used for.

The key components of a business plan include the executive summary, a company overview, a description of the company’s products and services, a market analysis, a discussion of marketing and sales activities, a discussion of the business’s operations, a discussion of the management team, the ownership structure of the firm, capital requirements and uses, and financial forecasts.

A business plan helps an entrepreneur set the goals and objectives for a company, serves as a benchmark for evaluating and controlling the company’s performance, and helps communicate the entrepreneur’s ideas to managers and others (including investors) outside the firm.

3 Explain the three general approaches to valuation, and value a business using common business valuation approaches.

The three general valuation approaches are (1) cost approaches, (2) market approaches, and (3) income approaches. Cost approaches commonly used in business valuation are the replacement cost and adjusted book value approaches. The market approaches are multiples analysis and transactions analysis. Three key income approaches are the free cash flow from the firm, free cash flow to equity, and dividend discount approaches. The application of these approaches is discussed in Section 18.3.

4 Explain how valuations can differ between public and private companies and between young and mature companies, and discuss the importance of control and key person considerations in valuation.

Valuations differ between public and private companies for a number of reasons, including (1) the quality of the financial statements and (2) the marketability of the securities being valued. Young, rapidly growing companies are more difficult to value than mature companies because there is less reliable historical information about them, and their futures tend to be less certain. Marketability is important because it affects the price that investors are willing to pay for a security. The less marketable a security, the lower the price investors are willing to pay.

Control is an important consideration in business valuation because having control of a business provides an investor with more flexibility in managing the business. Investors value this flexibility and will therefore pay more for a controlling interest in a company.

If the cash flows that a business is expected to generate depend heavily on certain employees, those employees are key people. When valuing a business, an analyst must account for the possibility that the key people will unexpectedly leave the company and must consider the associated impact on the company’s cash flows.

Self-Study Problems
18.1 Your sister wants to open a store that sells antique-style jewelry and accessories. She has $15,000 of savings to invest, but opening the store will require an initial investment of $20,000. Net cash inflows are expected to be −$2,000, −$1,000, and $0 in the first three months. It is expected that, as the store becomes better known, net cash inflows will become +$500 in the fourth month and grow at a constant rate of 5 percent in the following months. You want to help your sister by providing the additional money that she needs. How much money will you have to invest each month to start the store and keep it operating with a minimum cash balance of $1,000?



18.2 You have the following information for a company you are valuing and for a comparable company:

Comparable company	Company you are valuing
Stock price = $23.45	Value of debt = $3.68 million
Number of shares outstanding = 6.23 million	Est. EBITDA next year = $4.4 million
Value of debt = $18.45 million	Est. income next year =
Est. EBITDA next year = $17.0 million	$1.5 million
Est. income next year = $5.3 million	
Estimate the enterprise value of the company you are evaluating using the P/E and Enterprise value/EBITDA multiples.

 

18.3 How do the cash flows that are discounted when the WACC approach (FCFF approach) is used to value a business differ from those that are discounted when the free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approach is used to value the equity in a business?



18.4 You are valuing a company using the WACC approach and have estimated that the free cash flows from the firm (FCFF) in the next five years will be $36.7, $42.6, $45.1, $46.3, and $46.6 million, respectively. Beginning in Year 6, you expect the cash flows to decrease at a rate of 3 percent per year for the indefinite future. You estimate that the appropriate WACC to use in discounting these cash flows is 10 percent. What is the value of this company?



18.5 You want to estimate the value of a local advertising firm. The earnings of the firm are expected to be $2 million next year. Based on expected earnings next year, the average price-to-earnings ratio of similar firms in the same industry is 48. Therefore, you estimate the value of the firm you are valuing to be $96 million.

Further investigation shows that a large portion of the firm’s business is obtained through connections that John Smith, a senior partner of the firm, has with various advertising executives at customer firms. Smith only recently started working with his junior partners to establish similar relationships with these customers.

Smith is approaching 65 years of age and might announce his retirement at the next board meeting. If he does retire, revenues will drop significantly, and earnings are estimated to shrink by 30 percent. You estimate that the probability that Smith will retire this year is 50 percent. If he does not retire this year, you expect that he will have sufficient time to work with his junior partners so that his departure will not affect earnings when he departs. How does this information affect your estimate of the value of the firm?

18.8 Multiples analysis: It is April 7, 2021, and your company is considering the possibility of purchasing the Chrysler automobile manufacturing business. Managers of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., the automobile manufacturer that owns Chrysler, have hinted that they might be interested in selling Chrysler. Since Chrysler does not have publicly traded shares of its own, you have decided to use Ford Motor Company as a comparable company to help you determine the market value of Chrysler.

This morning, Ford’s common stock was trading at $11.75 per share, and the company had 3.9 billion shares outstanding. You estimated that the market value of all of the company’s other outstanding securities (excluding the common stock but including special shares owned by the Ford family) is $35 billion and that its revenues from auto sales were $155 billion last year.

The TV option, which costs $50,000 annually, will promote the product more effectively and create a demand for 1,200 units per year. The flyer advertisement option costs only $6,000 annually, but will create a demand for only 250 units per year. The price per unit of the indoor gardening system is $100, and the variable cost is $60 per unit. Assume that the production capacity is not limited and that the marketing cost is the only fixed cost involved in your business. What are the break-even points for both marketing options?

Use the following information concerning Johnson Machine Tool Company in Problems 18.17, 18.18, and 18.19.

Johnson’s income statement from the fiscal year that ended this past December is:

Revenue	$995
Cost of goods sold	  652
Gross profit	$343
Selling, general, and administrative expenses	  135
Operating profit (EBIT)	$208
Interest expense	    48
Earnings before taxes	$160
Taxes	    64
Net income	$ 96
All dollar values are in millions. Depreciation and amortization expenses last year were $42 million, and the company has $533 million of debt outstanding.

18.17 Multiples analysis: You are an analyst at a private equity firm that buys private companies, improves their operating performance, and sells them for a profit. Your boss has asked you to estimate the fair market value of the Johnson Machine Tool Company. Billy’s Tools is a public company with business operations that are virtually identical to those at Johnson. The most recent income statement for Billy’s Tools is as follows:

Revenue	$1,764
Cost of goods sold	 1,168
Gross profit	$ 596
Selling, general, and administrative expenses	    211
Operating profit (EBIT)	$ 385
Interest expense	    12
Earnings before taxes	$ 373
Taxes	    147
Net income	$ 226
All dollar values are in millions. Billy’s had depreciation and amortization expenses of $71 million last year and had 200 million shares and $600 million of debt outstanding as of the end of the year. Its stock is currently trading at $12.25 per share.

Using the P/E multiple, what is the per share value of Johnson’s stock? What is the total value of Johnson Machine Tool Company?

18.18 Multiples analysis: Using the Enterprise value/EBITDA multiple, what is the total value of Johnson Machine Tool Company? What is the per share value of Johnson’s stock?

18.19 Multiples analysis: Which of the above multiples analyses do you believe is more accurate for valuing the firm and its stock?

18.20 Income approaches: You are using the FCFF approach to value a business. You have estimated that the FCFF for next year will be $123.65 million and that it will increase at a rate of 8 percent for each of the following four years. After that point, the FCFF will increase at a rate of 3 percent forever. If the WACC for this firm is 10 percent and it has no NOA, what is it worth?

18.21 Valuing a private business: You want to estimate the value of a privately owned restaurant that is financed entirely with equity. Its most recent income statement is as follows:

Revenue	$ 3,000,000
Cost of goods sold	      600,000
Gross profit	$ 2,400,000
Salaries and wages	    1,400,000
Selling expenses	       100,000
Operating profit (EBIT)	$  900,000
Taxes	       315,000
Net income	$   585,000
You note that the profitability of this restaurant is significantly lower than that of comparable restaurants, primarily due to high salary and wage expenses. Further investigation reveals that the annual salaries for the owner and his wife, the firm’s accountant, are $900,000 and $300,000, respectively. These salaries are much higher than the industry median salaries for these two positions of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. Compensation for other employees ($200,000 in total) appears to be consistent with the market rates. The median P/E ratio of comparable restaurants with no debt is 10. What is the total value of this restaurant?

18.22 Valuing a private business: A few years ago, a friend of yours started a small business that develops gaming software. The company is doing well and is valued at $1.5 million based on multiples for comparable public companies after adjustments for their lack of marketability. With 300,000 shares outstanding, each share is estimated to be worth $5. Your friend, who has been serving as CEO and CTO (chief technology officer), has decided that he lacks sufficient managerial skills to continue to build the company. He wants to sell his 160,000 shares and invest the money in an MBA education. You believe you have the appropriate managerial skills to run the company. Would you pay $5 each for these shares? What are some of the factors you should consider in making this decision?

Advanced
18.23 You plan to start a business that sells waterproof sun block with a unique formula that reduces the damage of UVA radiation 30 percent more effectively than similar products on the market.

You expect to invest $50,000 in plant and equipment to begin the business. The targeted price of the sun block is $15 per bottle. You forecast that unit sales will total 1,500 bottles in the first month and will increase by 20 percent in each of the following months during the first year. You expect the cost of raw materials to be $3 per bottle. In addition, monthly gross wages and payroll are expected to be $13,000, rent is expected to be $3,000, and other expenses are expected to total $1,000. Advertising costs are estimated to be $35,000 in the first month, but to remain constant at $5,000 per month during the following eleven months.

You have decided to finance the entire business at one time using your own savings. Is an initial investment of $75,000 adequate to avoid a negative cash balance in any given month? If not, how much more do you need to invest up front? How much do you need to invest up front to keep a minimum cash balance of $5,000? What is the break-even point for the business?

18.24 For the previous question, assume that you do not have sufficient savings to cover the entire amount required to start your sun-block business. You are going to have to get external financing. A local banker whom you know has offered you a six-month loan of $20,000 at an APR of 12 percent. You will pay interest each month and repay the entire principal at the end of six months.

Assume that instead of making a single up-front investment, you are going to finance the business by making monthly investments as cash is needed in the business. If the proceeds from the loan go directly into the business on the first day and are therefore available to pay for some of the capital expenditures, how much money will you need to take from your savings account every month to run the business and keep the cash balances positive?

18.25 Your friend is starting a new company. He wants to write a business plan to clarify the company’s business outlook and raise venture capital. Knowing that you have taken this course, he has asked you, as a favor, to help him prepare a template for a business plan. Prepare a template that includes the key elements of a business plan.

18.26 A friend of yours is trying to value the equity of a company and, knowing that you have read this book, has asked for your help. So far she has tried to use the FCFE approach. She estimated the cash flows to equity to be as follows:

Sales	$ 800.0
− CGS	−450.0
− Depreciation	  −80.0
− Interest	  −24.0
Earning before taxes (EBT)	$ 246.0
− Taxes (0.35 × EBT)	  −86.1
= Cash flow to equity	$ 159.9
She also computed the cost of equity using CAPM as follows:

where the beta is estimated for a comparable publicly traded company.

Using this cost of equity, she estimates the discount rate as

Based on this analysis, she concludes that the value of the equity is $159.9 million/0.14 = $1,142 million.

Assuming that the numbers used in this analysis are all correct, what advice would you give your friend regarding her analysis?

18.27 Forever Youth Technology is a biochemical company that is two years old. Its main product, an antioxidant drink that is supposed to energize the consumer and delay aging, is still under development. The company’s equity consists of $5 million invested by its founders and $5 million from a venture capitalist. The company has spent $3 million in each of the past two years, mostly on lab equipment and R&D costs. The company has had no sales so far. What are the challenges associated with valuing such a young and uncertain company?

18.28 Mad Rock Inc. is a company that sells music online. It is expected to generate earnings of $1 per share this year after its Web site is upgraded and online marketing is stepped up. The stock price of Mad Rock has rocketed from $8 to $95 per share in the past 12 months. The cost of capital for the company is 18 percent.

Of course, the future of a young Internet company such as Mad Rock is highly uncertain. Nevertheless, using the very limited information provided in this problem, do you think $95 per share could be a fair price for its stock? Support your argument with a simple analysis.

18.29 At the end of 2020, the value of the S&P 500 Index divided by the estimated 2020 earnings for S&P 500 firms (the S&P 500 P/E multiple) was 36.80. Assume that the long-term Treasury bond yield was 1.88 percent, the market risk premium was 6 percent, and firms in the S&P 500 were expected to pay out an average of 40.2 percent of their earnings as dividends in the future. At what rate were dividends paid by S&P 500 firms expected to grow in the future?

18.30 The S&P 500 P/E multiple of 36.80 at the end of 2020 was higher than its historical average of approximately 16. Some financial commentators argued that this meant that the firms in the S&P 500 were, on average, overvalued at the end of 2020. Based on your analysis in Problem 18.29 and the concepts covered in this book, do you think that these commentators are right or wrong? Explain your answer?

18.31 You own a company that produces and distributes online course packets for classes at local universities. You have asked a friend to invest $35,000 in the business. Your friend wants to know what the business is worth so that he can determine how much of the equity (e.g., what percentage) he should expect to receive for his investment. You offer to help him value the business.

The business is expected to generate revenue of $110,000 and incur cash operating expenses of $70,000 next year. Over the following three years, revenue and cash operating expenses are expected to increase 15 percent, 10 percent, and 7 percent. After Year 4, they are expected to grow 2 percent per year forever. Depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, and additions to working capital are expected to equal 5 percent, 6 percent, and 1 percent of revenue, respectively, in the future. You have determined that a target capital structure of 10 percent debt and 90 percent equity is reasonable for this business. With this capital structure, the pretax cost of debt will be 6 percent and the beta for the equity will be 1.30. The average tax rate for the business is 10 percent, and the marginal rate is 20 percent. The risk-free rate is 4.25 percent, and the market risk premium is 6.01 percent. What is a 100 percent equity interest in the business worth? What percentage of the equity should your friend get for his investment?

Sample Test Problems
18.1 You plan to start a business to produce and sell custom kitchen cabinets. The targeted price for each order of cabinets is $10,000. You estimate that you will receive orders for cabinets for eight kitchens in each of the first two months, nine kitchens in the third month, and ten kitchens in the fourth month. The cost of the equipment necessary to produce the cabinets is $105,000. You expect the cost of raw materials to be $3,000 per order. In addition, you expect monthly gross wages and payroll to be $27,000, rent to be $8,000, and other expenses to total $4,000. You also expect advertising costs to be $10,000 in the first month but to remain constant at $1,000 per month during the following three months. How much will you have to initially invest to ensure that you have a cash balance of $10,000 at the beginning of the second month? If you invest this amount, what will be your cash balance at the end of the fourth month?

18.3 Sessler Corporation is a private company that had EBIT of $186 million and depreciation and amortization of $22 million in the most recent fiscal year. At the end of that year, a similar, public firm has an Enterprise value/EBITDA multiple of 4.3. What is the implied enterprise value of Sessler?

18.4 Winters Inc. management estimates that the company will generate after-tax free cash flows from the firm (FCFF) of $12.5 million, $16.8 million, and $19.7 million, respectively, over the next three years. After that, FCFF are expected to grow at a constant 5 percent per year forever. The company has $5 million in nonoperating assets. If the appropriate WACC is 8 percent, what is the enterprise value of this business?

18.5 Do private companies have audited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP?

Notes
1 The owners of an LLC can elect for the LLC to be taxed as a C-corporation.
2 The actual result of the calculation shown here is −$4,456, rather than −$4,457. The $1 difference is due to rounding. The interest expense is actually $333.33 [(0.08/12) × $50,000 = $333.33], and the beginning cash balance is $6,096.67, which yields −$4,456.66.
3 Marketability discounts are also sometimes called discounts for lack of marketability or liquidity discounts.
4 This is not strictly true for most firms because it assumes that the stock price can be estimated using a constant-growth perpetuity model, and most firms either do not pay dividends at all or do not increase dividends at a constant rate. Nevertheless, this model does provide a useful way of thinking about P/E multiples.

CHAPTER 19
Financial Planning and Managing Growth

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Explain what a financial plan is and why financial planning is important.
Discuss how management uses financial planning models in the planning process, and explain the importance of sales forecasts in the construction of financial planning models.
Discuss how the relation between projected sales and the income statement and balance sheet accounts can be determined, and analyze a strategic investment decision using a percent of sales model.
Describe the conditions under which fixed assets vary directly with sales, and discuss the impact of so-called lumpy assets on this relation.
Explain what factors determine a firm’s sustainable growth rate, discuss why it is of interest to management, and compute the sustainable growth rate for a firm.
Many executives tout the virtue of rapid corporate growth. After all, what could be more indicative of a successful business plan than the rapid expansion of sales and market share. Unfortunately, measuring success simply by a company’s growth ignores the careful planning that managers must undertake in order to continue to expand over the long term. Consider, for example, the meteoric rise and fall of Crumbs Bake Shop Inc., a bakery chain made famous by its one-of-a-kind cupcakes.

Crumbs opened its first store in the Upper West Side of Manhattan in 2003. Its expensive confections quickly became a big hit, with long lines of customers stretching outside the store, and it frequently sold out of its most popular variations. In response to the demand, Crumbs quickly started opening more shops in New York City and expanded to Philadelphia, Washington D.C., and Beverly Hills, among other cities. Just two years later, Crumbs was named as one of Inc. Magazine’s 500 fastest-growing companies in America. By 2010, Crumbs Bake Shop was generating sales of over $30 million annually, and planning was in the works for a 2011 initial public offering (IPO) of the company’s stock.

Once a baking novelty, cupcakes became hugely popular as Crumbs continued its growth. According to Newsweek, there were only three bakeries in the United States focused on cupcakes in 2003, but by 2011 there were hundreds. The increase in competition began to eat into Crumbs’ bottom line, and its stock price plunged over 70 percent just months after its 2011 IPO. Despite this setback, management pushed ahead with plans for growth. According to then CEO and co-founder Jason Bauer, the company would focus on remaining competitive through expansion, with plans to open as many as 200 stores by 2014. In addition, the company attempted to diversify its product offerings to include a wide range of beverage options, as well as a line of gourmet sandwiches.

Unfortunately, Crumbs’ business plan failed to pan out. With declining sales and margins, and a heavy debt and lease burden tied to its real estate obligations, the company found itself increasingly under financial pressure. In June of 2014, the cupcake bubble burst, and Crumbs’ management declared that without a significant influx of new capital the company would likely run out of funds for its operations. Just one month later, the company closed all of its stores and filed for bankruptcy. The rise and fall of Crumbs Bake Shop is just one example of how complicated it can be to manage a growing business. This chapter explains how managers plan for the future and carefully manage growth to create value for their stockholders and other stakeholders.

Chapter Preview
It is often said that a company that fails to plan for the future may have no future. In the short run, a firm may do well being opportunistic—reacting quickly to events as they unfold. To succeed over the long term, however, a firm must be innovative and must plan and employ a strategy that generates sustainable profits. Top executives spend a lot of time thinking about the types of investments the firm needs to make and how to finance them. The process that executives go through is called financial planning, and the result is called a financial plan.

This chapter focuses on long-term financial planning. We begin with a discussion of the firm’s strategic plan and its components. We then discuss the preparation of a financial plan. Next, we turn our attention to financial planning models used in the preparation of financial plans. These models generate projected financial statements that estimate the amount of external funding needed and identify other financial consequences of proposed strategic investments. We end the chapter by examining the relation between a firm’s growth and its need for external funding. Managing growth is an important topic, because growth without sufficient profits can lead to cash flow shortages and bankruptcy.

19.1 Financial Planning
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what a financial plan is and why financial planning is important.
Top management engages in long-term financial planning because experience has shown that having a well-articulated financial plan helps create value for stockholders. Planning is important for established businesses because it forces management to systematically think through the firm’s strategies, much as preparing a business plan helps an entreprenuer. Not surprisingly, lack of planning is a common reason for poor performance and bankruptcy. For example, the bankruptcy filing of Sur La Table in 2020 was attributed to a failure to plan and recognize changes in retail trends and consumer preferences. The kitchenware seller struggled to stay afloat as it lost market share to online retailers and consumers shifted away from at-home cooking.

The Planning Documents
When top management begins to prepare a company’s financial plan, it must answer four basic questions. First, where is the company headed? Second, what assets does it need to get there? Third, how is the firm going to pay for these assets? And, finally, does the firm have enough cash to pay its day-to-day bills as they come due?

These questions are answered in four important planning documents: (1) the strategic plan, which describes where the firm is headed and articulates the strategies that will be used to get it there; (2) the investment plan, which identifies the capital assets needed to execute the strategies; (3) the financing plan, which explains how the firm will raise the money to buy the assets; and (4) the cash budget, which determines whether the firm will have sufficient cash to pay its bills. These four planning documents provide the foundation for the firm’s financial plan, which consolidates the documents into a single scheme. Thus, the financial plan is a blueprint for the firm’s future.

Exhibit 19.1 shows the relations among the various plans and budgets. Notice that information from the strategic plan flows down to the financial plan, and information from the other plans and the cash budget flows up to the financial plan.

The Strategic Plan

Strategic planning is the most crucial planning step. The strategic plan sets out the vision for the firm—what management wants the firm to become—and establishes the strategies that managers will use to achieve their vision. Overall, the strategic plan provides high-level direction to management for making business decisions and guidance about what the firm will and will not do.

strategic planning the process by which management establishes the firm’s long-term goals, the strategies that will be used to achieve those goals, and the capabilities that are needed to sustain the firm’s competitive position

Preparing the strategic plan is the responsibility of top management, with the financial manager as a key participant and the board of directors as approver of the plan. The strategic plan covers all areas in the firm, such as operations, marketing, finance, information systems, and human resource management. The plan determines the lines of business in which the firm will compete and the relative emphasis placed on each business activity. It also identifies major areas for investments in productive assets: capital expenditures, the acquisition of another firm, or the launch of a new line of business. When deemed necessary, the plan also identifies mergers, alliances, and divestitures that management may seek to strengthen the firm’s business portfolio.

Building Intuition
A Firm’s Strategy Drives Its Business Decisions

The firm’s business strategy drives all of its decisions. It determines the firm’s lines of business, the products it will sell, its method of producing them, and the geographic markets in which it will compete. Thus, a company’s strategy defines its competitive position within its industry. To be successful, a firm must have a good strategy and a management team that can implement it. Management is always searching for a strategy that gives the firm a sustainable competitive edge.

EXHIBIT 19.1 The Financial Planning Process Various planning and budget documents flow into a financial plan and form its foundation. The completed financial plan articulates the firm’s strategic goals and identifies what types of investments the firm should make to achieve its goals, as well as how to finance those investments.


The Investment Plan

The investment plan, also known as the capital budget, lays out the firm’s proposed spending on capital assets for the year.1 The capital expenditures support the firm’s business strategy. Some capital expenditures pay for significant new additions, such as a new building, a new plant, or a new production line. Other capital expenditures are for more routine items, such as the replacement of old equipment and machinery. Once made, capital expenditures define a firm’s line of business for years to come. For example, Ford Motor Company could not suddenly start making tennis shoes instead of cars because Ford’s long-term assets hardly lend themselves to manufacturing shoes and the cost of conversion would be prohibitive. The preparation of the capital budget and the decision criteria for selecting capital projects are discussed in Chapters 10 through 13.

The Financing Plan

Once the capital budget is set, management must decide how to finance the assets. The simplest financing environment is one in which all capital projects are financed using internally generated funds. This means that the firm’s earnings, less cash used to pay dividends or repurchase stock, provide the necessary capital. However, only rarely does a firm finance all its projects in this way, as most firms have more capital projects than they can fund internally. Thus, management must seek external funding from a variety of sources, such as bank borrowing, selling of long-term debt, and issuance of additional equity. Overall, the goal of the financing plan is to determine how much external funding the firm needs.

The financing plan has three components. First, a financing plan states the dollar amount of external funding needed and identifies the sources of funds available to the firm. Second, the plan states management’s desired capital structure for the firm. This is important because it determines the relative amounts of debt and equity funds to be raised externally. Finally, the financing plan establishes the firm’s payout policy, which is relevant because it directly affects the amount of funds available for new investment projects. That is, the more funds the firm pays out as cash dividends or uses to repurchase stock, the more external capital the firm must raise if its internally generated funds are not sufficient to fund its investments. Capital structure policy is discussed in Chapter 16, and payout policy in Chapter 17.

An important point to note here is that the investment (capital budgeting) and financing decisions cannot be made independently—they must be considered together. The reason is that when management makes an investment decision, it must already have identified a source of funds to pay for the investment. This is no different from what you would do in your personal life. For example, you would not walk into a BMW dealership to buy a high-priced new car without having lined up a source of financing. Nor, for that matter, would the dealer sell you the car without having the financing already arranged. The investment decision (buy the car) and the financing decision (get an auto loan) are made simultaneously and hence are not independent.

Operating Unit (Divisional) Business Plans

Another component of the financial plan is made up of the business plans prepared by the various operating units or divisions within the firm. Each operating unit business plan describes what the unit will do to achieve the firm’s strategic goals. It also identifies the resources the unit needs and includes a detailed budget. It is here at the operating unit level that much of the firm’s budget work is done.

For example, assume that one of Ford Motor Company’s strategic goals is to manufacture and sell jet-skis through its marine division. The division has some idle capacity in one of its manufacturing plants. Thus, as part of the division’s business plan, it submits a capital budgeting request to enter the jet-ski market. (Of course, to be included in Ford’s capital budget, the jet-ski project must have an NPV greater than $0.)

Cash Budget

The cash budget for the firm is the aggregation (adding up) of the cash budgets from all of the operating units plus the cash budget for the corporate offices. The cash budget focuses exclusively on when the firm actually receives and pays out cash. The firm’s cash needs may vary weekly, monthly, and seasonally, as well as with predictable events such as payroll payments, payment of cash dividends, and debt retirements. If a shortfall of cash develops, the cash budget indicates the amount of money the firm needs to borrow and the anticipated borrowing cost.

As Exhibit 19.1 shows, the planning process drills down deep into the firm and gathers cash budget information on the myriad of activities that take place. If cash budgets are not well managed and monitored, serious cash shortages can occur. Tools used in cash management are discussed in Chapter 14, and the preparation of cash budgets is covered in Chapter 18.

Concluding Comments on Financial Planning
The principal benefit of financial planning is that it establishes financial and operating goals for the firm and communicates them throughout the organization. The financial plan also helps to align the actions of managers and their operating units with the firm’s strategic goals. Thus, the plan acts as a catalyst to get everyone in the firm moving in the same direction. To build support for the financial plan and energize people’s actions, top management should involve managers and other leaders in the firm at all levels in the planning process. An old axiom in management says that people support plans when they have had meaningful involvement in the plans’ preparation.

19.2 Financial Planning Models
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss how management uses financial planning models in the planning process, and explain the importance of sales forecasts in the construction of financial planning models.
Financial planning models are used to analyze how proposed investments and financing alternatives affect a firm’s financial statements. The models are usually run using spreadsheets, which helps trace investment, financing, and operating decisions through a company’s accounting system. While commercial planning models can be quite complex, most are built around the same basic concepts presented in this chapter.

In this section, we build a simple financial planning model to show how such models are constructed, how they work, and how their output is generated. Once you understand this model, you can easily step up to more advanced models.

The Sales Forecast
The sales forecast is the most important input for developing a financial planning model. Most firms generate their own sales forecasts. However, forecasting techniques vary widely, ranging from “seat-of-the-pants” forecasts—wherein the sales manager and key sales staff members talk it over and give their best estimate—to forecasts generated by complex statistical models. In addition, because the performance of the national and international economies have an effect on a company’s sales volume, most companies use economic forecasts as part of their sales forecasting process. Large companies often hire consulting firms that specialize in forecasting to help prepare sales forecasts under different scenarios. As you would expect, their services are quite expensive; economic forecasts can also be obtained from many regional banks at modest prices.

Building a Financial Planning Model
A financial planning model is no more than a series of equations that is used to generate projected financial statements for a company, such as an income statement or a balance sheet. The three basic components of a financial planning model, shown in Exhibit 19.2, are (1) inputs to the model, (2) the model itself, and (3) outputs from the model—the projected financial statements. Let’s discuss each component in turn.

Inputs to the Model

As shown in the exhibit, important inputs to the financial planning model include current financial statements, sales forecasts, and investment and financial policy decisions.

Current Financial Statements
The starting point for constructing a financial planning model is the firm’s current income statement and balance sheet. These statements serve as a baseline for forecasts.

Sales Forecasts
For most financial planning models, the principal input variable is a forecast of the firm’s sales or sales growth rate. The sales forecast is the key driver in financial models because so many items on the income statement and balance sheet vary with changes in the level of sales. For example, if sales increase, it stands to reason that the firm will use more labor and raw materials. Higher sales may also require additional investments in capital assets.

Sales forecasts are given for some time period, such as a quarter or a year, and are often expressed as a percent change in sales:

(19.1)
where:

%ΔS = percent change in net sales

     St = level of net sales in period t

St+1 = level of net sales in period t + 1

Sales are calculated as the number of units sold multiplied by the price at which they are sold. For an example of how Equation 19.1 is used, if the current year’s sales (St) are $100 million and the forecasted sales for next year (St+1) are $120 million, applying Equation 19.1 yields the percent growth in sales over the coming year:

EXHIBIT 19.2 The Components of a Financial Planning Model We can categorize the parts of a financial planning model as inputs, the model itself, and outputs. Models allow management to generate projected financial statements that enable them to see the financial impact of strategic initiatives.


Investment and Financial Policy Decisions
Preparing a financial planning model requires top management to make a number of investment and financial policy decisions. These decisions impose constraints on the financial model’s outputs and so they must be considered carefully. Some important investment and financial policy decisions are:

Investment policy decisions: Identify the investment decisions to be evaluated as part of the financial planning process. Typically, these are large capital expenditures such as building a new manufacturing facility, entering a new line of business, or acquiring another firm.
Financial policy decisions:
- Capital structure decision: Determines management’s targeted capital structure—its willingness to use financial leverage.
- Financing decision: Determines the acceptable type of financing—retained earnings, equity, preferred stock, and/or long-term debt.
- Payout decision: Identifies the firm’s dividend and stock repurchase policies for the sales period.
The Financial Planning Model

A financial planning model is a set of equations that generate projected financial statements. Along with the sales forecast and the investment and financial policy decisions, management must specify key assumptions regarding how the income statement and the balance sheet accounts vary with sales. For example, suppose that, based on historical data, a company finds that cost of goods sold is 80 percent of sales and inventory and accounts receivables are each 15 percent of sales. In such a case, it might be reasonable to assume that these relations will hold for the projected income statement and balance sheet. Thus, if sales are projected to be $100 million next year, the projected cost of goods sold will be $80 million ($100 million × 0.80 = $80 million), and inventory and accounts receivable will both be $15 million ($100 million × 0.15 = $15 million). This model, along with the other planning models presented in this chapter, is a percent of sales model, in which most of the variables vary directly with the level of sales.

percent of sales model a financial planning model that assumes that most income statement and balance sheet accounts vary proportionally with sales

Learning by Doing Application 19.1, at the top of the next page, illustrates how next year’s accounts receivable and inventory can be calculated as a percent of sales.

Outputs from the Model: Projected Financial Statements

The outputs from the financial planning model are projected financial statements called pro forma financial statements. In finance and accounting, the term pro forma means forecasted or projected.2 The statements produced by a financial planning model are forecasted based on the inputs and assumptions entered into the model. In addition to pro forma financial statements, planning models usually generate a set of financial ratios similar to those discussed in Chapter 4 and include features that enable management to prepare a cash budget.

pro forma financial statements projected financial statements that reflect a set of assumptions concerning investment, financing, and operating decisions

A Simple Planning Model
Let’s work through a simple percent of sales example to see how a financial planning model generates pro forma financial statements and is used to analyze a strategic investment.3 Keep in mind that more sophisticated planning models are built around the same basic concepts—there are just more assumptions to deal with. The important point here is to make sure you understand how the model is built around a set of assumptions and how it generates the pro forma financial statements.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 19.1
Financial Statement Items Often Vary with Sales

Problem

You have the following information: (1) sales this year are $50 million; (2) sales are expected to grow by 20 percent next year; and (3) for the current year, accounts receivable are 7 percent of sales and inventory is 10 percent of sales. Your boss has asked you to estimate next year’s sales, accounts receivable, and inventory.





Generating Pro Forma Statements

Sleepy Hollow Corporation’s financial statements for the year that just ended are shown in simplified form in the following table:

Sleepy Hollow Corporation Current Financial Statements ($ millions)
Income Statement	Balance Sheet
Net sales	$1,000	  Assets	$600	Debt	$400
Costs	     700		         	   Equity	  200
Net income	$   300	Total	$600	Total	$600
Sleepy Hollow’s management expects sales to increase by 15 percent for the coming year. Assume that the financial statement accounts vary directly with changes in sales and that management has no financing plan at this time. Given this information, we can make the following calculations:

We now have the sales and cost figures for the firm’s pro forma income statement:

Sleepy Hollow Corporation Pro Forma Income Statement ($ millions)
Net sales	$1,150
Costs	    805
Net income	$  345
Thus, the firm’s projected net income is $345 million.

Turning to the balance sheet, since we are assuming that all financial statement items vary with the change in sales, the projected values for the balance sheet accounts are:

and the resulting pro forma balance sheet is:

Sleepy Hollow Corporation Pro Forma Balance Sheet ($ millions)
Assets	$690  ($90)	Debt	$460  ($60)
   Equity	230   ( 30)
Total	$690  ($90)	Total	$690  ($90)
The numbers in parentheses are the changes between the current and projected dollar amounts. Notice that all the balance sheet figures have increased by 15 percent and that the balance sheet balances. This is because both the sources and the use of funds have increased by 15 percent. The $90 million in new assets is being financed by $30 million from retained earnings (internal financing) and $60 million from new long-term debt (external funding).

The balance sheet balances, but if you look back at the income statement, you may notice that the equity account does not look right. Recall that Sleepy Hollow’s projected net income was $345 million. Adding this amount to the initial equity account balance of $200 million would result in a final equity balance of $545 million ($345 million + $200 million = $545 million). As you can see, the equity balance in the pro forma balance sheet is $230 million. Why the apparent conflict?

As a general rule, whenever account balances differ or there is some confusion about an account, the easiest way to determine what is going on is to reconcile the account. For the equity account, if the firm is not expected to sell new stock, there are two basic things that could take place during the year: (1) the firm could generate income that is added to retained earnings and (2) management could distribute value to stockholders by paying a cash dividend, repurchasing stock, or doing a combination of both. Dividends will be subtracted from retained earnings, and stock repurchases will be reflected in the treasury share account. Since the pro forma equity balance is lower than the sum of the initial equity account balance plus Sleepy Hollow’s net income, the forecasts assume the firm will pay a dividend, repurchase stock, or do a combination of both. We can calculate how large this dividend or repurchase will be as follows:

Beginning equity balance	=	$200 million
+ Net income	=	345 million
− Dividend/repurchase	=	    X
Ending equity balance	=	$230 million
Solving for X, we find that:

The reconciliation makes the dividend or repurchase transaction transparent. It is clear that with a net income of $345 million and the constraint that the ending equity balance is $230 million, the firm must pay a $315 million cash dividend, repurchase $315 million of shares, or distribute $315 million through a combination of a dividend and a stock repurchase.

Evaluating an Investment Opportunity

Now let’s suppose that, as part of its investment policy, Sleepy Hollow is considering building a new manufacturing plant. The project is estimated to cost $200 million and is to be financed entirely with debt. As in the prior example, sales are expected to increase by 15 percent for the year, and the plant will be placed in service the following year. Finally, assume that all financial statement accounts vary directly with changes in sales and that the current payout policy is to pay a $315 million cash dividend.

To determine whether the project is feasible as planned, management needs to prepare a set of pro forma financial statements that includes the cost of the new facility. Sleepy Hollow’s pro forma income statement will not change because of the building project. Thus, we can use Sleepy Hollow’s income statement shown earlier. The preliminary pro forma balance sheet for the project, which excludes external funding, is as follows:

Sleepy Hollow’s Building Project Preliminary Pro Forma Balance Sheet ($ millions)
Assets	$690  ($90)	Debt	$400
New facility	  200  (200)	Equity	  230  (30)
Total	$890          	Total	$630          
We can see that total assets are $890 million, composed of the $690 million ($600 million × 1.15 = $690 million) we calculated earlier plus $200 million for the new facility. The value of the equity account remains unchanged at $230 million ($200 million × 1.15 = $230 million), because it is subject to the 15 percent growth limit, and management must pay the $315 million cash dividend. Since we do not know the amount of debt needed, we enter debt at the current balance sheet amount of $400 million.

Now, comparing the totals, we see that the balance sheet does not balance: total assets are $890 million, while total debt and equity equals $630 million. The difference between the two numbers is $260 million ($890 million − $630 million = $260 million). This “plug value” is the amount of external funding needed (EFN) by the firm. EFN is the additional debt or equity a firm needs to issue so that it can meet its total funding requirements. In this analysis, we refer to EFN as the plug value because it is the number we have to plug into the balance sheet to get it to balance. In our example, the firm must issue $260 million of debt because, as you recall, management made a decision to finance the new project entirely with debt.

external funding needed (EFN) the additional debt or equity a firm must raise from external sources to meet its total funding requirements

The final balance sheet, which includes the building project, is shown in the following table. Overall, the firm is financing $290 million of new assets: $200 million for the new facility and $90 million for new assets to support the increase in sales expected next year. The funding is a combination of internal and external funding, which totals $290 million: $260 million in debt (external) and $30 million in addition to retained earnings (internal). The firm is also able to pay the required $315 million of cash dividends. If the firm can borrow the $260 million at a reasonable rate, it will be able to generate sufficient funds to finance the $200 million capital project and pay the required cash dividend of $315 million. The choice between future debt and equity financing is an important element of the financial policy decisions needed as inputs into a financial planning model.

Assets	$690 ($90)	Debt	$660 ($260)

19.3 A Better Financial Planning Model
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss how the relation between projected sales and the income statement and balance sheet accounts can be determined, and analyze a strategic investment decision using a percent of sales model.
The preceding section presented a simple financial planning model that assumes all income and balance sheet accounts vary directly with sales. Although that assumption is helpful to simplify calculations, it does not reflect what happens in the real world. We now relax our assumptions so that our model is more realistic and generates more accurate forecasts. We assume that all working capital accounts—current assets and liabilities—vary directly with sales. For other accounts in the financial statements, independent forecasts may be required, or values may be set by management based on other criteria. To illustrate the process, we will work through an example.

The Blackwell Sales Company
The Blackwell Sales Company is a small, privately owned company located in College Station, Texas. The firm serves the oil and gas exploration industry in Texas and the adjoining states. It sells and does light manufacturing of rigging equipment for oil and gas exploration. The firm’s management owns 75 percent of the stock, with the balance owned by friends and outside investors. Blackwell’s management is projecting a banner year, as sales are expected to increase 30 percent with an improvement in the overall economy. Because of the high-risk nature of the business, management is very conservative with respect to any action that might materially increase the firm’s risk. Some of the management team is concerned about the risk associated with increasing sales by 30 percent in a one-year period.

The financial manager looks at the firm’s financial statements and provides the following information:

Net sales during the fiscal year that just ended were $2 million.
Historical financial data indicate that the total cost of producing the firm’s services and products averages 85 percent of sales.
The firm’s average tax rate is 34.1 percent and is not expected to change.
The firm’s payout policy is to pay 33.5 percent of earnings as cash dividends.
EXHIBIT 19.3 Blackwell Sales: Current and Pro Forma Income Statements ($ thousands)

The pro forma income statement for Blackwell Sales assumes that the income statement items vary directly with sales.

    Dividends	$      66	$      86	Dividend policy: 33.5% of net income
    Addition to retained earnings	$   132	$   171	
The Income Statement
Exhibit 19.3 shows the firm’s current (most recent) and pro forma income statements. Let’s look at the calculations used to arrive at the pro forma income statement. Management expects sales to increase by 30 percent next year, and so projected sales are $2 million × 1.30 = $2.6 million. Since total costs have averaged 85 percent of sales, projected total costs are $2.6 million × 0.85 = $2.21 million. Projected taxes, which are 34.1 percent of taxable income, are 0.341 × $390,000 = $132,990, which we will round to $133,000 for simplicity. Subtracting taxes from taxable income, we arrive at the firm’s projected net income of $257,000.

Blackwell’s cash dividend is $86,000 (0.335 × $257,000 = $86,095, which we will round to $86,000), and the remaining $171,000 of net income (0.665 × $257,000 = $170,905) is retained in the firm as an addition to retained earnings.

These amounts relate to two ratios we will use in this chapter: the dividend payout ratio and the retention ratio, or plowback ratio. The formulas and calculations for Blackwell are as follows:

(19.2)
(19.3)
dividend payout ratio the proportion of net income paid out (distributed) as dividends

retention (plowback) ratio the proportion of net income retained in the firm

The dividend payout ratio shows the percentage of the firm’s earnings paid out as cash dividends to stockholders. Similarly, the retention ratio tells what percentage of the firm’s earnings is retained in the firm. Generally speaking, smaller, fast-growing companies plow back all or most of their earnings into the business, whereas more established firms with slower growth rates and larger cash flows distribute more of their profits to stockholders. Notice that the sum of the retention ratio and the dividend payout ratio equals 1.000 (0.335 + 0.665 = 1.000). This is because every dollar of net income is either paid out as a cash dividend or retained in the firm.

The Balance Sheet
To generate a pro forma balance sheet, we start with the current balance sheet, as shown in Exhibit 19.4. For each account that varies directly with sales, the exhibit gives the relation as a percent of sales for the current year. Notice that these percentages differ among the accounts. How do we determine which accounts vary with sales, and how do we know the relevant percentages? Fortunately, the process is straightforward.

EXHIBIT 19.4 Blackwell Sales: Current Balance Sheet ($ thousands)

In this balance sheet for Blackwell Sales, many accounts vary directly with sales. The projected percent of sales is shown for each of these accounts. The accounts labeled “n/a” do not change proportionately with sales.

Total assets	$1,000	  50%		stockholders’ equity	$1,000	50%
Historical Trends

We begin by looking at balance sheet accounts that might vary with sales. To do this, we gather four or five years of historical accounting data and express those data as a percent of sales. A trend may be self-evident, or some simple trend lines can be fit to the data to identify trends. In either case, this process allows the financial manager to decide which financial accounts can safely be estimated as a percent of sales and which must be forecast using other information.

The following table shows several years of historical data from Blackwell’s balance sheet accounts, and the far-right column contains the final forecast values for 2022. We now discuss the rationale for assigning a percent of sales figure to each balance sheet account. We look first at the working capital accounts: cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.

Percent of Sales
2018	2019	2020	2021	Forecast 2022
Cash	    5%	    5%	    4%	    5%	    5%
Accounts receivable	10	9	9	9	6
Inventory	7	8	7	6	7
Accounts payable	4	4	4	3	4
Net fixed assets	30	32	34	32	32
Working Capital Accounts

The key working capital accounts tend to vary directly with sales. Take inventory as an example. As sales increase, the firm needs to increase the level of inventory proportionately to support the higher sales level. The historical data in the table support this view. Inventory levels have been a relatively constant percentage of sales, varying from 6 to 8 percent. In selecting the appropriate percentage for the planning process, management must consider what the firm’s optimal inventory ratio is. On the one hand, as discussed in Chapter 14, management would like to minimize inventory levels, because inventory is expensive to finance. On the other hand, if inventory levels become too low, the firm may lose sales because of stockouts, which occur when an order comes in and there is no product to sell. Let’s assume that Blackwell’s management determines that 7 percent of projected sales is the right inventory-to-sales ratio for the firm.

The ratio of accounts receivable to sales has been 9 percent for the last several years. However, firms with similar credit policies operate with a receivables-to-sales ratio of 6 percent. As sales have increased, Blackwell has provided proportionately more credit to its customers. To improve the firm’s performance to industry standards, management decides to collect receivables more aggressively and targets a ratio of 6 percent. Management has also targeted cash accounts totaling 5 percent of sales. Management believes that a 5 percent cash ratio provides adequate liquidity to fund ongoing operations and pay for unexpected emergencies yet does not tie up an excessive amount of cash in low-yielding assets.

On the liability side, the firm’s historical data show that accounts payable vary with sales. This seems reasonable, since the greater a firm’s sales, the more orders the firm will have to place with its suppliers. Management is satisfied with the firm’s vendor relationships and the payment schedule for vendors. Hence, accounts payable are forecast to be 4 percent of sales.

Fixed Assets

We assume that the company’s net fixed assets vary with the level of sales. An examination of historical data confirms that this is a reasonable assumption. Blackwell’s management decides to use the firm’s four-year historical average—32 percent—for the projected ratio of fixed assets to sales. Thus, for every $100 in sales, the firm needs $32 of fixed assets to support the sales.

We should note that such a relation between fixed assets and sales may not always hold. The reason is that fixed assets may vary directly with sales only when a firm is operating at full capacity and fixed assets can be added in small increments. For example, if a firm has a large amount of unused capacity, its sales could increase by 20 percent without adding any new fixed assets. We will come back to this issue in more detail later in the chapter. For Blackwell, the data support the proportional fixed assets-to-sales ratio, so we can proceed on that basis.

As a final comment, notice in Exhibit 19.4 on the asset side of the balance sheet that the total percent of sales for asset items adds up to 50 percent. This means that total assets are 50 percent of sales. The ratio of total assets to sales is called the capital intensity ratio and is calculated for Blackwell Sales as follows:

(19.4)
The capital intensity ratio, which is the inverse of the total asset turnover ratio discussed in Chapter 4 (Equation 4.7), tells us something about the amount of assets the firm needs to generate $1 in sales. The higher the ratio, the more capital the firm needs to generate sales—that is, the more capital intensive the firm. Firms that are capital intensive tend to be more risky than similar firms that use less fixed assets. High capital intensity is generally associated with high fixed assets and correspondingly high fixed costs. If there is a downturn in sales, profits decrease sharply for firms with high fixed costs because fixed costs cannot be reduced in the short term. This is the operating leverage concept that is illustrated in Exhibit 16.3 in Chapter 16. With a 50 percent capital intensity ratio, Blackwell Sales is not a highly capital-intensive firm. Examples of capital-intensive industries are the airline and the automobile industries; for example, both United Airlines and Ford Motor Company have capital intensity ratios greater than 100 percent.

Liabilities and Equity

For most firms, the remaining liability accounts on the balance sheet do not vary with sales. Their values typically change because of management decisions, such as the decision to pay off a loan or issue debt. Thus, each liability and equity account must be evaluated separately.

Turning to individual accounts, notes payable typically represent short-term borrowing. This account value will only change with some decision by Blackwell’s management, such as making a payment on a note or borrowing more money from a bank. Thus, the account’s value does not vary with sales, as indicated by the “n/a,” or “not applicable,” in Exhibit 19.4. Similarly, the account value for long-term debt changes only when management decides to issue or retire debt. The same argument holds for the common stock account, which changes only when management decides to sell or repurchase common shares. The last account is retained earnings. Retained earnings may or may not vary directly with sales. The reason for the ambiguity is that the amount of funds in retained earnings depends not only on the firm’s earnings but also on the firm’s payout policy, which is set by management. Thus, for now, both the common stock and the retained earnings accounts are entered as n/a in Exhibit 19.4.

The Preliminary Pro Forma Balance Sheet
We are now in a position to construct a preliminary pro forma balance sheet, as shown in Exhibit 19.5. The preliminary pro forma balance sheet is a first approximation in deciding how the firm should fund the assets it needs to support an increase in sales of 30 percent. Once it is constructed, management can develop a suitable financing plan.

To construct the preliminary pro forma balance sheet, we follow these steps:

We first calculate the projected values for all the accounts that vary with sales, and we enter these values into the preliminary pro forma balance sheet.
We then compute and enter the projected value of any other balance sheet accounts for which an end-of-period value can be forecast or otherwise determined.
For all the accounts for which end-of-period values cannot be forecast or otherwise determined, we enter the current year’s value.
Typically, the balance sheet will not balance at this point. We thus compute the plug value, which balances the balance sheet. The plug value will involve the accounts marked “n/a” in the initial balance sheet (Exhibit 19.4). We must analyze these accounts in light of the firm’s capital structure and dividend policies. The plug value is usually the amount of external funding needed (EFN), because we are usually adding new assets to the balance sheet to support growth; thus, total assets exceed total liabilities plus equity.

Let’s work through each step using numbers from the Blackwell case.

Step One. We calculate the projected balance sheet values for the accounts that vary with sales as follows (projected sales are $2.6 million):

Cash is projected to be 5 percent of sales: $2.6 million × 0.05 = $130,000.
Accounts receivable is projected to be 6 percent of sales: $2.6 million × 0.06 = $156,000.
EXHIBIT 19.5 Blackwell Sales: Preliminary Pro Forma Balance Sheet ($ thousands)

This preliminary pro forma balance sheet for Blackwell Sales is a first approximation in deciding how to fund anticipated growth. At this stage of the analysis, the balance sheet will not balance (Total Assets will not equal Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity), and the difference will be the plug value, which is usually the amount of external funding the firm will need in order to fund investments and operations.

Assets		Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity
Projected	Change			Projected	Change
Current assets				Current liabilities		
    Cash	$ 130	$ 30		    Accounts payable	$ 104	$ 44
    Accounts receivable	    156	    36		    Notes payable	 140	  0
    Inventory	 182	 42		        Total	$ 244	$ 44
        Total	$ 468	$ 108		Long-term debt	$ 200	$ 0
Owner’s equity		
    Common stock	$ 10	$ 0
    Retained earnings	 761	 171
        Total equity	$ 771	$171
Net fixed assets	 832	 192		Total liabilities and		
Total assets	$1,300	$300		    stockholders’ equity	$1,215	$215
External funding needed (EFN)	$ 85	
Inventory is projected to be 7 percent of sales: $2.6 million × 0.07 = $182,000.
Net fixed assets are projected to be 32 percent of sales: $2.6 million × 0.32 = $832,000.
Accounts payable are projected to be 4 percent of sales: $2.6 million × 0.04 = $104,000.
These values, along with the differences between the current and forecast amounts, are shown in Exhibit 19.5.

Step Two. We now consider the balance sheet accounts that do not vary with sales. We can determine the value of retained earnings, since the firm has a policy of paying out 33.5 percent of earnings as dividends. Recall from our earlier discussion that projected net income is $257,000 and the proportion of that amount going to retained earnings is $171,000 (0.665 × $257,000 = $171,000). Thus, the end-of-year account balance is $761,000 ($590,000 + $171,000 = $761,000), where $590,000 is the current retained earnings balance.

Step Three. The remaining accounts that do not vary with sales represent sources of financing for the firm: notes payable, long-term debt, and common stock. These accounts are entered into the preliminary pro forma balance sheet at their current values, as shown in Exhibit 19.5.

Step Four. As predicted, the preliminary pro forma balance sheet does not balance at this point: projected assets total $1.3 million, and projected sources of funding (debt and equity) total $1.215 million. The difference between these two values is our plug value. The plug value represents EFN, which is $85,000 ($1.3 million − $1.215 million = $85,000). Since we are dealing with a financing decision, all accounts with the n/a designation in Exhibit 19.4 represent possible financing options. Management must use its judgment and its knowledge of Blackwell Sales to select the appropriate financing for the firm.

What the Findings Mean

What does all the information in Exhibit 19.5 tell management? First, if sales increase as projected, the firm’s total assets will expand by $300,000. Of that $300,000 increase, $108,000 will go to increase current assets and $192,000 will go to increase the firm’s fixed assets.

Second, the $300,000 in additional assets could be financed as follows: $171,000 from internally generated funds (the addition to retained earnings), $44,000 from expanded trade credit (the increase in accounts payable), and $85,000 of external funding from the sale of debt or equity or both.

Management’s Decision

How should Blackwell Sales fund the $300,000 to support the 30 percent increase in sales? The firm could issue debt or equity, or it could reduce dividends. Alternatively, the firm could rethink its strategy and scale back the 30 percent targeted growth figure. Suppose Blackwell’s management team meets to discuss the findings from Exhibit 19.5. After much discussion, the team reaches a consensus on the following points:

The firm has a unique opportunity to ride a strong market for oil and gas development and wants to pursue the 30 percent sales growth targeted.
Management would like to avoid issuing more debt because of the volatility of the oil and gas exploration business.
Management prefers not to issue more common stock for fear of diluting earnings.
Management would like to pay an annual dividend but only if the first three points are adequately addressed.
What does management do? In the end, management decides to pay no cash dividend to stockholders for the coming year. Thus, the $300,000 increase in assets is funded entirely from earnings. This decision is made to avoid the risks associated with additional debt and the dilution of earnings that would result from issuing additional common stock.

EXHIBIT 19.6 Blackwell Sales: Final Pro Forma Balance Sheet ($ thousands)

The final pro forma balance sheet reflects Blackwell management’s decision to temporarily suspend dividends and fund its growth with internal funds (retained earnings). Although financial models can determine the amount of EFN needed, management must make the final decision about how to fund the firm’s capital requirements.

Assets	Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity
Projected	Change		Projected	Change
Current assets			Current liabilities		
Cash	$ 130	$ 30	Accounts payable	$ 104	$ 44

Total assets	$1,300	$300	stockholders’ equity	$1,300	$300
External funding needed (EFN)	$ 0	    
The Final Pro Forma Balance Sheet
Exhibit 19.6 shows the final pro forma balance sheet reflecting the decision to temporarily suspend dividends and fund the expansion with internal funds (retained earnings). As you recall, Blackwell’s net income is $257,000; and thus, the retained earnings account is increased by $257,000, making the final balance $847,000 ($590,000 + $257,000 = $847,000). Since the proposed dividend of $86,000 now goes entirely into retained earnings, a source of funds, and the firm’s additional financing needs are $85,000, there is $1,000 ($86,000 − $85,000 = $1,000) available to reduce debt. The most likely course of action is to reduce notes payable by $1,000, making notes payable $139,000 rather than $140,000.4

Finally, it is important to note that financial models do not make decisions; only the firm’s management can do that. Financial models can only generate numbers given the inputs and assumption made when constructing the model. Once constructed, financial models can help management evaluate strategic alternatives, assess their financial impact on the firm, and determine whether they are consistent with the firm’s financial policies. In the Blackwell case, management suspended its dividend policy.

Learning by Doing Application 19.2 illustrates how restoring the dividend, but paying a smaller amount, would affect the Blackwell retained earnings account.

Problem

Let’s continue the Blackwell Sales example. Suppose that Blackwell’s management now decides to pay a cash dividend, but to reduce the payout to 10 percent of net income. Reconcile Blackwell’s retained earnings account.

19.4 Beyond the Basic Planning Models
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe the conditions under which fixed assets vary directly with sales, and discuss the impact of so-called lumpy assets on this relation.
In this section, we tie up some important loose ends concerning financial planning models. We first consider some shortcomings of the simple models we have been discussing and describe how more sophisticated models address those shortcomings. We then discuss additional benefits of financial planning.

Improving Financial Planning Models
Much of the discussion concerning the planning models developed in this chapter focuses on the underlying process for generating pro forma statements. Our goal is to have you understand how planning models work so that when you move to more complex spreadsheet models, you will be an informed user capable of understanding their limitations and strengths. We now discuss some of the improvements you will find incorporated in more sophisticated models.

Interest Expense

One omission from the models presented in this chapter is that they fail to account for interest expense in the financial statements. A problem we face in modeling is that interest expense cannot be estimated accurately until the cost and amount of borrowing have been determined, and the cost of borrowing depends in part on the amount of borrowing. Since interest expense is a pre-tax expense, the use of additional debt will result in lower net income and retained earnings, and reduce the forecast value of owner’s equity. This in turn will create a need for additional incremental pro forma financing. Thus, we cannot accurately estimate the level of debt financing without knowing the interest expense. More sophisticated financial models estimate interest payments and borrowings simultaneously.

EXHIBIT 19.7 Relation between Inventory Levels and Changes in Sales This graph shows inventory-to-sales ratios for two situations: one in which inventory varies directly with sales (black line) and one in which it does not (red line). Financial managers know from experience that most working capital accounts, such as inventory, do not increase directly with sales. Instead, they increase at a decreasing rate as sales increase.


Working Capital Accounts

Another weakness in our percent of sales model is the assumption that working capital increases proportionally with sales. Seasoned financial managers know that increases in some working capital accounts are not proportional to sales; this is particularly true for cash balances and inventory. Exhibit 19.7, for example, shows the inventory-to-sales ratios for two situations: one where inventory varies directly with sales and one where it does not. The black line illustrates the assumption that changes in inventory vary in proportion to changes in sales. Notice that inventory gets very small as sales approach zero. When inventory varies in proportion to sales, the inventory/sales ratio is 50 percent, regardless of the level of sales. The red line illustrates a different relation. Here, at sales of $300,000, the inventory/sales ratio is 70 percent ($210,000/$300,000 = 0.70, or 70 percent), and at sales of $500,000, it declines to 50 percent ($250,000/$500,000 = 0.50, or 50 percent). The important point here is not the ratio calculations but the fact that working capital does not increase directly with sales. Instead, it increases at a decreasing rate as sales increase. This is a common relation between inventory and sales and between cash and sales.

Fixed Assets

Another issue concerns the way we handled fixed assets. Specifically, we assumed that when sales increase, fixed assets are added in small increments, which implies that production facilities are always operating near or at full capacity. This is not typically the case. In most instances, fixed assets are added as large discrete units, and much of a firm’s capacity may not be utilized for some period of time. These types of assets are often called lumpy assets. Let’s look at an example.

lumpy assets fixed assets added as large, discrete units; these assets may not be used to full capacity for some time, leaving the company with excess capacity

Suppose you and a group of investors decide to enter the market for frozen Mexican snack foods, which you believe is a growing market. You buy a small food-manufacturing facility for $100,000 that can easily be converted to manufacture the snack foods. Exhibit 19.8 illustrates your initial situation. After you make the purchase, your sales are zero, and you have $100,000 in fixed assets, which will support sales of up to $150,000. Thus, the facility has $150,000 in excess capacity.

Over time, sales expand to $75,000. At this level, no additional assets are needed (Point A in the exhibit) because the firm still has excess capacity of $75,000 ($150,000 − $75,000 = $75,000). When the firm’s sales expand to $150,000 (Point B), however, the firm no longer has idle capacity. You determine that a $200,000 addition to fixed assets is the most economical way to gain additional capacity. If you make this investment, the firm will have $300,000 ($100,000 + $200,000 = $300,000) in fixed assets, which will support sales up to $400,000. Notice that when your firm is at Point B, the threshold point, even a small increase in sales results in more than doubling the firm’s fixed assets.

EXHIBIT 19.8 Fixed Assets Are Usually Acquired in Large, Discrete Units In real-world situations, fixed assets usually do not vary directly with sales, as we assumed with our simplified financial models. Management often adds fixed assets in very large increments in order to add capacity in the most economical way.


In financial planning, management must account for the fact that investments in fixed assets often come in very large increments, or lumps. Furthermore, a significant amount of lead time is often required to bring them on line. Thus, as a firm nears full manufacturing capacity, management should begin planning to acquire additional fixed assets in the future. In contrast, if a firm has considerable excess capacity, sales growth will not require additional fixed assets.

19.5 Managing and Financing Growth
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain what factors determine a firm’s sustainable growth rate, discuss why it is of interest to management, and compute the sustainable growth rate for a firm.
We close the chapter with a discussion of how a business can grow and the need to manage growth. When companies add assets through acquisition or the capital budgeting process, they grow in size. If the rate of growth is rapid, much of the asset expansion will likely require external funding. Rapid growth is often a goal of management because it helps a company gain market share quickly and strengthens its competitive position in the marketplace. In addition, managers of companies with high growth rates often receive accolades and recognition from investors and their peers for their business acumen. Overall, rapid growth is considered a desirable achievement.

Rapid growth can have a dark side, however. As a firm grows rapidly, management might finance the growth with long-term debt in a way that increases the firm’s overall financial leverage. Higher financial leverage increases the probability that a firm will face financial distress if business conditions deteriorate. If management is using a lot of debt financing and sales then unexpectedly plunge, causing cash flows to decline, the firm may not have enough cash to pay long-term debt holders and other creditors.

How does rapid growth cause businesses to fail? The introduction to this chapter, which features Crumbs Bake Shop, provides a great example of what can go wrong. The classic formula for business failure is rapid expansion, a lack of solid long-term planning, and an insufficient equity base or, put another way, the use of too much financial leverage.

External Funding Needed
When a firm expands rapidly, its operations might not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet all of its financial obligations. If this happens, management must look for outside funding—debt or equity. We now explore the factors affecting management’s decision to seek external funding. We do so by developing some relations between a firm’s growth rate and the amount of external funding needed (EFN).

Growth and External Funding

The best way to understand the relation between growth and external funding is in the context of a rapidly growing firm and its financial statements. The firm we use is called Empire Enterprises, which is a hypothetical real estate investment firm located in New York City that engages in real estate development and property management. Empire is a public company whose stock is listed on the NYSE.

Exhibit 19.9 shows the current income statement and balance sheet for Empire Enterprises. Last year, Empire had total assets of $50 million and book equity of $30 million, and it generated $10 million of earnings on $100 million in sales. Empire’s management team believes the firm can increase sales by 20 percent for the coming year. All costs and assets are assumed to grow at the same rate as sales, 60 percent of earnings are paid as cash dividends, and the board of directors is reluctant to issue additional common stock.

EXHIBIT 19.10 Empire Enterprises: Pro Forma Income Statement and Balance Sheet ($ millions)

The pro forma balance sheet for Empire Enterprises does not balance, and the difference is the amount of EFN. Because the company’s board does not wish to issue common stock, the funding will have to take the form of long-term debt.

Income Statement (Pro Forma)
Net sales	$120.0
Costs	 180.0
Net income	$ 12.0
Dividends	$ 7.2
Addition to retained earnings	$ 4.8
Balance Sheet (Pro Forma)
Assets	Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity
Projected	Change		Projected	Change
Assets	$60.0	$10.0	Total debt	$20.0	$0.0
Equity	 34.8	4.8
Total assets	$60.0	$10.0	Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity	$54.8	$4.8
External funding needed (EFN)	$ 5.2	
Given this information, we can prepare the pro forma income statement and balance sheet for Empire Enterprises, which appear in Exhibit 19.10. The income statement shows both sales and costs increasing by 20 percent for the year: projected sales are $120 million ($100 million × 1.20 = $120 million), projected costs are $108 million ($90 million × 1.20 = $108 million), and thus, the firm’s projected net income is $12 million ($120 million − $108 million = $12 million).

Turning to the pro forma balance sheet, we see that the projected total assets for the firm are $60 million ($50 million × 1.20 = $60 million) indicating an investment in assets of $10 million. For the moment, we hold total debt constant at $20 million so that we can compute the EFN needed to support the 20 percent increase in sales. The firm’s payout policy calls for 40 percent of earnings to be retained in the firm, since 60 percent will be paid to stockholders as a dividend. Thus, given net income of $12 million, the addition to retained earnings is $4.8 million (0.40 × $12 million = $4.8 million). The equity account is increased to $34.8 million ($30.0 million + $4.8 million = $34.8 million).

After these changes have been made, the pro forma balance sheet does not balance. Total assets equal $60.0 million, and total liabilities and equity equal $54.8 million. The difference, $5.2 million ($60.0 million − $54.8 million = $5.2 million), is the EFN. The $10 million investment in assets is being financed from two sources: $4.8 million from the addition to retained earnings and $5.2 million from external funding ($4.8 million + $5.2 million = $10 million). The EFN could be either debt or equity, but in Empire’s case it will be long-term debt, since Empire’s board is reluctant to issue equity.

So far, we have calculated EFN exactly as we did in the previous sections. However, we are now going to build a mathematical model to calculate EFN. The model will allow us to better understand the relation between a firm’s growth ambitions and the amount of EFN.

A Mathematical Model

Looking at the pro forma balance sheet calculations for Empire Enterprises (Exhibit 19.10), we can see that new investments are determined by the firm’s total assets and projected growth in sales:

For Empire, the calculation is $10 million = 0.20 × $50 million. Note that to calculate new investments, we multiply the firm’s initial total assets by the expected growth rate in sales forecasted by management. The new investments are the capital expenditures and the increase in working capital necessary to sustain the increase in sales.

Conceptually, the new investments are funded first by internally generated funds, which come from earnings retained in the firm. Once those funds are exhausted, the remainder of new investments must be financed externally by the sale of debt or equity, or some combination of both. Thus, the amount of EFN can be expressed as:

(19.5)EFN = New investments − Addition to retained earnings
Substituting “Growth rate × Initial total assets” for “New investments” in Equation 19.5 yields the following:

(19.6)EFN = (Growth rate × Initial total assets) − Addition to retained earnings
Applying Equation 19.6 to our Empire Enterprise situation, we get the following result:

The result, $5.2 million, agrees with the financial planning model calculation for Empire Enterprises presented earlier.

Equation 19.6 highlights two important points. First, holding dividend policy constant, the amount of EFN depends on the firm’s projected growth rate. The faster management expects the firm to grow, the more the firm needs to invest in new assets, and the more capital it has to raise. The potential sources of external capital are the sale of new stock and the sale of long-term debt. Second, the firm’s payout policy also affects EFN. Holding the growth rate constant, the higher the firm’s dividend payout ratio, the larger the amount of external debt or equity financing needed. Also, since EFN is the net amount of external funding needed, the more stock a firm repurchases, the more new capital it must raise to satisfy its EFN requirements if EFN is positive.

A Graphical View of Growth
Exhibit 19.11 illustrates Equation 19.6—the relation between sales growth rate and EFN—for Empire Enterprises. The horizontal axis plots the firm’s projected growth rate, and the vertical axis plots EFN. The slope of the line illustrates how EFN increases with the growth rate, assuming that dividend policy is held constant. As you can see, the line is upward sloping. This means that as the growth rate increases, the amount of EFN increases.

As a reference point in the exhibit, we plotted Empire’s EFN value of $5.2 million when the firm’s sales are growing at a 20 percent rate. If you want to generate the line yourself, all you need to do is make another calculation of EFN at a different growth rate, plot the points, and connect them with a straight line. However, the important point here is not the mechanics of generating the graph in Exhibit 19.11, but the interpretation of the line.

Turning to the exhibit, you can see that at low growth rates Empire Enterprises will generate more funds from earnings than it will spend on new investments. In these situations, the calculated value for EFN is negative (EFN < 0), and the firm has a surplus of funds. In other words, the internally generated funds exceed the firm’s planned investments. With the surplus funds, management may elect to retire some debt or repurchase some common stock. For example, at a 0 percent rate of growth, no funds are needed for expansion, and all the retained earnings are surplus, as we can see by using Equation 19.6:

With a higher growth rate, the surplus becomes smaller and smaller as more and more funds are used to finance the new investments. At a growth rate of 9.6 percent, the surplus equals zero, as does the calculated value of EFN. Next we explain how to calculate the growth rate at which the surplus equals zero. The key point here is that the higher the rate at which a firm grows, the more external funding it requires.

EXHIBIT 19.11 External Funding Needed (EFN) and Growth for Empire Enterprises The exhibit graphically illustrates Equation 19.6, showing the connection between growth rate in sales and EFN. The horizontal axis plots the firm’s projected growth rate, and the vertical axis plots EFN. The upward slope of the line illustrates how external funding increases with the growth rate, assuming that the dividend policy is held constant.


The Internal Growth Rate

Management often has an interest in knowing the rate at which the firm can grow using just internally generated funds. This rate is called the internal growth rate (IGR). The IGR is the maximum growth rate that a firm can achieve without external funding. To determine this rate, we set Equation 19.6 equal to zero (EFN = 0) and solve for the growth rate. Thus,

internal growth rate (IGR) the maximum growth rate that a firm can achieve without external funding

Rearranging terms yields the internal growth rate:

(19.7)
The managerial implications of the formula are straightforward. Firms that can generate a higher volume of retained earnings and/or use fewer assets can sustain a higher growth rate without raising more capital. For the Empire Enterprises example, the internal growth rate is calculated as:

To gain more insight into what factors determine a firm’s internal growth rate, we can manipulate Equation 19.7 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by net income and total equity, as follows:

If we then rearrange terms, we arrive at the following expression:

From the discussions in Chapter 4 and in this chapter, we know the following: (1) Plowback ratio = Addition to retained earnings/Net income; (2) Return on equity = Net income/Total equity; and (3) Equity multiplier = Total assets/Total equity.5 This means that we can write the above equation as:

(19.8)
Equation 19.8 tells us that firms that achieve higher growth rates without seeking external funding tend to have one or more of the following characteristics:

They have payout policies that retain a high proportion of earnings inside the firm—that is, they have a high plowback ratio.
They are able to generate a high net income with a smaller amount of equity than other firms and hence have a high return on equity (ROE).
They use low amounts of leverage; thus, their debt-to-equity ratios are low.
The Sustainable Growth Rate
Another growth rate helpful in long-term planning is the sustainable growth rate (SGR), which is the rate of growth that the firm can sustain without selling additional equity while maintaining the same capital structure. You may wonder why management is interested in the sustainable growth rate. The sustainable growth rate is important to managers of firms that are likely to generate excess funds internally and that want to determine the payout ratio that enables them to fund their firms’ growth while maintaining their current capital structures.

sustainable growth rate (SGR) the rate of growth that a firm can sustain without selling additional equity while maintaining the same capital structure

The sustainable growth rate is the rate at which a firm can grow using only (1) internally generated funds from earnings and (2) external funds from the sale of new debt while maintaining a constant debt equity ratio. As it turns out, SGR is a function of the firm’s plowback ratio and return on equity (ROE). SGR can be expressed as follows:

(19.9)SGR = Plowback ratio × ROE
For Empire Enterprises, the sustainable growth rate is:

The 13.3 percent rate is a fairly high SGR that is driven by the company’s rather hefty 33.3 percent return on equity.

An analysis of a company’s SGR relative to the company’s actual growth rate can provide management with some insights into problems the firm may face in the future. For example, if a firm’s actual growth rate consistently exceeds its SGR, managers know that unless they sell new equity, the firm will have a cash shortage problem in the future because of the need to purchase new assets to generate the growth. The SGR model does not, however, tell management how fast the firm should grow. That decision requires informed judgment about the attractiveness of the investment opportunities available to the firm.

Decision Making Example 19.2 and Learning by Doing Application 19.3 illustrate applications of the EFN, IGR, and SGR concepts.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 19.2
Empire’s Ambitious Growth Plan

Situation

You are part of the Empire Enterprises finance team. The firm’s strategic plan calls for revenues to grow at 20 percent next year. As mentioned, the board of directors is not interested in using any external equity funding. Some members of the team question whether these goals are realistic.

You have just been asked to comment on the proposed growth plan at a meeting. You have a little over an hour to prepare. During the time available, you completed the following calculations using data from the most recent and the pro forma income statements and balance sheets (Exhibits 19.9 and 19.10):

EFN = (Growth rate × Initial total assets) − Addition to retained earnings = (0.20 × $50 million) − $4.8 million = $5.2 million
IGR = Addition to retained earnings/Initial assets = $4.8 million/$50 million = 0.096, or 9.6%
SGR = Plowback ratio × ROE = 0.40 × 0.333 = 0.133, or 13.3%
Given the above information, what can you say about this ambitious growth plan?



LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 19.3
Sustainable Growth and Financial Statements

Problem

Because of your presentation (see Decision Making Example 19.2), Empire’s top management team has had second thoughts about its goal of growing the firm by 20 percent during the next year. As a result, you must prepare pro forma financial statements at a sales growth rate equal to the firm’s SGR of 13.3 percent.





Growth Rates and Profits
So far, we have focused on a firm’s rate of growth. In the final analysis, however, the critical question in business is not how fast the firm can grow, but whether the firm can sustain rapid growth and maintain a satisfactory level of profits. In reality, it is very difficult to achieve and sustain rapid growth in a competitive market and remain profitable. The business arena is littered with failed growth firms like Crumbs Bake Shop.

To provide a reality check, only 7 percent of publicly traded U.S. companies increase both revenues and operating profits by an average of 10 percent a year. Experts generally agree that growth rates at or above 10 percent are very difficult to sustain for established companies.

Growth as a Planning Goal
The final question we address is whether growth by itself is an acceptable strategic goal. We pose this question because it is common for top management to set growth rates as goals for the firm or operating divisions. In fact, there is nothing a CEO likes to do better at the annual meeting than point out that “last year, under my leadership, Sleepy Hollow exceeded its goal of 10 percent growth,” and have it followed by a hearty round of applause. Growth rate goals are popular because they are easy to communicate and understand. But are they appropriate goals for financial planning? The short answer is “no.” Let’s consider why this is the case.

As we discussed in Chapter 1, an appropriate goal for management is maximizing the market value of stockholders’ equity. If management invests in productive assets with positive NPVs, finances them at the lowest possible cost, and skillfully manages these assets, the company should be profitable and grow in size. This growth results from making sound business decisions and executing strategies that create sustainable competitive advantages over the long term. Thus, growth is an acceptable goal as long as it is anchored to a sound business strategy that will generate an increase in stockholder value.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Explain what a financial plan is and why financial planning is important.

A financial plan is a set of actionable goals derived from the firm’s strategic plan and other planning documents, such as the investment and financing plans. The financial plan focuses on selecting the best investment opportunities and determining how they will be financed. The financial plan is a blueprint for the firm’s future. Financial planning is important to management because the plan communicates the firm’s strategic goals throughout the organization, builds support for the firm’s strategies, and helps align operating unit goals with the firm’s strategic goals.

2 Discuss how management uses financial planning models in the planning process, and explain the importance of sales forecasts in the construction of financial planning models.

Financial models are the analytical part of the financial planning process. A planning model is simply a series of equations that model a firm’s financial statements, such as the income statement and balance sheet. Once the model is constructed, management can generate projected (pro forma) financial statements to determine the financial impact of proposed strategic initiatives on the firm.

For most financial planning models, a forecast of the firm’s sales is the most important input variable. The sales forecast is the key driver in financial planning models because many items on the income statement and balance sheet vary directly with sales. Thus, once sales are forecasted, it is easy to generate projected financial statements using the historical relation between a particular account and sales.

3 Discuss how the relation between projected sales and the income statement and balance sheet accounts can be determined, and analyze a strategic investment decision using a percent of sales model.

Historical financial data can be examined to determine whether and how a variable changes with sales. One way to do this is to prepare a table that shows four or five years of historical financial statement account data as a percent of sales. You can then fit trend lines to the data to see what type of relation exists between that variable and sales. Many income statement and balance sheet items vary directly with sales, but others may vary in a more discrete manner. The analysis in the Blackwell Sales Company example illustrates how to analyze a strategic investment decision.

4 Describe the conditions under which fixed assets vary directly with sales, and discuss the impact of so-called lumpy assets on this relation.

Fixed assets vary directly with sales only when assets can be added in small increments and production facilities are operating near full capacity. This is typically not the case. In most situations, fixed assets are added in large, discrete units, and as a result, much of the new capacity may go unused for a period of time. These types of assets are often called lumpy assets. After lumpy assets are added, sales can increase for a period of time with no corresponding change in the level of fixed assets.

5 Explain what factors determine a firm’s sustainable growth rate, discuss why it is of interest to management, and compute the sustainable growth rate for a firm.

A firm’s sustainable growth rate (SGR) is the maximum rate at which the firm can grow without external equity funding and with leverage held constant. The determinants of a firm’s SGR are (1) profit margins (the greater a firm’s profit margin, the greater the firm’s SGR); (2) asset utilization (the more efficiently a firm uses its assets, the higher its SGR); (3) financial leverage (as a firm increases its use of leverage, its SGR increases); (4) payout policy (as a firm decreases its payout ratio, its SGR increases); and (5) economic conditions (the more favorable the economic environment, the higher the firm’s SGR). Management may be interested in knowing the SGR for two reasons. First, the SGR is the rate of growth at which a firm’s capital structure (debt to equity) will remain constant without the firm selling or repurchasing stock. Second, if a firm’s actual growth rate exceeds its SGR, the firm could face cash shortage problems in the future unless it can sell new equity. Learning by Doing Application 19.3 uses the SGR formula.

19.30 EFN: Ritchie Marble Company has total assets of $12,899,450, sales of $18,174,652, and net income of $4,589,774. Management expects sales to grow by 25 percent next year. All assets and costs (including taxes) vary directly with sales, and management expects to maintain a payout ratio of 65 percent. Calculate Ritchie’s EFN.

19.31 EFN: Norton Group, Inc., expects to add $1,213,777 to retained earnings and currently has total assets of $23,159,852. If the company has the ability to borrow up to $1 million, how much growth can the firm support if it is willing to borrow to its maximum capacity?

19.32 EFN: Capstone Marketing Group has total assets of $5,568,000, sales of $3,008,725, and net income of $822,000. The company expects its sales to grow by 12 percent next year. All assets and costs (including taxes) vary directly with sales, and the firm expects to maintain a payout ratio of 55 percent. Calculate Capstone’s EFN.

19.36 Use the financial information for Morgan Construction Company from Problem 19.35. Assume now that equity accounts do not vary directly with sales but change when retained earnings change or new equity is issued. The company pays 75 percent of its income as dividends every year. In addition, the company plans to expand production capacity by expanding the current facility and acquiring additional equipment. This will cost the firm $10 million. The firm has no plans to issue new equity this year. Prepare a pro forma balance sheet using this information. Any funds that need to be raised (in addition to changes in current liabilities) will be in the form of long-term debt. What is the external funding needed in this case?

19.1 Mars Company had net sales of $18 million in the year that just ended. Next year, the company’s management expects a 15 percent increase in sales. If cost of goods sold is 60 percent of sales and inventory is 25 percent of sales, what would you estimate sales, inventory, and cost of goods sold to be next year?

19.2 Lavaca Inc. management expects net sales to be $855,000, total costs to be $647,000, and average tax rate to be 24 percent this year. If Lavaca pays out 38 percent of its earnings as dividends, what is its retention ratio? How much will Lavaca’s retained earnings increase?

19.3 Spurlock Inc. had net income of $266,778 in its most recent fiscal year and total assets of $1,833,400 at the end of the year. The company’s total debt ratio (total debt to total assets) is 35 percent, and Spurlock retains 60 percent of its income every year. What is Spurlock’s internal growth rate? What is its sustainable growth rate?

19.4 Using the information in Sample Test Problem 19.3, what is Spurlock’s capital intensity ratio if the company has net sales of $3,557,100? What does this ratio tell us?

19.5 Edgefield Excavation Company has total assets of $4,976,456, sales of $1,225,700, and net income of $587,000. The company’s management expects sales to grow by 9 percent next year. All costs (including taxes) and assets vary directly with sales, and the firm expects to maintain a payout ratio of 35 percent. Calculate the external funds needed (EFN) by Edgefield. What would Edgefield’s payout ratio have to be in order for the company’s EFN to equal zero?

Notes
1 The investment plan consists of the capital budget plus any acquisitions or divestitures management plans to make. To simplify our discussion in this chapter, we treat the investment plan and capital budget as one and the same because, for most firms, acquisitions and divestitures are not regular events.
2 The phrase pro forma is a Latin term that literally means “as a matter of form.” In its modern context in finance and accounting, pro forma refers to data that are hypothetical.
3 Note that to simplify the analysis, some of the income statement and balance sheet accounts used in the planning model are aggregated. For example, in our initial planning model, the balance sheet lists only total assets, debt, and equity.
4 Alternatively, we could have redone the preliminary pro forma balance sheet and found: total assets = $1.3 million and total liabilities and stockholders’ equity = $1.301 million ($244,000 + $200,000 + $857,000 = $1,301,000). Since total liabilities and stockholders’ equity is greater than total assets, we have more funds than we need. To make the balance sheet balance, we can reduce the notes payable by $1,000.
5 Note that the measure of leverage in Equation 19.8, Total equity/Total assets, is the inverse of the equity multiplier, Equation 4.11.

On December 17, 2020, Caledonia Mining Corporation announced that it had entered into an option agreement giving the company the exclusive right to explore gold mining opportunities in an area of Zimbabwe known as Connemara North. Connemara North is situated in the Gweru mining district, an area that has historically produced significant quantities of gold. Caledonia’s right to explore would last for up to 18 months, and if successful, the company could, at its discretion, acquire the mining claims to the area. To acquire the exploration rights, Caledonia agreed to an initial payment of $300,000. Another payment of $5 million would be required if the company ultimately opted to exercise its right to acquire the mining claims.

Founded in 1992, Caledonia Mining Corporation’s primary business was the operation of an existing gold mine, known as the Blanket Mine, in Zimbabwe. The exploration rights to the Connemara North site represented a significant opportunity to expand the company’s productive mining footprint in the country, if the surveys indicated that significant gold deposits were located on the land. The rights to the site also presented the company with potential operating synergies, as it was co-located with its current operations.

Of course, even if significant deposits of gold were discovered, Caledonia would need to assess one very significant factor before it exercised the right to purchase the mining claims. Specifically, management would need to have a sound estimate of the future price of an ounce of gold on the world market. This estimate would be based on an understanding of macroeconomic fundamentals that determine the supply and demand for the precious metal, and would be balanced against the costs of mining to determine the future cash flows from a potential mine. In the early 2000s, gold mines in the Gweru mining district shut down when the price of gold dropped below $300 per ounce and the mines became negative NPV projects. In late 2020, however, one ounce of gold was selling for well over $1,800.

To be sure, Caledonia could have purchased the mining rights to the Connemara North land outright, but doing so would have required considerably more money and would have been a much riskier strategy. The option to explore the site cost only a fraction of the cost of the mining rights and gave the company permission to carefully explore the potential value of a future mining operation on the land before making a much larger investment. Options such as those acquired by Caledonia Mining are one example of the many different types of options we see in the corporate world. This chapter explains what options are, some of their applications in corporate finance, how they can affect corporate decision making, and how they affect the value of a business.

Chapter Preview
Options and option-like payoffs add to the analytical frameworks that we have discussed in this book. Financial options, such as the right to buy or sell the shares of a company at a prespecified price, are often found in financial securities that firms issue and therefore must be considered in the valuation of those securities. Real options, such as those acquired by Caledonia Mining Corporation in the chapter opener, make calculation of a project’s NPV more complex. In order to fully understand the implications of these complications for financial analyses, it is important that you understand what options are and the types of options that are available to managers.

We begin with a discussion of financial options and how they are valued, because financial options are, in many ways, simpler than real options to illustrate and value. Many financial options are traded independently in the financial markets, while others are bundled with the financial instruments that managers issue and also trade in the financial markets. Since financial options are commonly traded, we know a lot about how they are valued.

We then turn to real options, which affect the value of corporate investments. As illustrated in the chapter opener, managers often have options to delay investing in a project, expand a project, abandon a project, change the technology employed in a project, and so on. You will see that the value of these options is not adequately reflected in a standard NPV analysis.

We next revisit the agency costs of debt that we discussed in Chapter 16. In particular, we show how option-like payoffs contribute to the dividend payout, asset substitution, and underinvestment conflicts. We follow this discussion with a related discussion of how option-like payoffs contribute to conflicts between stockholders and the managers who work for them. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of the ways in which managers use financial options to alter their companies’ exposure to various types of risks.

20.1 Financial Options
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Define a call option and a put option, and describe the payoff function for each of these options.
A financial option is a derivative security in that its value is derived from the value of another asset. The owner of a financial option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset on or before a specified date for a specified price. The asset that the owner has a right to buy or sell is known as the underlying asset. The last date on which an option can be exercised is called the exercise date or expiration date, and the price at which the option holder can buy or sell the asset is called the exercise price or strike price.

financial option the right to buy or sell a financial security, such as a share of stock, on or before a specified date for a specified price

derivative security a security that derives its value from the value of another asset; an option is an example of a derivative security

underlying asset the asset from which the value of an option is derived

exercise (expiration) date the last date on which an option can be exercised

exercise (strike) price the price at which the owner of an option has the right to buy or sell the underlying asset

Call Options
Let’s consider how the value of an option is derived from the value of an underlying asset. Suppose you own an option to buy one share of IBM stock for $150 per share and today is the exercise date. If you don’t exercise the option today, it will expire and become worthless. If the price of IBM’s stock is less than $150 per share, it does not make sense to exercise your option, because if you did, you would be paying $150 for something you could buy for less than $150 in the open market. Similarly, if the stock price is $150, there is no benefit to be had from exercising your option. If, however, the price is above $150, then you will benefit from exercising the option. Even if you do not want to own IBM stock, you can buy it for $150 and immediately turn around and sell it for a profit. The value of the option to you is the difference between the market price of IBM stock and the exercise price of the option. For example, if the IBM stock is trading for $160 per share in the market, then the option is worth $10 ($160 stock price − $150 exercise price = $10) to you. If the stock is trading for $170 per share, then the value of the option is $20 ($170 − $150 = $20), and so on.

The relation between the value of an option and the price (value) of the underlying asset, such as the IBM stock, is known as the option payoff function. Figure A in Exhibit 20.1 illustrates the payoff function at expiration (actually, the instant before the option expires) for the owner of an option that is like the IBM stock option we just discussed. This option is known as a call option because it gives the owner the right to buy, or “call,” the underlying asset.

option payoff function the function that shows how the value of an option varies with the value of the underlying asset

call option an option to buy the underlying asset

EXHIBIT 20.1 Payoff Functions for a Call Option at Expiration


With an exercise price of $150, the value of the IBM call option equals $0 if the price of the underlying stock is $150 or less. As we noted earlier, it would not make sense to exercise the option if the price of the stock is not greater than $150. Since an option is the right to buy or sell an underlying asset, rather than an obligation to buy or sell, the owner of the option can simply let it expire if it does not make sense to exercise it. This limits the downside for the owner of the option to $0.

If the underlying asset price is above the exercise price, the value of the call option at exercise increases dollar for dollar with the price of the underlying asset. You can see this relation in Figure A of the exhibit. For every dollar that the asset price exceeds the exercise price, the value of the call option increases by one dollar. In other words, the slope of the payoff function equals one when the underlying asset price is above the exercise price.

Figure B of Exhibit 20.1 illustrates the payoff function for a person who sells a call option. Notice that the payoff function for the seller is the mirror image of that for the owner (buyer) of the call option. This makes sense, since any gain for the owner is a loss for the seller. To see why this is true, let’s return to the IBM option example. Recall that if the stock is trading at $160 when the option expires, the call option is worth $10 to the owner, who can purchase the stock for $150 and then immediately sell it on the market for $160. The seller of the call option, though, must sell a share of stock that is worth $160 for $150, resulting in a $10 loss.

Figure B of Exhibit 20.1 shows that the payoff to the seller of the call option is never positive. It is negative when the price of the underlying asset is greater than the exercise price, and it equals zero when the price of the underlying asset is equal to or less than the exercise price. You may be wondering why anyone would ever sell a call option if the return is never positive. The reason is simply that the buyer pays the seller a fee to purchase the option. This fee, which is known as the call premium, makes the total return to the seller positive when the price of the underlying asset is near or below the exercise price.

call premium the price that the buyer of a call option pays the seller for that option

A call premium is just like the premium you pay when you purchase insurance for your car. In return for the insurance premium, the insurance company agrees to pay you if certain events occur, such as if you collide with another car or if a hailstorm damages the car. The seller of a call option is simply selling insurance to the buyer that pays the buyer when the value of the underlying asset is above the exercise price.

Put Options
While the owner of a call option has the right to buy the underlying asset at a prespecified price on or before the expiration date, the owner of a put option has the right to sell the underlying asset at a prespecified price. The payoff function for the owner of a put option is similar to that for a call option, but it is the reverse in the sense that the owner of a put option profits if the price of the underlying asset is below the exercise price. This is illustrated in Exhibit 20.2.

put option an option to sell the underlying asset

EXHIBIT 20.2 Payoff Functions for a Put Option at Expiration


Figure A of the exhibit shows that the owner of a put option will not want to exercise that option if the price of the underlying asset is above the exercise price. Obviously, it does not make sense to sell an asset for less than you can get on the open market. When the value of the underlying asset is below the exercise price, however, the owner of the put option will find it profitable to exercise the option. For example, suppose that you own a put option that is expiring today and that entitles you to sell a share of IBM stock for $150. If the current price of IBM stock in the market is $145, the put option is worth $5 to you because exercising the option will enable you to buy a share of stock for $145 and then turn around and sell it for $150. Similarly, if the current price of IBM stock is $130, the put option is worth $20 because you can buy the stock for $130 and sell it for $150.

Figure B of Exhibit 20.2 shows that the payoff for the seller of the put option is negative when the price of the underlying asset is below the exercise price. This is because the seller of the put option is obligated to purchase the asset at a price that is higher than its market price. For instance, in the IBM put option example, if the exercise price is $150 and the current market price is $130, the seller of the put option must buy the stock for $150 but can only sell it for $130. This results in a $20 loss.

As with a call option, the payoff for the seller of a put option, which is illustrated in Figure B of Exhibit 20.2, is never positive. The seller of a put option hopes to profit from the fee, or put premium, that he or she receives from the buyer of the put option.

put premium the price that the buyer of a put option pays the seller of that option

Decision Making Example 20.1 illustrates the decision of when to exercise an option.

DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 20.1
When It Makes Sense to Exercise an Option

Situation

You own a call option and a put option on a share of Ford Motor Company stock. The exercise price for both of these options is $18 per share, and both options expire today. If the current price of Ford stock is $17, would you exercise either of these options? If so, which one?



American, European, and Bermudan Options
At the beginning of this section, we said that the owner of a financial option has the right to buy or sell a specific asset on or before a specified date for a specified price. In the real world, there are actually several different arrangements concerning when an option can be exercised. Some options can only be exercised on the expiration date. These are known as European options. Other options, known as American options, can be exercised at any point in time on or before the expiration date. There are also exotic options, such as so-called Bermudan options, that can be exercised only on specific dates during the life of the option. Most exchange-traded options (even in Europe) are American options.

More on the Shapes of Option Payoff Functions
It is important to note that the payoff functions in Exhibits 20.1 and 20.2 illustrate the values of options to owners and sellers at the instant before they expire. These payoff functions have similar, but somewhat different, shapes at earlier points in time. We discuss why this is the case in the next section.

Building Intuition
Payoff Functions for Options are not Linear

Payoff functions for options are not straight lines. This is because the owners of options have the right, rather than the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying assets. If it is not in the owner’s best interest to exercise an option, he or she can simply let it expire without exercising it. This limits the owner’s potential loss to the value of the premium he or she paid for the option.

It is also important to recognize that the payoff functions in Exhibits 20.1 and 20.2 are not straight lines for all possible values of the underlying asset. Each payoff function has a “kink” at the exercise price and thus is not linear. This kink exists because the owner of the option has a right, not an obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset. If it is not in the owner’s interest to exercise the option, he or she can simply let it expire. Later, we will discuss how this feature of options is related to agency problems and how it can be useful in managing the risks faced by a firm.

20.2 Option Valuation
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

List and describe the variables that affect the value of an option. Calculate the value of a call option and of a put option.
We saw in the preceding section that determining the value of a call or a put option at the instant before it expires is relatively simple. For a call option, if the value of the underlying asset is less than or equal to the exercise price, the value of the option to the owner is $0. If the value of the underlying asset is greater than the exercise price, the value to the owner is simply the value of the underlying asset minus the exercise price. For a put option, if the value of the underlying asset is greater than or equal to the exercise price, the value of the option is $0 to the owner. If the value of the underlying asset is less than the exercise price, the value to the owner is the exercise price minus the value of the underlying asset.

It is more complicated to determine the value of an option at a point in time before its expiration date. We don’t know exactly how the value of the underlying asset will change over time, and therefore we don’t know what value the owner will ultimately receive from the option. In this section, we discuss the key variables that affect the value of an option prior to expiration and describe one method that is commonly used to value options. Our objective is not to make you an expert in option valuation, but rather to help you develop some intuition about what makes an option more or less valuable. This intuition will help you better understand how options affect corporate finance decisions.

Limits on Option Values
Let’s begin by using some common sense to put limits on what the value of a call option can possibly be prior to its expiration date. We focus on call options here because, as you will see, there is a simple relation that enables us to calculate the value of a put option once we know the value of a call option with the same exercise price.

We already know that the value of a call option can never be less than zero, since the owner of the option can always decide not to exercise it if doing so is not beneficial. A second limit on the value of a call option is that it can never be greater than the value of the underlying asset. It would not make sense to pay more for the right to buy an asset than you would pay for the asset itself. These two limits suggest that the value of a call option prior to expiration must be in the shaded area in Figure A of Exhibit 20.3. The shaded area is bounded below by the horizontal axis, because the value of the option must be greater than $0, and it is bounded above by the line that slopes upward at a 45-degree angle, because an option value greater than this would exceed the value of the underlying asset.

EXHIBIT 20.3 Possible Values of a Call Option Prior to Expiration


There are two other limits on the value of a call option prior to expiration, and these limits are somewhat more subtle. First, the value of a call option prior to the expiration date will never be less than the value of that option if it had to be exercised immediately. This is true because there is always a possibility that the value of the underlying asset will be greater than it is today at some time before the option expires. Of course, it is possible that the value will be lower, but since the value of the option cannot be less than $0 and there is no limit on how high it can go, the expected effect of an increase in the value of the underlying asset on the value of the option is greater than the expected effect of a decrease. The bottom line is that, prior to expiration, the value of a call option will be greater than the value represented by the solid red line in Figure A of Exhibit 20.1 (in the preceding section).1

The fourth and final limit arises because of the time value of money. When we consider the value of a call option at some time prior to expiration, we must compare the current value of the underlying asset with the present value of the exercise price, discounted at the risk-free rate. We would be comparing apples and oranges if we did not do this. The present value of the exercise price is the amount that an investor would have to invest in risk-free securities at any point prior to the expiration date to ensure that he or she would have enough money to exercise the option when it expired. Thus, when we compare the value of a call option prior to expiration with the value at expiration, represented by the solid red line in Figure A of Exhibit 20.1, we must use the present value of the exercise price to draw the line. The shaded area in Figure B of Exhibit 20.3 illustrates the possible values for a call option prior to expiration under all four of the limits we have discussed.

In practice, we find that, prior to expiration, call options have a shape that is very similar to the one illustrated by the dotted line in Figure C of Exhibit 20.3. Notice that this dotted line approaches $0 as the value of the underlying asset gets very small relative to the exercise price. This makes sense because, with a very low asset value, it becomes highly unlikely that the owner of the option will ever choose to exercise it.

On the right side of the dotted line, you can see that the value of a call option prior to expiration approaches the value of the call option at expiration. This is because when the current value of the underlying asset is far to the right of the kink in the option’s payoff function, the probability that this value will fall below the exercise price is very small. In other words, the expected effect of an increase in the value of the underlying asset on the value of the option is no longer much greater than the expected effect of a decrease.

Finally, notice that the dotted line is farthest above the value of the call option at expiration when the price of the underlying asset is near the exercise price. At the exercise price, the expected effect of an increase in the value of the underlying asset on the value of the option exceeds the expected effect of a decrease by the greatest amount.

Variables That Affect Option Values
Five variables affect the value of a call option prior to expiration. Four of them are related to the following questions:

How likely is it that the value of the underlying asset will be higher than the exercise price the instant before the option expires?
How far above the exercise price might it be?
The first two variables are relatively easy to understand. They are the current value of the underlying asset and the exercise price. The higher the current value of the underlying asset, the more likely it is that the value of the asset will be above the exercise price when the call option nears expiration. Furthermore, the higher the current value of the asset, the greater the likely difference between the value of the asset and the exercise price. This means that, holding the exercise price constant, investors will pay more for a call option if the underlying asset value is higher, because the expected value of the option as it nears expiration is higher.2 For example, suppose that you are considering purchasing a three-month American call option on a share of IBM stock with an exercise price of $150. You should be willing to pay more for this option if the current price of IBM stock is $155 than if it is $150.

The opposite relation applies to the exercise price. That is, the lower the exercise price, the more likely that the value of the underlying asset will be higher than the exercise price when the option nears expiration. In addition, the lower the exercise price, the greater the likely difference between these two amounts. Thus, the lower the exercise price, the more valuable the option is likely to be at expiration. Of course, if the option is expected to be more valuable at expiration, it will also be more valuable at any point prior to expiration. Returning to our IBM example, we see that a call option with an exercise price of $145 is worth more than a call option with an exercise price of $150.

We turn next to two variables that affect the value of call options in somewhat more subtle ways. These variables are the volatility of the value of the underlying asset and the time until the expiration of the option. To understand how these factors affect the value of a call option, recall from Figure C of Exhibit 20.3 that the payoff function for a call option prior to expiration is not symmetric. If the value of the underlying asset is well above the exercise price, then the value of the option varies in much the same way as the value of the underlying asset. However, if the value of the underlying asset is well below the exercise price, then the value of the option approaches $0, but changes at a much lower rate than the value of the underlying asset changes. It does not matter if the underlying asset value is just a little bit below the exercise price or is completely worthless—a call option cannot be worth less than $0.

To show how the volatility of the underlying asset value affects the value of an option, we will consider a call option on an underlying asset that has a value exactly equal to the exercise price of the option. Since the downside for the owner is limited to $0, the value of this option will increase more when the value of the underlying asset goes up than it will decrease when the value of the underlying asset goes down. Let’s suppose that the value of the underlying asset is equally likely to go up or down. In this case, the farther the value of the asset is likely to move (the greater its volatility), the higher the value of a call option on this asset will be. In other words, the greater the volatility of the underlying asset value, the higher the value of a call option on the asset prior to expiration.

In our IBM example, suppose the exercise price for a call option on IBM stock is $150, the current price of the stock is $150, and the option expires in one year. Further suppose that the standard deviation, σ, of the return on the IBM stock is 30 percent per year. Recall from the discussion in Chapter 7 that with a standard deviation of 30 percent, there is a 5 percent chance that the IBM stock price will change by more than 58.8 percent (1.96 standard deviations × 30 percent = 58.8 percent) by the time the option expires. In other words, there is a 5 percent chance that the IBM stock price will be less than $61.80 [$150 × (1 − 0.588) = $61.80] or greater than $238.20 [$150 × (1 + 0.588) = $238.20] in a year. If, instead of 30 percent, the standard deviation of IBM stock was 40 percent per year, there would be a 5 percent chance that the price would be below $32.40 or above $267.60. (You should check these numbers to make sure you know how they are calculated.) As you can see, this higher standard deviation means the stock price is more volatile. Investors will pay more for an option on a stock that has a more volatile price, because the potential change in the stock’s price is greater.

The time until the expiration affects the value of a call option through its effect on the volatility of the value of the underlying asset. The greater the time to maturity, the more the value of the underlying asset is likely to change by the time the option expires. Let’s return once again to the IBM example. Suppose that the option expires in two years rather than in one year. People who study statistics have found that the standard deviation of the return on an asset increases over time by the square root of n, where n is the number of periods. Thus, if the standard deviation of the return on IBM stock is 30 percent per year, the standard deviation over two years will be:

Clearly, then, a two-year option will be worth more than a one-year option if all other characteristics of the options are the same.

We’ve now discussed four of the five variables that affect the value of an option. The fifth variable is the risk-free rate of interest. The value of a call option increases with the risk-free rate. Exercising a call option involves paying cash in the future for the underlying asset. The higher the interest rate, the lower the present value of the amount that the owner of a call option will have to pay to exercise it.

The Binomial Option Pricing Model
In this section, we use a simple model to show how we can calculate the value of a call option at some point before the expiration date. This model assumes that the underlying asset will have one of only two possible values when the option expires. The value of the underlying asset will either increase to some value above the exercise price or decrease to some value below the exercise price.

To solve for the value of the call option using this model, we must assume that investors have no arbitrage opportunities with regard to this option. Arbitrage is the act of buying and selling assets in a way that yields a return above that suggested by the Security Market Line (SML), which we discussed in Chapter 7. In other words, the absence of arbitrage opportunities means that investors cannot earn a return that is greater than that justified by the systematic risk associated with an investment. As an example of an arbitrage opportunity, suppose that the stock of a particular company is being sold for a lower price in one country than in another country. An investor could simultaneously buy the stock in the country where it is less expensive and sell it in the country where it is more expensive. Assuming that the profit exceeds any transaction costs, the investor would earn an instantaneous risk-free profit. Since it is instantaneous, this profit would, by definition, be above the SML, because the SML would predict that the expected return on a risk-free investment is zero if the holding period is zero.

arbitrage buying and selling assets in a way that takes advantage of price discrepancies and yields a profit greater than that which would be expected based solely on the systematic risk of the individual investments

To value the call option in our simple model, we will first create a portfolio that consists of the asset underlying the call option and a risk-free loan. The relative investments in these two assets will be selected so that the combination of the asset and the loan have the same cash flows as the call option, regardless of whether the value of the underlying asset goes up or down. This is called a replicating portfolio, since it replicates the cash flows of the option. The replicating portfolio must have the same value as the option today, since it has the same cash flows as the call option in all possible future outcomes. If the replicating portfolio did not have the same value as the option, an investor could construct an arbitrage portfolio by buying the cheaper of the two and selling the more expensive of the two. Such trading would eventually drive the values of the option and the replicating portfolio together.

To see how a replicating portfolio is constructed, consider an example. Suppose that the stock of ABC Corporation currently trades for $50 and that its price will be either $70 or $40 in one year. We want to determine the value of a call option to buy ABC stock for $55 in one year. First, notice that the value of this option is $15 if the stock price goes up to $70 ($70 − $55 = $15) and that it is $0 if the stock price goes down to $40, since the option will not be exercised. Suppose also that the risk-free rate is 5 percent.

We can construct a portfolio consisting of x shares of ABC Corporation stock and a risk-free loan with a value of y dollars that produces a payoff of either $70 or $40. The risk-free loan may involve either borrowing or lending, as you will see. For each risk-free dollar we lend, we know that we will receive $1.05 regardless of what happens to the price of ABC stock. In the same way, if we borrow $1, we will owe $1.05 at the end of the year. The value of the stock, the risk-free loan, and the option today and at expiration can be illustrated as follows.


The value of each asset when the stock price goes up to $70 is shown on the right arrow, and the value when the stock goes down to $40 is shown on the left arrow. Notice that we do not know the value of the option today—that is what we are trying to calculate.

We can write two equations that define the replicating portfolio that we want to construct:

The first equation represents the case in which the stock price increases to $70, and the second equation represents the case in which the stock price goes down to $40. The first equation says that we want the portfolio to be worth $15 when the stock price increases to $70 and that the $15 value will consist of x shares of stock worth $70 and a risk-free loan with a face value of y and a value in one year of $1.05 per dollar of face value. Similarly, the second equation says that if the stock price falls to $40, we want the portfolio to be worth $0. In this case, the portfolio will consist of x shares of stock worth $40 and a risk-free loan with a face value of y and a value in one year of $1.05 per dollar of face value.

Since we have two equations and there are two unknowns, x and y, we can solve for the values of the unknowns. Recall from your algebra class that we can solve for x and y by first writing one equation in terms of either x or y and then substituting the result into the second equation. For example, the first equation can be written in terms of x as follows:

Now, substituting into the second equation gives us:

We can now solve this equation for y as follows:

Therefore:

Finally, substituting this value back into the first equation gives us the value of x:

This tells us that the replicating portfolio consists of one-half share of ABC Corporation stock (x = 0.50) and a $19.05 risk-free loan (y = −$19.05). The negative value for y tells us that we would borrow, rather than lend, $19.05 at the risk-free rate. If we buy one-half share of stock and borrow $19.05, then in one year our replicating portfolio will have exactly the same payoff as the call option with an exercise price of $55.

If the value of the stock declined to $40, we would own one-half share of stock worth $20, and we would owe $19.05 × 1.05 = $20 on the loan. Since the value of the stock would exactly equal the amount owed on the loan, the portfolio would have a total value of exactly $0. In contrast, if the value of the stock increased to $70, the one-half share of stock would be worth $35. Since we would still owe only $20 in this case, the portfolio would have a total value of $15. These payoffs are exactly the same as those for the option, so this portfolio must have the same value as the option.

At this point, we know what the replicating portfolio consists of, and we know that the replicating portfolio must have the same value as the call option. Now all we have to do to estimate the value of the call option is to figure out what the value of the replicating portfolio is. To do this, we simply determine how much of our own money we would actually have to invest to construct the replicating portfolio. In our example, we could use the $19.05 loan to help purchase the stock, so we would not have to come up with all the money for the stock on our own. In fact, since a share of ABC Corporation stock is currently worth $50, one-half share of this stock would cost only $25. Therefore, we would have to come up with only $5.95 ($25.00 − $19.05 = $5.95) over and above the amount received from the loan to buy the stock. Since $5.95 is the amount of money that we would actually have to invest to obtain the replicating portfolio, it is the value of this portfolio and therefore the value of the call option.

The equation for calculating the value of the replicating portfolio, and therefore the value of the call option, can be expressed as follows:

Notice, too, that the exercise price, the current price of the underlying stock, the possible future prices of the underlying stock, and the risk-free rate are all that entered into our calculations. We did not even mention the probabilities that the stock price would go up or down at any point. That is because the volatility of the underlying stock value is accounted for by how far apart the two possible future values are. Similarly, the time to expiration is not directly considered. However, the time to expiration affects how high and how low the stock price can be when the option expires.3

This model may seem surprisingly simple. However, that is largely because we chose to illustrate a simple example. The model can be extended in several ways. For example, we can incorporate possible prices for the underlying asset between now and the expiration date of the option. The underlying asset price might take one of two values one month (or day or hour) from now, and then for each of those values there might be two possible values in the following month (day or hour), and so on. Solving a model such as this requires us to work backward from the expiration date to find the value of the option at each intermediate date and price until we finally arrive at the value of the option today. Most modern option pricing models are extensions of this type of model.

Put-Call Parity
To this point, our discussion has focused on call options. As mentioned earlier, this is possible because there is a simple relation that enables us to calculate the value of a put option once we know the value of a call option with the same exercise price. This relation is called put-call parity. The formula for put-call parity is:

(20.1)
put-call parity the relation between the value of a call option on an asset and the value of a put option on the same asset that has the same exercise price

Valuing a Call Option

Problem

You are considering purchasing a call option on the stock of Grote Agricultural Company. Grote stock currently trades for $35 per share, and you predict that its price will be either $25 or $50 in one year. The call option would enable you to buy a share of Grote stock in one year for $30. What is this option worth if the risk-free rate is 4 percent?





where P is the value of the put option, C is the value of the call option, X is the exercise price, r is the risk-free rate, t is the amount of time before the option expires, and V is the current value of the underlying asset. The term e−rt is an exponential function that you can calculate using the “ex” key on your calculator; it is simply a discount factor that assumes continuous compounding. It is important to make sure that the r and t are both stated in the same units of time (for example, months or years).

To see how this formula works, let’s consider the call option on the stock of ABC Corporation that we just valued. We know that C = $5.95, X = $55, r = 0.05, t = 1, and V = $50. Substituting these values into the put-call parity formula and solving for P, we get

Notice that the variables used in this calculation are the same variables that determine the value of a call option. This means that the same factors that affect the value of a call option also affect the value of a put option. Notice, too, that the value of the put option ($8.27) is greater than the value of the call option ($5.95) in this example. This will not always be true. However, it is true in our example because the current stock price of $50 is below the $55 exercise price.

Learning by Doing Application 20.2 illustrates another example of a put option valuation.

Valuing Options Associated with the Financial Securities That Firms Issue
In the chapter preview, we stated that financial options are often included in the financial securities that firms issue and that they make the valuation of those securities more complicated. A detailed discussion of the valuation of financial securities with options is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, because such options are quite common, it is important that you have some intuition concerning how they affect security values. The key principle that we use in valuing securities with options is known as the principle of value additivity. It states that if two independent assets are bundled together, the total value of both assets equals the sum of their individual values. In other words, the value of a financial security with an option equals the value of the same security without the option, plus the value of the option. To illustrate this idea, let’s consider a few of the many options that are commonly observed in financial securities.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 20.2
Valuing a Put Option

Problem

In Learning by Doing Application 20.1, we found that a call option on a share of Grote Agricultural Company stock is worth $8.77 when the stock price is $35, the exercise price is $30, the risk-free rate is 4 percent, and the time to maturity is one year. What is the value of a put option on a share of this stock if the exercise price and all other variables have the same values?





Note that the value of the put option is less than the value of the call option in this example. This is because the current price of the stock is above the exercise price.

Financial options are often added to the securities that firms issue because doing so is beneficial to the firm. For example, when the managers of a young, rapidly growing company issue debt, they must be concerned about the amount of cash required to make interest and principal payments. If these payments are too great, the company’s operations might not generate enough cash to both service the debt and fund the company’s growth. One way to reduce the interest payments on debt is to make it convertible into common stock.

To see how this works, consider the convertible bonds that we described in Chapter 8. Suppose that a 20-year vanilla bond issued by a particular company must have coupon payments of $80 per year, or 8 percent, in order to sell for its par value of $1,000. Further suppose that management of that company must raise $50 million today and only expects to have enough cash to pay interest of $3 million per year, or 6 percent, on the $50 million.

One way to reduce the amount of interest that the firm must pay on the bonds is to make them convertible into the company’s stock. For example, if the company’s stock is currently trading at $40 per share, the bond might be structured so that buyers have the option (right, but not obligation) to convert each bond into 20 shares of stock. With this arrangement, each bond includes a call (conversion) option with an exercise price of $50 per share ($1,000/20 shares = $50 per share). The exercise price of the conversion option is above the current stock price. However, since there is a chance that the stock price will go above $50 before the debt matures in 20 years, this call option has a value that can be calculated using the binomial option pricing model.

When a conversion option is included with a bond, investors will be willing to accept a lower interest rate. How much lower depends on the value of the option. If the company wants to sell the convertible bonds at their par value of $1,000, the present value of the interest and principal payments plus the value of the conversion option must equal $1,000. In the example above, if the bonds are going to pay 6 percent, the conversion option must be worth $197.93. This is because the valuation methods discussed in Chapter 8 tell us that a 20-year bond paying a coupon of 6 percent is only worth $802.07 if the market requires a return of 8 percent (you might check this number to confirm that you understand the bond valuation concepts from Chapter 8). If a conversion option with an exercise price of $50 is worth more or less than $197.93, then management will have to adjust the exercise price upward or downward until the total value of the 6 percent bond plus the conversion option equals $1,000.

Convertible preferred stock provides another common example of a financial security that has an option associated with it. This type of preferred stock, which is typically sold to venture capitalists, for example, is convertible into the common stock of the company at a prespecified exercise price. Recall from Chapter 9 that regular preferred stock with no maturity can be valued using the zero-growth dividend model, Equation 9.2:

For example, if the preferred stock pays an annual dividend, D, of $10 and the required rate of return, k ps, is 10 percent, then the value of the preferred stock is $100 ($10/0.10 = $100). If this preferred stock is made convertible into the company’s common stock, its value will be greater than $100 by an amount that equals the value of the conversion option. The company will get a higher price for convertible preferred stock because it is selling investors both regular preferred stock and a conversion option.

Convertible bonds and preferred shares are not the only types of securities that firms issue with options attached to them. In another common transaction, managers sell financial securities with options when they bundle options to purchase a company’s common stock with common shares that are being sold in an initial public offering (IPO). When this happens, for each 100 shares that an investor purchases, he or she also receives options (which are called warrants in this instance) to purchase additional shares, on or before a specified future date, for a price that is higher than the IPO price. For example, if the shares are expected to sell for $10 each in the IPO, the investor might have the option to purchase a certain number of shares at any time in the next five years for $15 per share. Why would the managers of a firm bundle options with stock in an IPO? One reason is to reduce the number of common shares that must be sold at the IPO price in order to raise the amount of money that the firm needs. As was the case with convertible bonds and preferred stock, since the options have value, investors will pay a higher price for the package of stock plus options than they will for the stock alone.

20.3 Real Options
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Identify some of the real options that occur in business, and explain why traditional NPV analysis does not accurately incorporate their values.
Many investments in business involve real options—options on real assets. Unfortunately, as we mentioned in the chapter preview, NPV analysis does not adequately reflect the value of these options. While it is not always possible to directly estimate the value of the real options associated with a project, it is important to recognize that they exist when we perform a project analysis. If we do not even consider them, we are ignoring potentially important sources of value. In this section, we provide an overview of the types of real options commonly associated with real investments. As you read this section, you should note that the first three types of real options—options to defer investments, make follow-on investments, and change operations—are call options, while the fourth type of real option—the option to abandon a project—is a put option.

real option an option for which the underlying asset is a real asset

Options to Defer Investment
In the chapter opener, we used the example of Caledonia Mining Corporation to illustrate a kind of real option that is commonly available to business managers. This is the option to defer making an investment decision. Recall that Caledonia obtained an option that gave the company the right to purchase mining claims in the Connemara North site of Zimbabwe. This option gave the managers at Caledonia an opportunity to better assess the economic viability of the mining claims before committing the large amount of money that would be required to purchase them. Caledonia’s managers must have thought that the price of the option was worth paying in order to be able to make more informed investment decisions. With this option, we can think of the underlying asset as being the stream of cash flows associated with owning the mining claims and the exercise price as being the cost of purchasing those claims. While it is too soon, at the time this discussion is being written, to tell how things will ultimately work out for Caledonia Mining, you can be sure that its managers will be better informed when they do make the final investment decision regarding the option that they acquired.

Real estate developers often purchase deferral options on properties that they might want to develop in the near future. For example, a developer might pay a landowner $100,000 for a one-year option to purchase a property at a particular price. By accepting the payment, the landowner agrees not to sell the property to anyone else for a year. As in the Caledonia Mining example, such an option provides the developer with more time to make a final decision on whether it makes economic sense to purchase the land and proceed with a project. With these options, the land is the underlying asset, and the cost of purchasing it is the exercise price.

Another example of an option to defer investment is found in the oil industry. Many oil companies own drilling rights on properties that are expected to contain oil deposits but have not yet been developed. In these situations, the oil companies have the option to wait and see what happens to oil prices before deciding whether to invest in developing the deposits. The underlying asset in this case is the stream of cash flows that the developed oil field is expected to produce, whereas the exercise price is the amount of money that the company would have to spend to develop it (drill the well and build any necessary infrastructure). Just as the value of a share of stock might go up or down, the value of the cash flows produced by the oil field might increase or decrease with the price of oil.

The value of an option to defer investment is not reflected in an NPV analysis. Recall that the NPV rule tells us to accept a project with a positive NPV and to reject one with a negative NPV. NPV analysis does not allow for the possibility of deferring an investment decision (or deferring completion of a project once it is underway). It assumes that we invest either now or never. However, if we have the option of deferring an investment decision, it may make sense to do so. After all, a project that has a negative NPV today might have a positive NPV at some point in the future. The price of the product may increase, production costs may decline, or the cost of capital may go down, making the project attractive. We need not assume that an investment that is unattractive today will never be attractive.

Options to Make Follow-On Investments
Another very important type of real option is an option to make follow-on investments. Some projects open the door to future business opportunities that would not otherwise be available. For example, until the late 1990s, Dell, Inc., focused on selling computers to businesses. Although the company sold computers to individuals for home use, it did not focus on that market segment. In the late 1990s, Dell decided to target the home personal computer market and introduced a low-price, bare-bones computer. At first glance, this did not look like a very good move, because the low-end home computer business has small profit margins. However, the move created options for a wide range of follow-on investments. By moving into the home computer market, Dell established relationships with many individual consumers. These relationships, in turn, made it feasible for Dell to later move into new product areas, such as the sale of headphones, webcams, printers, and other consumer electronics. In other words, investing in the home computer business provided Dell with options to enter other consumer product markets.

Another example of an option to make follow-on investments concerns an investment in a new technology that can be extended to other products. For instance, in the early 1990s, Boeing Company invested in a computer-aided aircraft design system as part of the development of its Boeing 777 aircraft. This system allowed the company to complete much more of the design work for a new aircraft on a computer before building a prototype, thereby lowering the cost of designing and building a new aircraft. While the cost of the new system and the associated facilities—over $1 billion—was relatively high compared with the cost of the 777 project, the investment provided benefits that extended well beyond that project. For example, the technologies could be used in the design of other new aircraft, both civilian and military. By reducing the cost of developing new aircraft, the design system made projects such as the successful line of 787 Dreamliner aircraft economically attractive.

Options to make follow-on investments are inherently difficult to value because, at the time we are evaluating the original project, it may not be obvious what the follow-on projects will be. Even if we know what the projects will be, we are unlikely to have enough information to estimate what they are worth. Of course, this makes it impossible to directly estimate the value of any option associated with them. Nevertheless, it is important for managers to consider options to make follow-on investments when evaluating projects. Doing so is a central part of the process of evaluating projects in the context of the overall strategy of the firm. Projects that have the potential for follow-on investment opportunities that are consistent with a company’s overall strategy are more valuable than otherwise similar projects that do not.

Options to Change Operations
In addition to options to defer investment and options to make follow-on investments, which are real options related to the investment decisions themselves, there are also real options that are related to the flexibility managers have once an investment decision has been made. These options, which include the options to change operations and to abandon a project, affect the NPV of a project and must be taken into account at the time the investment decision is made.

In an NPV analysis, we discount the expected cash flows from a project. We often consider several alternative scenarios and use our estimates of the probabilities associated with those scenarios to compute the expected cash flows. While this sort of analysis does consider alternative scenarios, it does not fully account for the fact that once a project has begun, the managers at a company have options to change operations as business conditions change. This means that there is value associated with being able to change operations that is not fully reflected in a scenario analysis.

The changes that managers might make can involve something as simple as reducing output if prices decline or increasing output if prices increase. Businesses do this all the time in response to changing demand for their goods and services. At the extreme, managers might temporarily suspend operations entirely if business conditions are weak. This is quite common in the auto industry, where we often hear of plants being temporarily shut down during periods of slow auto sales. Other changes in operations can involve fundamentally altering the way in which a product is produced, as when a new production technology becomes available, making the old technology uncompetitive.

Having the flexibility to react to changing business conditions can be very valuable. Since we do not know precisely how conditions are likely to change, it can be difficult to estimate just how valuable this flexibility is. Nevertheless, we can see that managers do recognize the importance of flexibility by observing how they structure projects. For example, most modern office buildings do not have permanent internal walls. Not having permanent walls provides flexibility in configuring the offices and work spaces in the building. If more people must be put into a building than originally anticipated, the work spaces can be compressed to fit them. If the company finds that it does not need all of the space, having a flexible interior makes it easier to change things so that the excess space can be leased. Similarly, when a company plans to build a new manufacturing facility, it often acquires more land than is immediately needed and designs the facility to accommodate additional production capacity if demand for its products is greater than expected.

Building flexibility into a project costs money, but this can be money well spent if things change unexpectedly. The flexibility to expand, scale back, temporarily shut down, or change the methods or technology employed in a project are all real options that managers should consider when evaluating projects. Projects with more flexibility in these dimensions are inherently more valuable.

Options to Abandon Projects
A project can also be terminated if things do not go as well as anticipated.4 In other words, management often has an option to abandon a project. The ability to choose to terminate a project is a bit like a put option. By shutting down the project, management is saving money that would otherwise be lost if the project kept going. The amount saved represents the gain from exercising this option.

As with flexibility, we can see that managers recognize the importance of having an option to abandon a project by observing the way they design projects. Consider, for example, that most industrial buildings are built like big boxes that can be easily reconfigured as manufacturing spaces, warehouses, or even retail outlets, depending on which use is most valuable. Suppose a company is building a facility to use as a warehouse. If the building is only able to accommodate a warehouse facility, it might end up sitting empty for long periods of time. Designing the building so that it can be reconfigured relatively inexpensively for some other use increases the likelihood that the building will remain fully utilized in the future.

You work for a company that manufactures cardboard packaging under long-term contracts for several popular cereal and pasta brands. You have just won a five-year contract to produce packaging materials for a company that sells furniture on the Internet. Since this contract will require you to produce much larger boxes than you currently can produce, you must purchase some new equipment. You have narrowed your choices to two alternatives. The first is a capital-intensive process that will cost more up front but will be less expensive to operate. This process requires very specialized equipment that can be used only for the type of packaging that your furniture client needs. The second alternative is a labor-intensive process that will require a smaller up-front investment but will have higher unit costs. This process involves equipment that can be used to produce a wide range of other packages. If the expected life of both alternatives is 10 years and you estimate the NPV to be the same for both, which should you choose?



Decision Making Example 20.2 presents an example of how real options affect investment decisions.

Concluding Comments on NPV Analysis and Real Options
We have stated that NPV analysis does not account for real options very well. This is true because the riskiness of a project that has real options associated with it varies with time, and the appropriate discount rate varies with the risk. For example, in order to use NPV analysis to value an option to expand operations, we would not only have to estimate the expected value of all the cash flows associated with the expansion but would also have to estimate the probability that we would actually undertake the expansion under alternative future scenarios and determine the appropriate rate(s) at which to discount the incremental cash flows from the expansion back to the present. Furthermore, the discount rate for the original project’s cash flows could change with the expansion.

In some cases, we can incorporate the value of a real option into an investment analysis by valuing the option separately and then adding this value to the NPV estimate. When we do this, we value the real option using valuation methods similar to those used to value financial options, as illustrated in Section 20.2.

20.4 Agency Costs
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Describe how the agency costs of debt and equity are related to options.
Agency conflicts arise between stockholders and lenders (creditors and bondholders) and between stockholders and managers because the interests of stockholders, lenders, and managers are not perfectly aligned. In fact, their interests can differ greatly. One reason is that the claims that they have against the cash flows produced by the firm have payoff functions that look like different types of options. We now discuss how these payoff functions lead to agency conflicts and their related costs.

Agency Costs of Debt
In Chapter 16, we discussed agency costs that arise in a company that uses debt financing. We noted that these costs occur because the incentives of people who lend to a company differ from those of the stockholders. If you reread those discussions now, you will probably notice that the problems we discussed arise because the payoff functions for stockholders and lenders differ like those for the different options we have been discussing in this chapter.

To understand why this is the case, consider a company that has a single loan outstanding. This loan will mature next year, and all of the interest and principal will be due at that time. Now, consider what happens when the debt matures. If the value of the company is less than the amount owed on the debt, the stockholders will simply default, and the lenders will take control of the assets of the company. The stockholder claims will be worth $0 in this case. If, however, the value of the company is greater than the amount owed on the loan, the stockholders will pay off the loan and retain control of the assets. In this case, the stockholder claims will be worth the difference between the value of the firm and the amount owed to the lenders.

In other words, the payoff function for the stockholders looks exactly like that for the owner of a call option, where the exercise price is the amount owed on the loan and the underlying asset is the firm itself. If the value of the firm exceeds the exercise price, the stockholders will choose to exercise their option; and if it does not exceed the exercise price, they will let their option expire unexercised. Figure A of Exhibit 20.4 illustrates the payoff function for the stockholders in this example.

The payoff function for the lenders in our example is illustrated in Figure B of Exhibit 20.4. If the value of the firm is less than the amount owed, the lenders receive only the assets of the firm; and if the value of the firm is greater than the amount owed, the lenders receive only the amount owed. One way to think about the payoff function for the lenders is that when they lend money to the firm, they are essentially selling a put option to the stockholders.5 This option gives the stockholders the right to “put” the assets to the lenders with an exercise price that equals the amount they owe. When the value of the firm is less than the exercise price, the stockholders will exercise their option by defaulting. Of course, the stockholders are able to default and walk away only because our bankruptcy laws limit their liability to the amount that they have invested in the company.

The Dividend Payout Problem

Knowing that debt and equity claims are like options in which the underlying asset is the firm, we can use the intuition gained from the discussion of the determinants of option value to better understand the agency costs of debt. As noted in the previous section, bankruptcy laws limit stockholder losses to what they have invested in the company. The option to default and “put” the assets to the lenders thus gives stockholders at a company facing bankruptcy an incentive to pay themselves cash dividends. Once paid, the dividends are protected by the bankruptcy laws. At the same time, the dividend payment lowers the value of assets available for the lenders. The net effect is to transfer value to stockholders at the expense of the lenders. If the firm goes bankrupt and the lenders end up receiving, for example, 50 percent or 80 percent of what they are owed, it will make no difference to the stockholders, who will get nothing from the liquidation of the company’s assets in either case.

EXHIBIT 20.4 Payoff Functions for Stockholders and Lenders


The Asset Substitution Problem

In Chapter 16, we saw that when bankruptcy is possible, stockholders have an incentive to invest in very risky projects, some of which might even have negative NPVs. Stockholders have this incentive because they receive all of the benefits if things turn out well, but do not bear all of the costs if things turn out poorly. Since equity claims are like call options on the assets of the firm, this asset substitution problem should not be surprising. We pointed out earlier in this chapter that the more volatile the value of the underlying asset, the more valuable a call option on that asset will be. Stockholders of leveraged firms know this and therefore have an incentive to invest in risky projects that increase the overall volatility of the value of their companies’ assets.

Lenders, in contrast, do not want the firm to invest in high-risk projects. As you can see from their payoff function in Exhibit 20.4, the lenders bear costs as the value of the firm drops below the amount they are owed, but do not benefit at all as the value of the firm’s assets increases above that amount. Lenders to companies that are worth more than they are owed can only expect to lose when a project increases the overall riskiness of a company’s assets.

The Underinvestment Problem

Chapter 16 also explained that stockholders have incentives to turn down positive NPV projects when all of the benefits are likely to go to the lenders. You can see how this underinvestment problem arises from the differences in the payoff functions in Exhibit 20.4. Suppose that the company will owe $10 million when the loan matures, that the company is currently worth $5 million, and that the loan matures next week. This company is financially distressed because its assets are not even worth as much as its outstanding debt—so it is unlikely to have enough money to finance new investments. Now suppose that management identifies a positive NPV project that would require a $3 million investment and that has a positive NPV of $1 million that will be realized before the debt payment must be made. Management would have a hard time convincing the stockholders to invest an additional $3 million in the firm, because even if the investment turns out to be worth $4 million, all of the money will go to the lenders. The stockholders have a strong incentive to turn down this positive NPV project.

Agency Costs of Equity
Many of our discussions assume that managers act in the best interests of the stockholders. Since managers are hired to manage the firm on behalf of the stockholders, this might appear to be a reasonable assumption. However, as you already know, managers do not always act in the stockholders’ best interest. This is because the payoff function for a manager can be quite different from that for stockholders. In fact, a manager’s payoff function can look a lot like a lender’s payoff function.

To see how this is possible, consider the connection between managers’ personal wealth and the performance of the companies for which they work. The present value of a manager’s future earnings is a large part of his or her overall wealth. If a company gets into financial distress and a manager is viewed as responsible, that manager could lose his or her job and find it difficult to obtain a similar job at another company. So as long as a company is able to avoid defaulting on its debt, a manager has a reasonable chance of retaining his or her job. Once the firm defaults, the chances of job loss increase dramatically. In addition, researchers have found that senior managers of financially distressed large public companies who lose their jobs find it difficult to obtain similar jobs afterward.6 We might also expect that the worse the company’s financial distress, the worse the manager’s future employment prospects and the lower the present value of the compensation that he or she can expect to receive in the future. If this is so, when the value of a firm is less than the amount it owes, the payoff function for a manager will look something like that for the lender in Figure B of Exhibit 20.4—it will slope downward as the value of the firm decreases.

On the positive side, we would expect the present value of a manager’s future earnings to increase with the value of the firm when this value is above the amount that the company owes to its lenders. Managers will receive larger bonuses and larger pay raises, and any stock or options that they receive will be more valuable. However, these increases will not be nearly as large as those for stockholders. The stockholders are not likely to give the managers a large proportion of any increase in firm value. The net result is that the payoff function for managers can look something like the one in Exhibit 20.5.

The fact that the payoff function for a manager resembles that for a lender means that managers, like lenders, have incentives to invest in less risky assets and to distribute less value through dividends and stock repurchases than the stockholders would like them to. Because the likelihood of financial distress increases with leverage, managers also have incentives to use less debt than stockholders would like them to. These tendencies are reinforced by the fact that managers are individuals who do not hold diversified portfolios, since most of their wealth is tied to the performance of their firms. Managers tend to make conservative investment, payout, and financing decisions because the cost to them of failure can be very large.

EXHIBIT 20.5 Representative Payoff Function for a Manager The payoff function for a manager with a typical compensation arrangement is more similar in shape to the payoff function for a lender than for a stockholder. While a stockholder’s payoff function is flat to the left of the face value of the debt, the value of the manager’s compensation is downward sloping, much like the payoff for a lender. When the value of the firm is greater than the face value of the debt, the value of the manager’s compensation does not increase as much as the value of the firm’s shares (the line in the payoff function is not as steep). Because managers’ payoff functions differ from those for stockholders, managers have incentives to take actions that are not in the best interests of stockholders.


Boards of directors understand how the incentives of managers differ from those of stockholders. Consequently, boards put a great deal of effort into designing compensation plans that make the payoff functions for managers look as much as possible like those of stockholders. Ultimately, this is a key to minimizing agency conflicts between stockholders and the managers who represent them.

20.5 Options and Risk Management
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain how options can be used to manage a firm’s exposure to risk.
We have discussed options that are bundled with financial securities, how options found in real investments can have value, and how the option-like payoff functions of stockholders, lenders, and managers contribute to agency conflicts. Another place in which options are frequently encountered in corporate finance is in the management of risk. Risk management involves hedging, or reducing the financial risks faced by a firm. Options, along with other derivative securities, such as forwards, futures, and swaps, are used to reduce risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices.

To see how risks can be managed using options, consider an oil company that is producing and selling oil to refiners. Suppose that the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has recently risen above $90 per barrel and the company wants to make sure that, even if prices drop below $85 per barrel, it will receive at least $85 for each barrel of WTI oil that it sells during the next three months. If the company plans to sell 100,000 barrels of oil in the next three months, the financial managers can hedge the price risk by purchasing put options on 100,000 barrels of oil with an exercise price of $85 per barrel plus the cost of the options. The maturity dates on the options must be selected to match the timing of the company’s oil output over the next three months. In addition, the actual exercise prices on the options must be slightly greater than $85 to account for the premiums that the company pays to purchase the options. This will ensure that the company actually receives $85 per barrel after paying for the options.

One interesting benefit of using options in this way is that they provide downside protection but do not limit the upside to the company if oil prices continue to increase. Put options give the company the right to sell its oil for the exercise price if prices fall, but because there is no obligation to sell, the company can still benefit if oil prices increase. As discussed earlier, this is just like buying insurance. In fact, many insurance contracts are really little more than specialized put options.

In addition to using options and other derivative securities to manage commodity price risks, as in the oil company example, companies can use these securities to manage risks associated with changing interest rates. Large swings in interest rates can cause a great deal of volatility in the net income of a highly financially leveraged company whose managers rely on floating-rate debt. As interest rates go up and down, the company’s interest expense also goes up and down. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, this volatility can actually increase the company’s taxes.

Options can also be used to manage risks associated with foreign exchange rates. For example, as we discuss in Chapter 21, the revenues that a U.S. company reports can be affected by changes in exchange rates if the company manufactures products in the United States and has overseas sales. If the dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, for example, the company will have to increase the overseas prices of its products in order to maintain the same dollar prices per unit. This, in turn, can prompt consumers in overseas markets to purchase fewer of the company’s products. By using options and other derivative securities to protect against exchange rate movements, managers can limit declines in revenues that occur because of such movements.

Finally, options can be used to manage risks associated with equity prices. This is especially important to companies that have traditional defined-benefit pension plans, which provide retirees with guaranteed retirement payments. Companies are required to put money aside to cover the costs of these payments, and this money is generally invested in stocks. When the stock market declines significantly, these companies must replace any lost value with new contributions, which must come from earnings. As you might expect, managers are very interested in managing the risk that they will have to make these contributions.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Define a call option and a put option, and describe the payoff function for each of these options.

An option is the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset for a given price on or before a specific date. The price is called the exercise or strike price, and the date is called the exercise date or expiration date of the option. The right to buy the asset is known as a call option. The payoff from a call option equals $0 if the value of the underlying asset is less than or equal to the exercise price at expiration. If the value of the underlying asset is greater than the exercise price at expiration, then the payoff from a call option is equal to the value of the underlying asset value minus the exercise price. The right to sell the asset is called a put option. The payoff from a put option is $0 if the value of the underlying asset is greater than or equal to the exercise price at expiration. If the value of the underlying asset is less than the exercise price, then the payoff from a put option equals the exercise price minus the value of the underlying asset.

2 List and describe the variables that affect the value of an option. Calculate the value of a call option and of a put option.

The value of an option is affected by five variables: the current price of the underlying asset, the exercise price of the option, the volatility of the value of the underlying asset, the time left until the expiration of the option, and the risk-free rate.

Section 20.2 describes how to calculate the values of call and put options, both at expiration and at some point before the expiration date.

3 Identify some of the real options that occur in business, and explain why traditional NPV analysis does not accurately incorporate their values.

Real options that are associated with investments include options to defer the investments, make follow-on investments, change operations, and abandon projects. Traditional NPV analysis is designed to make a decision to accept or reject a project at a particular point in time. It is not designed to incorporate potential value associated with deferring the investment decision. Incorporating the value of the other real options into an NPV framework is technically possible but would be very difficult to do because the rate used to discount the cash flows would change over time with their riskiness. In addition, the information necessary to value real options using the NPV approach is not always available.

4 Describe how the agency costs of debt and equity are related to options.

The chapter discusses two classes of agency conflicts. The first is between stockholders (owners) and lenders. When there is a risk of bankruptcy, stockholders may have incentives to increase the volatility of the firm’s assets, turn down positive NPV projects, or pay out assets in the form of dividends. Stockholders have these incentives because their payoff functions look like those for the owner of a call option.

The other class of agency conflicts is between managers and stockholders. Managers tend to prefer less risk than stockholders. They have incentives to invest in less risky projects and use less debt financing than stockholders would like them to. Managers also prefer to distribute fewer assets in the form of dividends or through stock repurchases because their payoff functions are more like those of lenders than those of stockholders. These preferences are magnified by the fact that managers are risk-averse individuals whose portfolios are not well diversified.

5 Explain how options can be used to manage a firm’s exposure to risk.

A company can adjust its exposure to risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices by buying or selling options. For example, a company that is concerned about a decline in the prices it will receive for products that will be delivered in the future can purchase put options to partially or totally eliminate that risk.

Discussion Questions
20.1 Options can be combined to create more complicated payoff structures. Consider the combination of one put option and one call option with the same expiration date and the same strike price. Draw the payoff diagram, and describe what the purchaser of such a combination thinks will happen before expiration.

20.2 A writer (seller) of a call option may or may not actually own the underlying asset. If he or she owns the asset, and therefore will have the asset available to deliver should the option be exercised, he or she is said to be writing a covered call. Otherwise, he or she is writing a naked call and will have to buy the underlying asset on the open market should the option be exercised. Draw the payoff diagram of a covered call (including the value of the owned underlying asset) and compare it with the payoff of other options.

20.3 An American option will never be worth less than a European option. Evaluate this statement.

20.4 Explain why, in the binomial pricing theory, the probabilities of an upward move versus a downward move are not important.

20.5 Like all other models, the binomial pricing model is a simplification of reality. In this model, how do we represent high volatility or low volatility of the value of the underlying asset?

20.6 What kinds of real options should be considered in the following situations?

Wingnuts R Us is considering two sites for a new factory. One is just large enough for the planned facility, while the other is three times larger.
Carousel Cruises is purchasing three new cruise ships to be built sequentially. The first ship will commence construction today and will take one year to build. The second will then be started. Carousel can cancel the order for a given cruise ship at any time before construction begins.
20.7 Future Enterprises is considering building a factory that will include an option to expand operations in three years. If things go well, the expansion will have an expected value of $10 million and will cost $2 million to undertake. Otherwise, the expansion will have an expected value of only $1 million and will not take place. What information would we need in order to analyze this capital budgeting problem using the traditional NPV approach that we would not need using option valuation techniques?

20.8 Corporations frequently include employee stock options as a part of the compensation for their managers and sometimes for all of their employees. These options allow the holder to buy the stock of the company for a prespecified price like any other option, but they are usually very long lived, with maturities of 10 years. The goal of stock option plans is to align the incentives of employees with those of stockholders. What are the implications of these compensation plans for current stockholders?

20.9 You own ABC Corp. bonds. Using option pricing theory, explain what agency concerns you would have if ABC were in danger of bankruptcy.

20.10 A bond covenant is a part of a bond contract that restricts the behavior of the firm, barring it from taking certain actions. Using the terminology of options, explain why a bond contract might include a covenant preventing the firm from making large dividend payments to its stockholders.

20.26 Consider the following payoff diagram.


Find a combination of calls, puts, risk-free bonds, and stock that has this payoff. (You need not use all of these instruments, and there are many possible solutions.)

20.27 Consider the payoff structures of the following two portfolios:

Buying a one-month call option on one share of stock at a strike price of $50 and saving the present value of $50 (so that at expiration it will have grown to $50 with interest).

20.28 One way to extend the binomial pricing model is by including multiple time periods. Suppose Splittime, Inc., is currently trading for $100 per share. In one month, the price will either increase by $10 (to $110) or decrease by $10 (to $90). The following month will be the same. The price will either increase by $10 or decrease by $10. Notice that in two months, the price could be $120, $100, or $80. The risk-free rate is 1 percent per month. Find the value today of an option to buy one share of Splittime in two months for a strike price of $105. (Hint: To do this, first find the possible values of the option at the end of the second month. Then use those values as the payoffs to find the value today.)

20.29 SpinTheWheel Co. has assets currently worth $10 million in the form of one-year, risk-free bonds that will return 10 percent. The company has debt with a face value of $5.5 million due in one year. (No interest payments will be made.) The stockholders decided to sell $8 million of the risk-free bonds and to invest the money in a very risky venture. This venture consists of giving Mr. William Kid the money now and, in one year, flipping a coin. If it comes up heads, Mr. Kid will pay SpinTheWheel $17.6 million. If it comes up tails, SpinTheWheel gets nothing. This investment has an NPV of zero.

20.32 Husky Motors has two debt issues outstanding, both of which mature in five years. The senior debt issue, which has a face value of $10 million, must be paid in full before any of the principal for the junior debt issue is paid. The junior debt issue also has a face value of $10 million. Draw the payoff diagrams for Husky’s equity and both debt issues as the value of the firm changes. Under what circumstances would you expect to see conflicts between the senior and junior debt holders?

20.33 The payoff function for the holder of straight debt looks like that for the seller of a put option. Convertible debt is straight debt plus a call option on a firm’s stock. How does the addition of a call option to straight debt affect the concern that lenders have about the asset substitution problem, and why?

Sample Test Problems
20.1 You own a call option on Pepsico stock with a strike price of $60 per share that expires in 60 days. The current market price of Pepsico stock is $63.50 per share. What are the limits on the value of the call option you own?

20.2 Assume that the current market price of Montrose Industrials stock is $28 per share and that the price will either rise to $38 per share or fall to $21 per share in one month. The risk-free rate for one month is 1 percent. What is the value of a one-month call option with a strike price of $24 per share?

20.3 The market value of General Motors stock is currently $53.73 per share, and the annual risk-free rate is 3 percent. A three-month call option on the stock with a strike price of $55 sells for $2.15. What is the value of a put option on General Motors stock that has the same strike price and expiration date if there are no arbitrage opportunities?

20.4 Why is it hard to account for real options in an NPV analysis?

20.5 Fuel costs are a significant fraction of total costs in the airline industry. How might airline managers use options to manage fuel costs? What is the downside of doing this?

Notes
1 Even if the value of the option fell below the line to the right of the exercise price in Figure A of Exhibit 20.1, it would not stay there. This is because investors would be able to make an instant profit by buying the option, exercising it to get the underlying asset, and then selling the underlying asset. Such trading by investors would drive the price of the option back above the line.
2 We are focusing in this discussion on what the value of the underlying asset is likely to be immediately before the option expires because it does not generally make sense to exercise an option before its expiration date as long as there is a chance that the value of the underlying asset could increase further. An exception is when the value of the underlying asset is not expected to be higher as the expiration of the option nears because value is being distributed to the owners of the underlying asset (for example, through dividend payments). In a situation like this, it can be appropriate to exercise a call option immediately before such a distribution. There are also situations where it is advantageous to exercise a put option early. Such situations can arise if the value of the underlying asset is $0 before expiration. When this happens, the value received from exercising the option today can exceed the present value of the amount that is expected to be received if the option is exercised immediately before expiration.
3 There are other ways to solve the binomial pricing problem than by actually finding an equivalent portfolio. While they differ in their calculation, the underlying concepts are identical. See any advanced investments textbook for details.
4 An exception exists where a contractual agreement prevents the project from being terminated without payment of a penalty that is equivalent to the remaining value of the project.
5 This payoff function is actually like that from the combination of selling a put option and buying a risk-free loan. Lenders receive the face value of the loan from the risk-free bond, but they might have to pay some or all of that value in losses on the put option. Since the risk-free loan payout is unaffected by changes in the value of the firm, it does not affect the discussion above.

Explain how large U.S. money center banks make and price Eurocredit loans to their customers, and compute the cost of a Eurocredit bank loan.
Founded in 1964, Nike Incorporated has grown to be one of the most recognizable consumer brands in the world. Many of the company’s products are closely tied to sporting legends, including Tiger Woods, who headlines their golf apparel line, and Michael Jordan and his famed “Air Jordan” basketball shoes. The company, based in Beaverton, Oregon, employs more than 75,000 people and is one of the largest retailers of athletic shoes, apparel, and sports equipment. In 2020, the company recorded over $38 billion in sales, and according to its annual report, $22.8 billion of those sales were to customers outside of the United States. To support its operations, Nike maintains branch offices in over 50 countries.

Managing the financial aspects of such a large and complex multinational organization poses tremendous challenges. In 2020, the company’s footwear was manufactured in 122 different factories in 12 different countries, while its apparel line was produced in 329 factories in 38 countries. Approximately 50 percent of its footwear is made by producers in Vietnam, and much of the manufacturing and labor costs for this production are paid in the Vietnamese currency known as the dong. Most of these shoes, however, are sold outside Vietnam in a variety of different countries and currencies. As a result, the profitability of Nike can vary due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the dong and various other currencies and also between the dong and the U.S. dollar, the currency in which Nike reports its financial results. If Nike executives don’t take actions that limit the effects of changes in currency exchange rates on the company’s profits, these changes can make financing the business more difficult and can adversely affect the company’s stock price.

Capital budgeting is also more demanding in a multinational firm. Forecasting sales for numerous countries is much more difficult than forecasting only domestic demand for a company’s products. An analyst must understand the key factors that will drive foreign product demand, including demographic, cultural, and regulatory factors as well as general economic conditions. In addition, production location decisions, supply chain considerations, and inventory management can be quite complex for firms with operations across the globe, making costs more difficult to estimate. Countries also have unique political and financial risk factors. For example, Singapore is widely recognized as a country with a very stable political system and a reliable rule of law. This makes it easier for businesses to make long-run investments in the country and to obtain capital from local banks. At the other end of the spectrum, countries with political conflict and economic discord, such as Venezuela and Greece, present extreme challenges for multinational firms.

Financing a multinational company like Nike is also complex. Multinational firms typically raise capital in different regions of the world. This requires that financial managers understand international finance and have a working knowledge of foreign financial markets. Financial managers must also maintain banking relationships in the various countries in which they operate to ensure that their firms have adequate working capital to support their operations. This chapter discusses these and other challenges associated with the financial management of multinational firms.

Chapter Preview
So far, we have focused on doing business in the United States, yet a large proportion of U.S. companies today engage in international business transactions. This chapter provides an introduction to international financial management.

The goal of financial management is the same abroad as it is at home—to maximize the value of the firm. Thus, the financial manager’s job is to seek out international business opportunities in which the value of the expected cash flows exceeds their cost. If this is done, the firm’s international activities will increase the overall value of the firm.

We start the chapter by providing some background information about the globalization of the world economy, the rise of multinational corporations, and the key factors that distinguish domestic from international business transactions. We emphasize that the basic principles of finance remain valid for international business transactions, even though some of the variables used in financial models change. We also introduce two risks that are not present in domestic business transactions: foreign exchange rate risk and country risk.

We follow this with discussions of markets for foreign currency exchange and how firms protect themselves from fluctuations in exchange rates. We then explain how multinational firms manage their overseas capital investments and compute the NPVs for these projects.

We next turn our attention to global money and capital markets. We pay particular attention to the Euromarket, where large multinational companies adjust their liquidity, borrow short term from banks in the Eurocredit market, and borrow long term in the international bond markets. Finally, we discuss how banks price and structure Eurocredits.

21.1 Introduction to International Financial Management
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Discuss how the basic principles of finance apply to international financial transactions.
Businesses operate in a far different world today than they did only a generation or two ago. Because of the globalization of the world economy, management—including financial management—has changed in many respects. Yet, as you will see, the goals and principles of financial management remain essentially the same.

Globalization of the World Economy
Over the past 50 years, we have witnessed the globalization of business and financial markets. Globalization refers to the removal of barriers to free trade and the integration of national economies. Large corporations often generate more than half of their sales revenue in countries other than the one in which they are based. For example, almost two-thirds of McDonald’s revenue is generated from countries other than the United States. As you read the Wall Street Journal or the business section of any major newspaper, you will see numerous reminders that we live in a globalized world economy.

globalization the removal of barriers to free trade and the integration of national economies

As consumers, Americans routinely purchase clothing and shoes made in China, oil from Canada, automobiles from Germany, pasta and high-fashion shoes from Italy, wines from France, coffee from Brazil, TV sets from South Korea, and textiles from India. Foreigners, in turn, purchase American-made aircraft, medical technology, software, movies, music, wheat, beef, lumber, and many other products.

The production of goods and services has also become highly globalized. As large multinational companies have emerged, the economies of the world have become increasingly interdependent. Most multinational companies have integrated sales and production operations in a dozen or more countries. These firms seek to purchase components and locate production where costs are lower to generate higher margins. For example, personal computers manufactured by U.S.-based firms such as Dell and HP are sold worldwide and may be assembled in Malaysia or China, with monitors and hard drives made in Vietnam, computer chips made in the Taiwan, keyboards made in Korea, and software produced in India.

Like product markets, the financial system has also become highly integrated. Much of the impetus for financial integration came from the governments of the major Asian and Western nations as they began deregulating their foreign exchange markets, money and capital markets, and banking systems.

The Rise of Multinational Corporations
A major factor driving globalization of the world economy is direct investment by multinational corporations. A multinational corporation is a business firm that operates in more than one country. These corporations engage in traditional lines of business, such as manufacturing, mining, gas and oil, and agriculture, as well as consulting, accounting, law, telecommunications, and hospitality. They may purchase raw materials from one country, obtain financing from a capital market in another country, produce finished goods with labor and capital equipment from a third country, and sell finished goods in a number of other countries.

multinational corporation a business firm that operates in more than one country

Multinationals are owned by a mixture of domestic and foreign stockholders. In fact, the ownership of some firms is so widely dispersed that they are known as transnational corporations. Transnational corporations, regardless of the location of their headquarters, are managed from a global perspective rather than the perspective of a firm residing in a particular country. This fact has made them politically controversial because they are viewed as stateless corporations with no allegiance or social responsibility to any nation or region of the world. An example of a transnational firm is Royal Dutch Shell.

transnational corporation a multinational firm that has widely dispersed ownership and that is managed from a global perspective

Exhibit 21.1 lists the largest 15 multinational firms ranked by their total worldwide revenues in 2019. Royal Dutch Shell is the fifth largest of this group with $352.1 billion in revenue. As you can see, most of the firms on the list are household names. By country of origin, 7 of the largest 15 firms are headquartered in the United States, with the balance in China, Japan, Europe, and Saudi Arabia.

Factors Affecting International Financial Management
As we suggested earlier, most of the basic finance principles discussed in this book apply to international financial management. However, six factors can cause international business transactions to differ from domestic transactions. We look at these factors next.

EXHIBIT 21.1 The World’s Largest Multinational Firms Ranked by 2019 Revenue

Many of the world’s 15 largest multinational firms are household names; 7 of the top 15 are based in the United States, with the balance located in China, Japan, Europe, and Saudi Arabia.

Currency Differences

Most sovereign nations have their own currencies. Thus, businesses that engage in international transactions are likely to deal in two or more currencies. If this is the case, financial managers need to know how unexpected fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect the firm’s cash flows and, hence, the value of the firm. The uncertainty of future exchange rate movements is called foreign exchange rate risk, or just exchange rate risk, and we discuss it later in this chapter.

foreign exchange rate risk, or exchange rate risk the uncertainty associated with future currency exchange rate movements

Differences in Legal Systems and Tax Codes

Differences in legal systems and tax codes can also impact the way firms operate in foreign countries. Some countries, including the United States, Canada, and India, operate under legal systems derived from British common law, whereas Western European countries such as France, Germany, and Italy have legal systems derived from the French Napoleonic codes. Chinese law and other Asian legal systems evolved over centuries, with an emphasis on moral teaching and legally stipulated punishments.

What emerges from the world’s legal systems and tax codes is a patchwork of different systems that can vary substantially from country to country and can affect how foreign business firms are treated within a particular country’s borders. Legal systems can vary on simple matters, such as the requirements for opening a business, selecting a site location, and hiring employees, as well as more complex matters, such as the taxation of companies and dividends, the rights and legal liabilities of ownership, and the resolution of business conflicts. Thus, legal and tax differences can affect financial decisions concerning what assets to acquire, how to organize the firm, and what capital structure to use.

Language Differences

There are two important levels of communication in international business: business communication and social communication. Most multinational negotiations and legal contracts use English. English is the language of choice for international business throughout much of the world. Thus, reading and speaking fluent English are necessary skills for anyone planning to be a senior manager in a multinational corporation.

English is not, however, the world’s social language—the language spoken when important social relationships that build trust are formed. Local languages are important for social relationships. For example, suppose that you are the CEO of an American food-processing firm and you are negotiating a deal to manufacture food products in Guangzhou, China (about 60 miles from Hong Kong). You are partnering with a Dutch firm that you know well. During the day, business and contract negotiations are conducted in English. Most members of the management team will probably speak English as well as Chinese or Dutch.

At the traditional Chinese business dinner banquets, however, the preferred social language will be Cantonese, a regional Chinese dialect. Needless to say, those who speak only English in this situation will be at a disadvantage. Historically, most U.S. business executives have spoken only English; however, this is changing rapidly as more U.S. executives receive overseas assignments and business students recognize the importance of a second language.

Cultural Differences

Culture is defined as the socially transmitted behavior patterns, beliefs, and attitudes of a group. Cultural views and attitudes are powerful forces that bind people together and define a particular society. The cultures of different countries, and even different regions within the same country, can vary considerably.

Cultural views also shape business practices and people’s attitudes toward business. For example, in Germany business firms are generally expected to have less debt in their capital structure than is typical for comparable firms in the United States. Other areas of business that differ by culture are willingness to assume risk, management style, tolerance for inflation, and attitude toward race, gender, and business failure.

Differences in Economic Systems

An economic system determines how a country mobilizes its resources to produce goods and services needed by society, as well as how the production is distributed. In the twentieth century, two basic economic systems competed for government endorsement: (1) centrally planned economies and (2) market economies.

In a centrally planned economy, resources are allocated, produced, and distributed under the direction of the central government, as in the former Soviet Union. These economies have no financial markets or banking systems to allocate capital flows. The central government sets interest rates and foreign exchange rates, and financial managers need not worry about capital budgeting decisions because capital resources are allocated centrally.

In market economies, resources are allocated, produced, and distributed by market forces rather than by government decree. Market economies have proven to be much more efficient in producing goods and services than centrally planned economies. This fact is borne out by current trends in what once were the two largest centrally planned in the world: the Soviet Union and China. With the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the countries that comprised the union, including Russia, adopted many of the features of market-based economies. China, maintains an economic system frequently referred to as a socialist market economy in which private capitalist enterprises co-exist with state-owned and controlled companies.

Differences in Country Risk

Sovereign nations are usually free to place or remove constraints on businesses.1 At the extreme, a country’s government may even expropriate (take over) a business’s assets within the country. These types of actions clearly can affect a firm’s cash flows and, thus, the value of the firm. Country risk refers to political uncertainty associated with a particular country. We discuss country risk in more detail later in this chapter.

country risk the political uncertainty associated with a particular country

Goals of International Financial Management
Throughout this book, we have argued that maximization of firm value is the proper goal for management to pursue. Maximizing firm value will generate the greatest amount of wealth for a firm’s stockholders, which is the accepted goal for firms in the United States, as well as in other countries that share a similar heritage, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, India, and Canada. However, it is not a widely embraced goal in other parts of the world. In Continental Europe, for example, countries such as France and Germany focus on maximizing corporate wealth. This means that stockholders are treated no differently from stakeholders, such as management, labor, suppliers, creditors, and even the government. The European manager’s goal is to create as much wealth as possible while considering the overall welfare of both the stockholders and stakeholders. In Japan, companies form tightly knit, interlocking business groups called keiretsu, such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo.The goal of the Japanese business manager in these groups is to increase the wealth and growth of the keiretsu. As a result, the manager might focus on maximizing market share rather than stockholder value.

In China there are sharp differences between state-owned companies and emerging private-sector firms. The large state-owned companies have an overall goal that can best be described as maintaining full employment in the economy. In contrast, private-sector firms embrace the standard of stockholder value maximization, but are tightly regulated by the government.

Basic Principles Remain the Same
Building Intuition
The Basic Principles of Finance Apply No Matter Where You Do Business

The principles of finance do not stop at international borders. They apply no matter where the firm is headquartered or where it operates. Although basic finance principles do not change, international financial managers must contend with complications stemming from factors such as differences in accounting standards and tax codes, differences in interest rates, the presence of foreign exchange rate risk and country risk, and cultural differences.

In today’s globalized environment, financial managers must be prepared to handle international transactions and all the complexities that those transactions involve. Fortunately, the basic principles of finance remain the same whether a transaction is domestic or international. The time value of money, for example, is not affected by whether a business transaction is domestic or international. Likewise, we use the same models for valuing capital assets, bonds, stocks, and entire firms.

The things that do change are some of the input variables used to make financial calculations. For example, required rates of return often differ between countries, and the appropriate rate must be used. Similarly, cash flows may be stated in terms of home or foreign currency. Tax codes and accounting standards also differ across countries. Exhibit 21.2 lists some of the important finance concepts and procedures discussed in the first 20 chapters of this book and indicates where there are differences between domestic and international operations.

EXHIBIT 21.2 The Basic Principles of Finance Apply in International Finance

Most of the basic finance principles discussed in this book remain unchanged in the international context. Where there are differences, they generally result from differences in accounting standards, tax codes, legal and regulatory systems, monetary systems, interest rates, and cultural norms.

21.2 Foreign Exchange Markets
Learning Objective

Differentiate among the spot rate, the forward rate, and the cross rate in the foreign exchange markets, perform foreign exchange and cross rate calculations, and hedge an asset purchase where payment is made in a foreign currency.
The foreign exchange markets are international markets where currencies are bought and sold in wholesale amounts. Foreign exchange markets provide three basic economic benefits:

foreign exchange markets international markets where currencies are bought and sold in wholesale amounts

A mechanism to transfer purchasing power from individuals who deal in one currency to individuals who deal in a different currency, facilitating the import and export of goods and services.
A way for corporations to pass the risk associated with foreign exchange price fluctuations to professional risk-takers. This hedging function is particularly important to corporations in the present era of floating, or variable, exchange rates.
A channel for importers and exporters to acquire credit for international business transactions. The time span between the shipment of goods by exporters and their receipt by importers can be considerable. While the goods are in transit, they must be financed. Foreign exchange markets provide a mechanism through which financing and currency conversions can be accomplished efficiently and at low cost.
The foreign exchange markets are very large, with an average daily volume reaching more than $6.6 trillion in 2020. This is more than the value of all the cars, wheat, oil, and other products sold daily in the real economy. London is by far the largest foreign exchange trading center, with New York City, Hong Kong, and Singapore being other important locations for foreign exchange trade. In this section, we examine how the foreign exchange markets are structured and how they work.

Market Structure and Major Participants
There is no single formal foreign exchange market. Rather, as suggested earlier, there is a group of informal markets that are closely interlocked through international banking relationships. Participants are linked by electronic networks. The market trades any time of day or night and every day of the year. Virtually every country has some type of active foreign exchange market.

The major participants in the foreign exchange markets are multinational commercial banks, large investment banking firms, and currency boutiques that specialize in foreign exchange transactions. In the United States, the market is dominated by money center banks, including Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Bank of America. The other major participants are the central banks, which intervene in the markets primarily to smooth out fluctuations in the exchange rates for their countries’ currencies.

Foreign Exchange Rates
When U.S.-based firms buy raw materials or finished goods, they want to get the best possible deal—the quality they need at the lowest price. When suppliers are located in the United States, comparisons of the alternatives are quite easy. Both the supplier and the customer keep their books and pay their bills in the same currency—U.S. dollars.

When the suppliers are not located in the United States, comparisons are more difficult. American buyers prefer to pay for purchases in dollars, but the foreign supplier must pay employees and other local expenses with its domestic currency. Hence, one of the two parties in the transaction will be forced to deal in a foreign currency and incur foreign exchange rate risk (recall that this risk arises because of the uncertainty associated with future exchange rate movements).

Fortunately, we can easily compare prices stated in different currencies by checking the foreign exchange rate quotes in major newspapers or on the Internet. A foreign exchange rate is the price of one monetary unit, such as the British pound, stated in terms of another currency, such as the U.S. dollar.

As an example, assume that you are the CFO of a U.S.-based manufacturing firm and you can buy American steel at $660.00 per ton and British steel for £496 per ton. Furthermore, a Japanese company is willing to sell steel for ¥65,895 per ton. Which supplier should you choose? If the exchange rate between dollars and pounds is $1.35/£, meaning that one British pound will cost $1.35, the British steel will cost £496 × $1.35/£ = $669.60. At this dollar price, the American firm will prefer to buy steel from the American supplier at $660.00 per ton. If the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar is ¥102/$, which means that one dollar costs ¥102, the Japanese steel will cost ¥65,895/¥102/$ = $646.03 per ton. This price is $13.97 per ton ($660.00 − $646.03 = $13.97) less than the American supplier’s price of $660.00 per ton. If the price quotation of ¥65,895 includes all transportation costs and tariffs, or if the sum of those costs is less than $13.97 per ton, the American manufacturer will find it cheaper to purchase steel from the Japanese supplier. The first three rows in Exhibit 21.3 show the calculations used to reach this conclusion.

Now suppose that the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound falls from $1.35/£ to $1.30/£. Because the exchange rates for the world’s major currencies float freely, market forces cause fluctuations to occur continuously. At this point, the British steel can be bought for £496 × $1.30/£ = $644.80 (row 4 in Exhibit 21.3). The British firm has become the low-cost supplier, even though it has done nothing itself to lower its price.

EXHIBIT 21.3 Foreign Exchange Rates and the Price of Steel in International Markets

The exhibit shows the calculations necessary to decide which steel supplier offers the best price: American, British, or Japanese. If the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound is $1.35/£ and the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar is ¥102/$, it makes economic sense to select the Japanese supplier. The situation changes when the exchange rate between pound and dollar falls to $1.30/£.

Supplier	Price in Local Currency	Foreign Exchange Rate	Conversion to Price in U.S. Dollars	Price of Steel in U.S. Dollars
American	$660	–	–	$660.00
British	£496	$1.35/£	£496 × $1.35/£ =	$669.60
Japanese	¥65,895	¥102/$	¥65,895/¥102/$ =	$646.03
British	£496	$1.30/£	£496 × $1.30/£ =	$644.80
Notice that it now takes fewer dollars to buy one British pound and, conversely, more pounds to purchase one U.S. dollar. It is correct to say that the value of the pound has fallen against the dollar or that the value of the dollar has risen against the pound. Both statements indicate that goods and services priced in pounds are now cheaper to someone holding dollars and that purchases priced in dollars are now more expensive to someone holding pounds.

Also notice that, other things remaining equal, the demand for a country’s products will be higher when the value of the country’s currency declines relative to the value of other currencies. In our example, the change in the exchange rate led to a reversal of the U.S. company’s purchase decisions; at $1.35/£, British steel was the most expensive, but when the exchange rate fell to $1.30/£, British steel was the cheapest.

Learning by Doing Application 21.1 and Decision Making Example 21.1 present other examples that illustrate exchange rate calculations and the interpretation of exchange rates.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION 21.1
Exchange Rates and the Blue Sweater

Problem

While in a clothing store on Savile Row in London, you find the blue cashmere sweater of your dreams. The sweater is on sale at £250. You say to yourself, “In the states, a sweater like that costs about $300.” If the current exchange rate is $1.38/£, is the sweater’s sale price a bargain relative to what you would pay for it in the United States?





DECISION MAKING EXAMPLE 21.1
Exchange Rate Movement: Good or Bad News?

Situation

You are the purchasing agent for the U.S.-based firm buying steel in the example just discussed in the text and summarized in Exhibit 21.3. Your assistant runs into the office and breathlessly says, “The pound is stronger against the dollar! The new exchange rate is $1.37/£!” Is your assistant’s report good news or bad news?



The Equilibrium Exchange Rate
Exhibit 21.4 shows the supply and demand for British pounds and the equilibrium exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the pound. As you can see, the supply of and demand for pounds move in opposite directions as the exchange rate changes. The demand for pounds increases as the U.S. dollar appreciates in value against the pound. In other words, as pounds become less expensive in relation to dollars, British products become less expensive for Americans to buy. We import more British goods; therefore, we demand more British pounds to pay for those goods. This is illustrated by the downward-sloping demand curve in Exhibit 21.4.

At the same time, the supply of pounds decreases as the dollar price of pounds declines. From the point of view of a British buyer, the lower the dollar price of pounds, the greater the number of pounds that must be given up to obtain dollars to buy foreign (e.g., U.S.) goods. Thus, the lower the dollar price of pounds, the more likely British residents are to switch from imported to domestic products. When purchases are diverted in this way to domestic goods, British residents will supply fewer pounds to the foreign exchange markets because they no longer want to buy as many imports. This is shown by the upward-sloping supply curve in the exhibit.

Exhibit 21.4 also shows the equilibrium exchange rate ($/£), which is at the point where the supply and demand curves intersect and the quantity of the currency demanded exactly equals the quantity supplied. At that rate of exchange, participants in the foreign exchange market will be neither accumulating nor divesting a currency.

The key to understanding movements in exchange rates, then, is to identify factors that cause shifts in the supply and demand curves for foreign currency. In general, whatever causes U.S. residents to buy more or fewer foreign goods shifts the demand curve for the foreign currency. Similarly, whatever causes foreigners to buy more or fewer U.S. goods shifts the supply curve for the foreign currency.

Major currencies such as the British pound and the U.S. dollar are referred to as “floating” currencies in that their exchange rates are allowed to freely fluctuate with supply and demand on the foreign exchange markets. In some cases, however, a country elects to “peg,” or fix, its exchange rate to another major currency, such as the U.S. dollar or the euro. Around the world, over two dozen countries, including Denmark, Togo, and Bulgaria, have opted to peg their currency exchange rates. For example, Bahrain maintains a fixed exchange rate between its dinar and the U.S. dollar of 0.376 dinar per U.S. dollar. Countries typically peg their currency to maintain stability in the exchange rate and to ensure that their goods and services remain competitively priced in export markets.

EXHIBIT 21.4 The Equilibrium Exchange Rate The supply of and demand for pounds move in opposite directions. The equilibrium exchange rate occurs at the intersection of the supply and demand curves. At this point, the quantity of the currency demanded equals the quantity supplied.


Foreign Currency Quotations
Exhibit 21.5 shows selected exchange rate quotations from the Wall Street Journal. As you can see, there are several types of quotations, which we discuss next.

The Spot Rate

Look first at Panel A of the exhibit. The exchange rate quotations here are spot rates. The spot rate is the cost of buying a foreign currency today “on the spot.” In other words, it is the exchange rate that you would pay for immediate delivery of a currency.

spot rate the exchange rate for immediate delivery of a currency

In Panel A, the first column shows the name of the country and the name of its currency. The second and third columns, labeled “USD Equivalent,” show how many U.S. dollars it takes to buy one unit of the foreign currency. Because this rate is the price in dollars for a foreign currency, it is often called the American or direct quote. For example, using the Thursday quote, it takes $1.3688 to buy one British (UK) pound, 19.24 cents to buy one Brazilian real, and 1.368 cents to buy an Indian rupee.

EXHIBIT 21.5 Spot Foreign Exchange Rates and Cross Rates

Panel A lists spot rates for selected currencies. Columns 2 and 3 in Panel A show how many U.S. dollars it takes to buy one unit of the foreign currency, and columns 4 and 5 show how much foreign currency it takes to purchase one U.S. dollar. Panel B of the exhibit shows the cross rates for seven currencies commonly dealt with in the United States.

The fourth and fifth columns in Panel A, labeled “Currency per USD,” show how much foreign currency exchanges for one U.S. dollar. For example, using the Thursday quote, $1 would get you 73.06 U.K. pence (0.7306 pounds), 5.1971 Brazilian reals, or 73.07675 Indian rupees. This quote is often called the European or indirect quote because it is the amount of foreign currency per U.S. dollar (although the foreign currency may not be European). As you may have noted, the second exchange rate is the reciprocal (1/x) of the first. For example, the American quote for the British pound $1.3688/£; the European quote, which is the reciprocal, is 1/1.3688 = 0.7306, or £0.7306/$ (that is, $1 equals £0.7306).

Bid and Ask Rate Quotations

The foreign exchange rate quotes given in the Wall Street Journal are provided by foreign exchange dealers, most of whom operate in large money center banks. Like all dealers in financial markets, foreign exchange dealers quote two prices: bid and ask quotes. The bid quote represents the rate at which the dealer will buy foreign currency, while the ask quote is the rate at which the dealer will sell foreign currency. The prices quoted in the Wall Street Journal are ask quotes for wholesale transactions ($1 million or more).

The difference between the bid and ask price is the dealer’s spread, which is often calculated in percent form, as follows:

(21.1)
Suppose a dealer is quoting a bid rate for euros (the currency of the European Union) of $1.2105/€ and an ask rate of $1.2186/€. The bid-ask spread is 0.665 percent [(1.2186 − 1.2105)/1.2186 = 0.00665, or 0.665 percent]. Now assume that ABC Corporation decides to buy €1,000,000 to use in a transaction. The dealer sells the euros to the company at the ask rate of $1.2186/€, and the firm pays the dealer a total of $1,218,600 (€1,000,000 × $1.2186/€ = $1,218,600). Later in the day, ABC Corporation finds it does not need the euros and decides to sell them back. The dealer buys the euros from the firm at the bid rate of $1.2105/€. The firm receives $1,210,500 (€1,000,000 × $1.2105/€ = $1,210,500). This represents a loss of $8,100, or 0.665 percent ($8,100/$1,218,600 = 0.00665, or 0.665 percent), which is exactly equal to the bid-ask spread calculated above.

Cross Rates

People who have to deal with more than one foreign currency often make use of a table of spot exchange rates called cross rates, which are simply exchange rates between two currencies. Panel B of Exhibit 21.5 shows cross rates for seven different currencies. Cross rate tables can be found in the Wall Street Journal and on many financial Web sites.

It is also possible to calculate cross rates, given enough information. Suppose, for example, that a dealer is interested in finding the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the pound but only knows the exchange rate between each of these currencies and the U.S. dollar: C$1.2652/$ and £0.7309/$. The dealer can calculate the desired cross rate as follows:

Turning to the cross rate table in Panel B of Exhibit 21.5, you can find exactly the same value—1.7310—by looking down the column for the pound and matching it with the Canadian dollar.

Learning by Doing Application 21.2 illustrates another application of cross exchange rates.

Problem

An American executive is going on a business trip to Japan and England. Before she departs, the executive purchases $10,000 worth of Japanese yen at the prevailing rate of ¥103.79/$. After finishing her business in Japan, she departs for London, where she converts her remaining yen to British pounds. She sells ¥512,375 at a rate of ¥141.99/£. She finally returns to the United States with £567.35, which she would like to convert to U.S. dollars. Based only on the rates given, how many dollars will she receive if she sells the pounds?





Forward Rates

For the major world currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the British pound, and the Japanese yen, financial Web sites such as Bloomberg, also list the forward rates for a number of different time frames. Recall that the spot rate is what you pay to buy money today. The forward rate, as the name implies, is what you agree to pay for money in the future—that is, you sign a contract today to buy the money on a date in the future, such as one month, three months, or six months from now.

forward rate a rate agreed on today for an exchange to take place on a specified date in the future

Forward contracts are important because foreign business transactions can extend over long periods. This means that financial managers must anticipate their future needs for foreign currencies. By contracting now to buy or sell foreign currencies at some future date, managers can lock in the cost of foreign exchange at the beginning of a transaction, and do not have to worry about the possibility of an unfavorable movement in the exchange rate before the transaction is completed. This is one way that forward contracts are used by companies to manage risk.

Note that the forward rate is established at the date on which the agreement is made and defines the exchange rate to be used when the transaction is completed in the future. This characteristic is extremely important for facilitating international business transactions, because it permits the two parties to eliminate all uncertainty about the amount of currency to be delivered or received in the future.

The forward rate quoted on a particular day is seldom the same as the spot rate on the same day. Whether it is a one-month, three-month, or six-month quote, the forward rate is the market’s best estimate of what the spot rate will be at that time in the future. The difference between the forward rate and the spot rate is called the forward premium or forward discount. For example, suppose the spot rate today on the British pound is $1.3584/£, while the three-month forward rate is $1.3594/£. According to the forward quote, the market expects the British pound to cost $1.3594 three months in the future, a value that is greater than today’s spot rate of $1.3584/£. Thus, we say that the British pound is at a forward premium against the U.S. dollar, or that the dollar is at a forward discount against the British pound.

This forward premium or discount can be measured as a percentage on an annualized basis. Equation 21.2 shows this relation:

(21.2)
where n is the number of days in the forward agreement. Applying this equation to our example, the forward premium on the pound is equal to:

which is a premium on the pound. If the calculation had resulted in a negative number, it would have indicated a forward discount on the pound.

Learning by Doing Application 21.3 illustrates another forward premium (discount) calculation.

Problem

Ian Chappell is planning a trip from Sydney, Australia, to visit his brother, who works in India. He plans to make the trip in six months. In preparing his budget for the trip, he finds that the spot rate for Indian rupees is Rs54.4811 per Australian dollar (A$). He also finds the six-month forward rate to be Rs50.9001/A$. What is the forward premium or discount on the Indian rupee against the Australian dollar?





Hedging a Currency Transaction

In finance, to hedge means to engage in a financial transaction to reduce risk. In the discussion of forward rates, we briefly described how firms can lock in (hedge) the cost of foreign exchange.

hedge a financial transaction intended to reduce risk

Let’s take a look at an example of how a firm might hedge a transaction using a forward contract. Suppose an American exporter sells farm equipment to a British firm for £100,000; the equipment is to be delivered and paid for in 90 days. The English firm will pay for the purchase in pounds. The American exporter wants to hedge the transaction. How will this hedging work?

If, at the time of the sale, the spot rate is $1.30/£, the farm equipment is worth $130,000 (£100,000 × $1.30/£ = $130,000). However, the actual number of dollars to be received for the machinery, which is the relevant price to the American firm, is not really certain. The American firm must wait 90 days to collect the £100,000 and then sell the pounds in the spot market for dollars. There is a risk that the dollar price of the pound might decline during that time. For instance, if in 90 days a pound is worth only $1.22, the American exporter will receive only $122,000 (£100,000 × $1.22/£ = $122,000), a loss of $8,000 ($130,000 − $122,000 = $8,000).

To ensure a certain future price, the American company can hedge its foreign exchange risk by selling the £100,000 forward 90 days. If the forward rate at the time of sale is $1.28/£, the American exporter can enter into a forward contract in which it agrees to deliver the £100,000 to the bank in 90 days and receive $128,000 (£100,000 × $1.28/£ = $128,000) in return. If the spot rate on the day of the delivery actually turns out to be $1.22/£, the “savings” from hedging is $6,000, since the firm will receive $128,000 instead of the $122,000 it would have received if it had not entered into the forward contract.

Notice that, even with hedging, the firm has “lost” $2,000, because at the time of the sale, when the exchange rate was $1.30/£, the machine was worth $130,000. Can this kind of loss be prevented? The answer is unfortunately, no. Forward contracts cannot protect against expected changes in exchange rates, only against unexpected changes. At the time of sale, the 90-day forward rate is $1.28/£, and this is the market’s best estimate of what the rate will be in 90 days. Of course, in 90 days the spot rate for dollars may be actually $1.28/£, but there is a good chance that it will be either more or less.

What would happen in our example if the spot rate in 90 days rose to $1.40/£? The unhedged transaction would yield $140,000. However, the forward contract would again provide exactly the number of dollars anticipated—$128,000. Although the company may have some regrets because the forward contract prevented it from receiving the benefits of the strengthening pound, most businesses would consider leaving the account receivable exposed (that is, unhedged) to be “speculation.” It is generally believed that foreign exchange speculation is not a logical or legitimate function of nonfinancial businesses that import or export goods or services.

As the details of a forward contract are negotiated between the buyer and the seller, firms can customize both the amount of currency that they want to hedge and the payment date. As an alternative to forward contracts, futures contracts can be used for currency hedging. Futures contracts are similar to forwards in many ways but they cannot be customized. Futures contracts have standardized amounts of currency and pre-specified contract-end dates. Additionally, as they are traded on exchanges, any gains (or losses) on the futures contract are calculated and received (or paid) on a daily basis rather than at the contract end-date.

This can make futures contracts cheaper for companies looking for simple hedging needs.

21.3 International Capital Budgeting
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Identify the major factors that distinguish international from domestic capital budgeting, explain how the capital budgeting process can be adjusted to account for these factors, and compute the NPV for a typical international capital project.
Multinational firms have operations outside of their home countries that range from simple sales offices to large manufacturing operations. As a legal and practical matter, most multinational firms set up separate foreign subsidiaries for each country in which they operate. When a multinational firm wants to consider overseas capital projects, the financial manager faces the decision of which capital projects should be accepted on a company-wide basis.

Fortunately, the overall decision-making framework and computational methods developed for domestic capital budgeting in Chapters 10 through 13 apply to international capital projects as well. Thus, the financial manager’s goal is to seek out domestic and overseas capital projects whose cash flows yield a positive net present value (NPV). The decision to accept international projects with a positive NPV increases the value of the firm and is consistent with the fundamental goal of financial management, which is to maximize the value of stockholder equity.

Furthermore, when financial managers evaluate a capital project overseas, they must estimate the same inputs to compute the NPV for that project that they would for a domestic project: (1) the project’s incremental after-tax free cash flows and (2) the appropriate discount rate. Although the same basic principles apply to both international and domestic capital budgeting, managers must deal with some important differences. We now focus on those differences.

Determining Cash Flows
A number of issues complicate the determination of cash flows from overseas capital projects. First, it is often more difficult to estimate the incremental after-tax free cash flows for foreign projects. Some of the problems stem from the lack of firsthand knowledge by the parent company’s financial staff of procedures and systems used at the overseas operations; other problems arise because of differences in the accounting and legal systems, language, and culture.

Second, foreign subsidiaries can remit cash flows to the parent firm in a number of ways, including (1) cash dividends, (2) royalty or license agreement payments for the use of patents or brand names, and (3) management fees for services the parent provides to a subsidiary. Problems with forecasting expected cash flows can arise when foreign governments restrict the amount of cash that can be repatriated, or returned to the parent company, and therefore moved out of the country. These repatriation of earnings restrictions may arise because foreign governments are politically sensitive to charges that large multinational companies are exploiting their countries and draining vital investment capital from their economies.

repatriation of earnings restrictions restrictions placed by a foreign government on the amount of cash that can be repatriated, or returned to a parent company by a subsidiary doing business in the foreign country

Repatriation of earnings restrictions usually take the form of a ceiling on the amount of cash dividends that a foreign subsidiary can pay to its parent. The ceiling is typically some percentage of the firm’s net worth and is intended to force the parent to reinvest in the foreign subsidiary. The repatriation of the project cash flows can be a critical issue if there are significant delays in receiving the funds. From the parent firm’s perspective, the relevant cash flow for analysis of foreign capital investment opportunities is the cash flow that the parent company, and its investors, expect to actually receive from a foreign subsidiary.

Exchange Rate Risk
The next issue that financial managers must address when evaluating international capital investments is foreign exchange rate risk. The cash flows from an overseas capital project will most likely be in a foreign currency that must eventually be converted to the parent company’s home currency—the U.S. dollar in the case of an American firm. This is not a simple task because most of the cash flows from capital project are future cash flows. Thus, analysts cannot use the current spot rate to convert one currency to another. To convert the project’s future cash flows into another currency, they must forecast exchange rates.

Where can firms secure forecasts for exchange rates? Forecasts for three or four years into the future can be obtained from most money center banks or from currency specialists in financial markets. However, one of the problems with obtaining currency rate forecasts for use in analysis of capital projects is that many projects have lives of 20 years or more. Needless to say, it is difficult to forecast exchange rates far into the future.

Country Risk
Financial managers must also account for country risk when evaluating foreign business activities. If a firm is located in a country with a relatively unstable political environment, management will require a higher rate of return on capital projects as compensation for the additional risk. At the extreme, a local government could expropriate, or take over, the plant and equipment of an overseas operation. This expropriation of assets is called nationalization. Sometimes, nations will expropriate the assets and offer some form of compensation. In other cases, they will offer no compensation. Other ways that a foreign government can affect the risk of a foreign project include:

Change tax laws in a way that adversely impacts the firm.
Impose laws related to labor, wages, and prices that are more restrictive than those applicable to domestic firms.
Disallow any remittance of funds from the subsidiary to the parent firm for either a limited time or the duration of the project.
Require that the subsidiary be headed by a local citizen or have a local firm as a major equity partner.
Impose tariffs and quotas on any imports.
To help firms assess country risk, some private firms and government agencies rate nations for their relative level of country risk. Exhibit 21.6 shows one such ranking for country risk by a private firm for 2019. In addition, U.S. governmental agencies such as the Department of Commerce and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) gather information on countries continuously, and are able to provide information on country risk to businesses to help them make decisions regarding investing in, exporting to, or importing from a particular country.

Once management has gauged a capital project’s country risk, that risk must be incorporated into the capital budgeting analysis. One way to do this is to adjust the firm’s discount rate for the additional risk. For example, if the firm’s cost of capital is 8 percent and the financial manager’s staff estimates that investment in a particular country requires a 3 percent expected return to compensate for the additional risk, the appropriate discount rate is 11 percent. Of course, from Chapters 7 and 13, we know that adjustments like this should only be made to the discount rate to reflect country risk that is systematic. Unsystematic risk should be reflected in the expected cash flows.

The Barcelona Example
Suppose a U.S.-based manufacturing company is considering the possibility of establishing a manufacturing operation overseas in Barcelona, Spain. The U.S. firm wants overseas capital investment decisions to be based on the same criteria as domestic investment decisions. The firm’s overseas financial staff forecasts the expected incremental after-tax free cash flows for the Barcelona project in millions of euros, as shown in the following time line:


Assume that the current spot rate between the euro (€) and the U.S. dollar ($) is $1.20/€. The parent company’s finance staff acquires forecasts from an analyst for the expected foreign exchange (EFX) rates between the euro and the dollar. These forecasts and calculations for the analysis of the project are shown in the following table:

Year	Cash Flow (€ millions)	EFX Rate	Calculation	Cash Flow ($ millions)
(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)	(5)
0	−€10.00	$1.20/€	−€10.00 × $1.20/€	−$12.00
1	3.00	1.25	3.00 × 1.25	3.75
2	3.00	1.30	3.00 × 1.30	3.90
3	3.00	1.32	3.00 × 1.32	3.96
4	3.00	1.35	3.00 × 1.35	4.05
Column (2) shows the project’s cash flows in euros. Column (3) shows the current spot rate (Year 0) and the forecast foreign exchange rates (Years 1 to 4). In Column (4), the euro cash flows are multiplied by the appropriate exchange rate (spot or forecast) to convert to dollar cash flows, and the results are shown in Column (5).

The firm’s cost of capital is 8 percent, and the financial manager estimates that the project in Barcelona carries a 2 percent country risk premium. Thus, the appropriate discount rate for the project is 10 percent.

With this information, the NPV for the project is computed by discounting the cash flows by the country-risk-adjusted discount rate of 10 percent, as follows:

The project should be accepted because its NPV is positive.

21.4 Global Money and Capital Markets
Learning Objective

Discuss the importance of the Euromarkets to large U.S. multinational firms, and calculate the cost of borrowing in the Eurobond market.
Next, we focus on how multinational business firms use global money and capital markets to adjust their liquidity, to finance their domestic and international operations, and to raise equity capital. The global financial markets operate and transact in securities denominated in all of the world’s major currencies. However, the dollar portion of these global markets is the largest. This is because international business contracts all over the world commonly require payment in U.S. dollars.

The dollar has been a preferred medium of exchange because of the strength and size of the U.S. economy and the government’s long history of political stability. As a result of these factors, businesses, governments, and individuals throughout the world often choose to hold and transact in dollars rather than their home currency.

The euro is now the main currency used in the 19 countries that are part of the Eurozone. (The Eurozone consists of 19 of the 27 member states of the European Union.) The euro is second only to the dollar in its popularity as a reserve currency and in its volume as a traded currency. The renminbi is the currency issued by the People’s Republic of China and is denominated in yuan. The yuan is also an increasingly popular currency for worldwide exchange.

The Emergence of the Euromarkets
Before World War II, dollar-denominated deposits of multinational corporations and governments were held in U.S. money center banks. When the cold war started in the 1950s, the Soviet Union feared that for political reasons the U.S. government might temporarily freeze or expropriate its deposits in the United States. Motivated by profits, a number of London-based banks responded to the Soviets’ concern by offering to hold their dollar-denominated deposits in British banks. The new accounts became quite popular and were soon dubbed Eurodollars. A Eurodollar is defined as a U.S. dollar deposited in a bank outside the United States. The banks accepting these deposits are called Eurobanks.

Eurodollar a U.S. dollar deposited in a bank outside the United State

Over time, other major currencies, such as the Japanese yen and British pound, were deposited offshore, and the Euromarkets emerged. Today, the Euromarkets are vast, largely unregulated money and capital markets. London and New York City are the two most important markets, but Euromarkets also exist in places like Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Though many of the market centers are not in Europe, the term Euromarket has become a generic term.

The Eurocurrency Market
The core of international financial markets is the Eurocurrency market, which is the short-term portion of the Euromarket. A Eurocurrency is a time deposit that is in a bank located in a country different from the country that issued the currency. For example, a Japanese yen or an American dollar account in a British bank is a Eurocurrency account.3

Eurocurrency a time deposit that is in a bank located in a country different from the country that issued the currency

The largest segment of the Eurocurrency market is interbank transactions, in which banks borrow from and lend to one another overnight. Although short-term transactions dominate the market, there is an active market for loans with maturities of up to six months. The importance of the Eurocurrency market lies in its role in allocating funds on a global basis. This means that banks with strong loan demand can borrow Eurocurrencies, such as Eurodollars, and make loans to multinational corporations, sovereign governments, or other large international entities.

The most widely quoted Eurocurrency interest rate is the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, which is the short-term interest rate that major banks in London charge one another. This rate is also commonly used as the base rate for Eurodollar loans other than those between two banks. If the lending bank is located in another Euromarket financial center, such as Singapore, the offer rate quoted is SIBOR, which is the Singapore Interbank Offer Rate; if the bank is based in Hong Kong, the offer rate is HKIBOR; and so on. Because the various Euromarkets are closely linked, the interbank rates for a particular Eurocurrency tend to be similar. The LIBOR is also similar to the Fed funds rate, which is the rate that large U.S. banks charge one another.

London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) the interest rate British-based banks charge each other for short-term loans; commonly used as the base rate for Eurodollar loans that are not between two banks

Problems with LIBOR, including the discovery that several major financial institutions manipulated the rate for many years, have led many regulators around the world to develop alternatives. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is recommending that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) be used as a replacement for the U.S. dollar LIBOR by the end of 2023. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight using U.S. Treasury securities as collateral. Many firms have already adopted SOFR as a lending rate. Whether you are using LIBOR or another rate, the approach to calculations that we have outlined here is the same.

The Eurocredit Market
The international banking system gathers funds from businesses and governments in the Eurocurrency market and then allocates funds to banks that have the most profitable lending opportunities. These loans are called Eurocredits—short- to medium-term loans of a Eurocurrency to multinational corporations and governments of medium to high credit quality. Eurocredits are denominated in all major Eurocurrencies, although the dollar is the overwhelming favorite. An example of a Eurocredit transaction is an American firm borrowing Eurodollars from a bank in Hong Kong.

Eurocredits short- to medium-term loans of a Eurocurrency to multinational corporations and governments of medium to high credit quality

International Bond Markets
International bonds fall into two generic categories: foreign bonds and Eurobonds.

Foreign Bonds

Foreign bonds are long-term debt sold by a foreign firm to investors in another country and denominated in that country’s currency. They are called foreign bonds because the issuer is a foreigner in the country where the bonds are sold. Foreign bonds may have colorful nicknames: foreign bonds sold in the United States are called Yankee bonds, and yen-denominated bonds sold in Japanese financial markets by non-Japanese firms are called Samurai bonds.

Firms sell foreign bonds when they need to finance projects in a particular foreign country. For example, the German car manufacturer BMW might decide to sell dollar-denominated bonds in the United States to build an assembly plant in South Carolina. Similarly, Amazon.com might need euros to build a new shipping hub in Germany. To raise the euros, Amazon.com could sell euro-denominated bonds in Germany to German and other European investors.

Eurobonds

Eurobonds are long-term debt instruments sold by firms to investors in countries other than the country in whose currency the bonds are denominated. Multinational firms can use Eurobonds to finance international or domestic projects. For example, suppose Ford Motor Company decides to sell U.S.-dollar denominated bonds in Europe. Investors would call the bonds Eurodollar bonds. What can Ford do with the dollars from the bond sales? It can spend them overseas to finance a project, or it can spend them in the United States—after all, a dollar is a dollar.

The fact that the proceeds from a Eurodollar bond issue can be spent in the United States raises an important point. During the 1980s, multinational firms discovered that they could sell Eurodollar bond issues at interest cost savings as large as 50 to 150 basis points (0.5 to 1.5 percent) annually compared with similar bond issues sold domestically. Needless to say, multinationals that needed to borrow dollars long term flocked to the Eurodollar bond market. Although the large interest cost spreads we have mentioned no longer exist, today any multinational firm that needs to borrow dollars long term routinely evaluates whether it makes more sense to sell the bond issue domestically or in the Eurodollar bond market.

Eurodollar and other Eurocurrency bonds have a number of characteristics that differ from similar U.S corporate bonds. Eurobonds are bearer bonds and do not have to be registered. Because the bonds are not registered, there is no record of who owns them. As a result, some Eurobond investors conveniently “forget” to pay taxes on the coupon income earned. This is no secret, of course, and there is growing pressure to eliminate bearer bonds.

Eurobonds also differ from domestic bonds in that they pay interest, in the form of coupon payments, annually, whereas U.S. corporate bonds make coupon payments twice a year. Thus, the interest rate on Eurodollar bonds is not directly comparable to similar domestic bonds because of the difference in compounding periods.

Finally, historically almost all Eurocurrency bonds were sold without credit ratings. The reason for this practice was that almost all bond issues sold in Europe were purchased by institutional investors who relied on their own credit analyses, so there was no reason for the issuer to purchase a credit rating for the bond issue. However, since the mid-1980s, the retail segment of the equity and bond markets in Western Europe has grown significantly. Individual investors typically prefer to purchase bonds that have credit ratings. Today, more than half of the Eurodollar bonds sold in Europe have credit ratings.

Learning by Doing Application 21.5 illustrates the comparison of returns on Eurodollar versus domestic bonds.

Problem

Suppose Hewlett-Packard (HP) needs $350 million to build a new facility. The firm plans to finance the facility by selling bonds domestically or in the Eurodollar bond market. In either case, the bond issue will have a maturity of three years, a par value of $1,000, and coupon interest payments totaling $50 a year. After transaction costs and underwriters’ fees, the domestic bond issue will net $951.90 per bond, and the Eurodollar bonds will net $948.00 per bond. Which bonds—domestic or Eurodollar—should HP issue?

21.5 International Banking
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain how large U.S. money center banks make and price Eurocredit loans to their customers, and compute the cost of a Eurocredit bank loan.
During the period when the major European countries were establishing their colonial empires, British, Dutch, and Belgian banks developed a worldwide presence, and London emerged as the center of international banking and finance. European governments fostered the growth of large international banks in their countries and viewed them as engines of territorial and economic expansion.

In the United States, it was quite a different story. National banks, which are chartered by the federal government, were not permitted to establish branches or accept bills of exchange outside the United States until passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. However, even after the act was passed, American banks did not rush to do business overseas. Not until after World War II did American banks begin to establish any significant foreign presence. The catalyst for growth was the expansion of American corporations as they established sales offices overseas, imported foreign goods, and acquired foreign manufacturing facilities. To accommodate their customers’ needs, large U.S. banks established networks of foreign branches and affiliates. Today, Chinese financial institutions are expanding rapidly into the world market.

Exhibit 21.7 shows the 15 largest banks in the world in 2020. These banks offer a full range of international and domestic banking services to businesses in their home countries and to multinational firms overseas. The services include providing transaction accounts, commercial loans, foreign exchange, underwriting of debt and equity issues, and letters of credit.

Risks Involved in International Bank Lending
The principles of loan administration and credit analysis are similar for domestic and overseas loans. There are differences, however, including some additional risk exposures for overseas lending.

Credit Risk

Credit risk involves assessing the probability that some part of the interest or principal due to a lender will not be paid, a condition commonly referred to as credit default. The greater the probability of default, the higher the loan rate that the bank must charge the borrower. Credit risk is the same whether a loan is domestic or international. However, it may be more difficult to obtain or evaluate credit information about borrowers abroad. U.S. banks operating abroad are less familiar with local economic conditions and business practices than are domestic banks. It takes time and practice to develop appropriate sources of information and to understand how to evaluate such information. As a result, many U.S. banks tend to restrict their foreign lending to large, well-known companies or financial institutions.

Currency Risk

We have already discussed foreign exchange rate risk. Fluctuations in exchange rates can affect the cash flows associated with a loan or investment, and, hence, can affect their value. Some loans made by U.S. banks are denominated in foreign currency rather than dollars, and if the foreign currency is expected to lose value against the dollar during the course of the loan, the repayment will be worth fewer dollars. Thus, bank loans that have foreign exchange rate risk will carry an additional risk premium; the greater the foreign exchange rate risk, the higher the loan rate the bank must charge the borrower.

Of course, if the foreign currency has a well-developed market and the maturity of the loan is relatively short, the loan may be hedged. However, many world currencies, particularly those in developing nations, do not have well-established foreign currency markets. Consequently, these international loans cannot always be hedged at a reasonable price.

Country Risk

We have also discussed country risk, which is tied to political developments in a country that could affect the cash flows associated with a loan or investment in that country. If an international loan might suffer some loss in value due to political developments, the loan will carry an additional risk premium; the greater the country risk of a loan, the higher the rate the bank must charge the borrower.

Eurocredit Bank Loans
As noted earlier, Eurocredits are short- to medium-term loans to multinational corporations or governments. The loans are denominated in a currency that is different from the bank’s home currency. Eurocredits can have a high degree of credit risk and may be too large for a single bank to handle. As a result, the lending banks often form a syndicate to spread the risk. Each bank in the lending syndicate participates by taking a portion of the loan. One bank acts as the lead bank and is responsible for negotiating the price of the loan and its terms with the borrower.

The loan pricing for Eurocredits is similar to the loan pricing that U.S. money center banks use for their largest domestic customers. The loan rate (k) is equal to a base rate, such as LIBOR, which represents the bank’s cost of funds, plus a markup, which is the bank’s lending margin:

where X is the lending margin. The lending margin depends on the borrower’s credit risk; international risk factors, such as foreign exchange rate (currency) risk and country risk; and the bank’s gross profit margin. From the gross profit margin, the bank must cover all its expenses in making the loan and earn a profit. The general equation for Eurocredit pricing can thus be expressed as follows:

(21.3)
where:

k	=	individual firm’s loan rate
BR	=	Eurocurrency base rate, such as LIBOR
DRP	=	default risk premium
FXR	=	foreign exchange rate or currency risk premium
CR	=	country risk premium
GPMAR	=	bank’s gross profit margin
Eurocredits typically are floating-rate loans structured as “rollovers.” Rollover pricing was developed to protect banks against adverse interest rate movements so that lenders do not end up paying more on the Eurocurrency time deposit than they earn from the loan. Banks are vulnerable to taking such losses because the money to fund Eurocredits comes from short-term deposits. As a result, a Eurocredit can be viewed as a series of short-term loans, where at the end of each time period (three or six months), the loan is “rolled over” and repriced at the current market interest rate.

Suppose, for example, that Citibank is considering making a Eurocredit loan to a Mexican manufacturer that needs to borrow $1.5 million for three years. The bank lending officer wants the loan to be structured as a six-month, floating-rate loan. That means the loan is a three-year loan priced as six successive six-month loans. The bank’s credit department believes the credit risk premium is 3 percent, the country risk for Mexico is an additional 1 percent, and the bank’s gross profit margin is 0.125 percent. The bank can buy the funds in the Euromarket: the six-month LIBOR rate is 0.24 percent. Applying the loan pricing model (Equation 21.3), we find that the Eurocredit pricing for this loan is:

Note that the loan involves no foreign exchange rate risk (FXR) for the bank, because the loan is in dollars.

We can also describe the loan rate in terms of the lending margin (X), which is the markup used to reprice the loan when it rolls over. For the Mexican loan, the lending margin is as follows:

When the loan is repriced at the end of six months, if LIBOR at that point is 0.50 percent, the new loan rate will be 4.625 percent (0.50 percent + 4.125 percent = 4.625 percent).

Lending margins are quite small for North American and Western European multinational companies with good credit ratings. The margins are low because the credit risk and country risk for these companies are low.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Discuss how the basic principles of finance apply to international financial transactions.

The basic principles of finance remain the same whether a transaction is domestic or international. For example, the time value of money calculations remain the same, as do the models used to calculate asset values. What does change, however, are some of the input variables. These variables may be affected by cultural or procedural differences between countries or differences in tax and accounting standards. Exhibit 21.2 lists some of these changes.

2 Differentiate among the spot rate, the forward rate, and the cross rate in the foreign exchange markets, perform foreign exchange and cross rate calculations, and hedge an asset purchase where payment is made in a foreign currency.

The spot rate is the exchange rate at which one currency can be converted to another immediately, whereas the forward rate is a rate agreed on today for an exchange to take place at a specified point in the future. Forward rates are usually different from spot rates and are the market’s best estimate of what a future spot rate will be. The cross rate is simply the exchange rate between two currencies. Learning by Doing Applications 21.1 through 21.3 illustrate foreign exchange rate problems that you should be able to solve.

3 Identify the major factors that distinguish international from domestic capital budgeting, explain how the capital budgeting process can be adjusted to account for these factors, and compute the NPV for a typical international capital project.

One issue that distinguishes international from domestic capital budgeting is the difficulty in estimating the incremental cash flows from an international project. These difficulties can stem from differences in operating, accounting, and legal practices, as well as from the variety of ways in which a multinational firm can transfer profits and funds from the subsidiary to the parent corporation. Furthermore, firms engaged in international capital budgeting face two risks that domestic firms do not have to deal with: foreign exchange rate risk and country risk. The Barcelona example in Section 21.3 and Learning by Doing Application 21.4 illustrate capital budgeting calculations.

4 Discuss the importance of the Euromarkets to large U.S. multinational firms, and calculate the cost of borrowing in the Eurobond market.

The Eurocurrency markets are important to large multinational corporations. These corporations hold Eurocurrency time deposits as investments and finance much of their business activity by borrowing in the Eurocredit market and selling debt in the Eurobond market. The Euromarkets are popular with large multinational firms because they are largely unregulated; thus, they offer more attractive borrowing and lending rates and greater flexibility in conducting transactions. Learning by Doing Application 21.5 illustrates how to calculate the cost of issuing bonds in the domestic and Eurobond markets.

5 Explain how large U.S. money center banks make and price Eurocredit loans to their customers, and compute the cost of a Eurocredit bank loan.

Eurocredit loans are made by large multinational banks. Eurocredits typically have fixed maturities and variable, or floating, rates of interest. The loan rate is tied to a base interest rate (BR), such as LIBOR. The total rate charged on a Eurocredit is BR + X, where X is the lending margin, which consists of risk premiums (credit, country, and currency risks) and the lender’s profit margin. The Citibank example in Section 21.5 and Learning by Doing Application 21.6 illustrate how loan costs are computed.

Notes
1 Sovereign nations are nations that have the right of self-rule, which includes the right to regulate commerce within their borders.
2 You may wonder why there was a currency conversion for the initial cash flow in the Barcelona example and no similar conversion for this problem. The reason is that for the current problem, the initial cash flow of −$10 million is already in U.S. dollars, and thus there is no need for a conversion. The remaining cash flows are in TWD.
3 Note that an American dollar deposited overseas, which is a Eurodollar, is only one of many Eurocurrencies.

Solutions to Odd Problems
Chapter 1
1.1. The two basic sources of funds for all businesses are debt and equity.

1.3. A profitable firm is able to generate enough cash flows from productive assets to cover its operating expenses, taxes, and payments to creditors. Unprofitable firms fail to do this, and therefore, they may be forced to declare bankruptcy or close the business.

1.5. A firm should undertake a capital project only if the value of its future cash flows exceeds the cost of the project. For example, a financial manager would not invest $10,000,000 in a new production line if the net present value of future cash flows from that line are expected to be only $9,000,000. That would be like throwing $1,000,000 away.

1.7. The financial manager must make working capital decisions regarding the level of inventory to hold, the terms of granting credit (accounts receivable), and the firm’s policy on paying accounts payable.

1.9. Advantages: It is the easiest business organization to start and the least regulated; owners keep all the profits and do not have to share the decision-making authority with anyone; all income is taxed as personal income, which is usually in a lower tax bracket than corporate income. Disadvantages: The proprietor has unlimited liability for all business debt and financial obligations of the firm; the amount of capital that can be invested in the firm is limited by the proprietor’s wealth; it is difficult to transfer ownership (requires sale of the business).

1.11. The owners of a corporation are its stockholders or shareholders, and the evidence of their ownership is represented by shares of common stock. Other types of ownership do exist and include preferred stock.

1.13. Double taxation occurs when earnings are taxed twice. The owners of a C-corporation are subject to double taxation—first at the corporate level when the firm’s earnings are taxed and then again at a personal level when they receive dividends.

1.15. The board of directors of a corporation is responsible for serving the interests of stockholders in managing the corporation. It is possible that the interest of managers may deviate from those of the stockholders. The board’s objective is to monitor and correct any management decisions that might not be in the best interest of the stockholders. For example, board duties include hiring and firing the CEO, setting CEO pay, and monitoring the investment decisions of managers.

1.17. Drawbacks include: It is difficult to determine what is meant by “profit”; it does not address the size and timing of cash flows—it does not account for the time value of money; it ignores the uncertainty or risk of cash flows.

1.19. Both internal and external factors affect the stock price. They include the characteristics of the firm, the state of the economy, economic shocks, the business environment, expected cash flows (magnitude, timing, and risk), and current market conditions.

1.21. If the stock price falls below its maximum potential price, it attracts corporate raiders, who look for fundamentally sound but poorly managed companies that they can buy, turn around, and sell for a handsome profit.

1.23. A lack of business ethics can lead to corruption, which, in turn, creates inefficiencies in an economy, inhibits the growth of capital markets, and slows the rate of overall economic growth. For example, the Russian economy has had a relatively difficult time attracting foreign investment since the fall of the Soviet Union due, in part, to weak ethics and corruption in the business community and local and national governments. Lower foreign investment has led to slower overall economic growth than the country might otherwise have enjoyed.

1.25. Information asymmetry exists when one party to a business transaction possesses information that is not available to the other parties in the transaction. If the parties with less information understand their relative disadvantage, they are likely to pay lower prices for the goods and services they purchase or charge higher prices for the goods and services they sell.

Chapter 2
2.1. The role of the financial system is to gather money from households, businesses, and governments with surplus funds and channel these funds to those who need them. The financial system consists of financial markets and financial institutions.

2.3. Saver-lenders are those who have more money than they currently need. The principal saver-lenders in the economy are households. Borrower-spenders are those who need the money saver-lenders are offering. The main borrower-spenders in the economy are businesses, vbbnm, followed by the federal government, although households are important mortgage borrowers.

2.5. As the price of the security is lower than what you paid for it, it has a lower degree of liquidity to you, the owner. That is because the security cannot now be sold without a loss in value to the owner. Marketability refers to the ease with which a security can be sold or converted to cash. The information in the problem mentions that the security could be easily sold in secondary market, which implies it has high degree of marketability to you.

2.7. Trader Inc. is more likely to go public because of its larger size. Since the cost of SEC registration and compliance is very high, larger firms can offset these costs with the lower funding cost in public markets. Smaller companies find the cost prohibitive for the dollar amount of securities they sell.

2.13. Financial intermediaries allow smaller companies to access the financial markets. They do this by converting securities with one set of characteristics into securities with another set of characteristics that meets the needs of smaller companies. By repackaging securities, they are able to meet the needs of different clients.

2.15. Money markets are markets in which short-term debt instruments with maturities of less than one year are bought and sold. Capital markets are markets in which equity securities and debt instruments with maturities of more than one year are bought and sold.

2.17. Treasury bills and commercial paper.

2.19. The strong form of market efficiency states that all information is reflected in the security prices. In other words, there is no private or inside information that, if released, would potentially change the price. The semistrong form holds that all public information available to investors is reflected in the security’s price. Therefore, insiders with access to private information could potentially profit from trading on this knowledge before it becomes public. Finally, the weak form of market efficiency holds that there is both public and private information that is not reflected in the security’s price and having access to it can lead to abnormal profits.

2.21. Yes. The last sentence in the statement of Problem 2.20 suggests why this might happen. If, on the day of the announcement, some very bad news about the future prospects for Zippy became public, or if the market went down substantially, Zippy’s stock price might also have gone down despite the positive sales and earnings announcement. Zippy’s stock price may also go down if strong results were anticipated and this information was already reflected in the stock price, but the actual results were not as strong as anticipated. This is an example of the strong form of market efficiency.

2.23. Public markets are organized financial markets (also referred to as exchanges) where the public buys and sells securities through their stockbrokers. The SEC regulates public securities markets in the United States. In contrast, private markets involve direct transactions between two parties. These transactions lack SEC regulation.

2.25. The real rate of interest measures the return earned on savings, and it represents the cost of borrowing to finance capital goods. It is the interest rate in the absence of inflation. The real rate of interest is determined by the interaction between (1) firms that invest in capital projects and the rate of return they can expect to earn on investments in capital goods and (2) individuals’ time preference for consumption. Graphically, it is that point where the desired saving level equals the desired level of investment in the economy.

2.27. The Fisher equation reflects the expected, not the reported or actual, annualized change in commodity prices (∆Pe). It is used to protect buying power from changes in inflation, and it is incorporated into a loan contract by including the real interest rate that would exist in the absence of inflation.

2.29. Yes. The CD will be worth $1,067.50 at the end of the year and the price of the trip will be $1,066.

3.3. FIFO makes sense during times of rising prices because it allows the firm to eliminate the lower-priced inventory first, resulting in a higher profit margin. This allows the firm to leave higher-valued inventory on the balance sheet. During inflationary times, a firm using LIFO would see a lower profit margin and lower values of inventory on the balance sheet. It is important that anyone who is analyzing firms using different accounting methods on inventory recognizes the impact on the bottom line (profit margin and net income per the income statement) and on current assets reported on the balance sheet.

3.11. A firm may have several items on its income statement that did not result in any cash outflow to the firm. The two largest are depreciation expenses and amortization expenses. Other noncash expenses include deferred taxes and depletion charges, which are similar to depreciation and are used for natural resource assets. Gains and losses on disposals of assets also fit into this category, as they are reported on the income statement but do not involve cash inflows or outflows.

4.1. The quick ratio is a better or more conservative measure of liquidity than the current ratio. The difference in the measurement of the two is that for the quick ratio we exclude the inventory from short-term assets. Thus, the quick ratio is measured as:

This measure includes only the most liquid of the current assets and hence gives a better measure of liquidity.

We can see that Trademark is not doing as well as its competitors. The asset turnover ratio indicates that the firm needs to either increase its sales relative to its level of assets or reduce its assets relative to its level of sales. In addition, the lower quick ratio indicates a lower level of liquidity, perhaps because of too much inventory. A reduction in the inventory would help Trademark improve its performance to a level that is comparable to its peer group. In addition, collection of receivables is longer, which could result in cash flow problems and nonpayments.
Average industry ratios serve as benchmarks for the firm’s management to measure its own performance. While no two firms in any industry are identical, the average ratios across the industry are good target ratios for a firm.

7.1. A holding period return is the total return over some investment period, or “holding” period. It consists of a capital appreciation component and an income component. A holding period return reflects past performance. The expected return is a weighted average of the possible returns from an investment, where each of these returns is weighted by the probability that it will occur. It describes a possible return (or even a return that may not be possible) for a yet-to-occur investment period.

7.9. Risk that cannot be diversified away is systematic risk. It is the only type of risk that exists in a diversified portfolio, and it is the only type of risk that is rewarded in asset markets.

7.11. Since the beta of any asset is the slope of the line of best fit for the plot of the asset against that of the market return, then we can use that logic to help us understand the beta of a T-bill. If we purchased a T-bill five years ago and held the same T-bill through each of the last 60 months, then the return for each of those 60 months would be exactly the same. Therefore, the vertical axis coordinates of each of the monthly returns would have the same value, and the slope (beta) of the line of best fit would be zero. A beta of zero means that our T-bill has no systematic risk. That is logical given that we know a T-bill has no risk at all, since it is a riskless asset.

7.13. The CAPM describes the relation between systematic risk and the expected return. The model tells us that the expected return on an asset with no systematic risk equals the risk-free rate. As systematic risk increases, the expected return increases linearly with beta. The CAPM is written as E(Ri) = Rrf + β i[E(Rm) – Rrf].

7.23. Your portfolio contains no unsystematic risk, but it does contain systematic risk. Therefore, the market should compensate you for the systematic risk that you bear. A risk-free security has no risk and therefore requires no compensation for risk bearing. The expected return of your portfolio should therefore be greater than the return of the risk-free security.

7.25. The statement is false. A portfolio of all assets would only eliminate unsystematic risk. The systematic risk would remain. If you could eliminate both systematic and unsystematic risk, the expected rate of return on the market portfolio would be equal to the risk-free rate of return, and we know that this is not true.

7.33. If all investors require returns that compensate them for the level of risk that they bear, then undiversified investors will require a greater return for a given investment than diversified investors will. In other words, diversified investors will be willing to pay a higher price for an asset than will undiversified investors. Therefore, a diversified investor is the marginal investor whose purchase will determine the price and, therefore, the expected return for an asset.

7.35. The Security Market Line (SML) shows the relationship between an asset’s expected return and its beta. We know the market has a beta of one, and we know the risk-free rate has a beta of zero. The risk-free rate of return is 7%, and the market is expected to return 5% more than this. Therefore, the expected rate of return for the market (a beta one asset) is 12%. To draw this SML, we need only connect the dots:


We can see from the following diagram that an asset with an expected return of 4% and a beta of –1.0 is underpriced (its expected return is too high). As the market becomes aware of this underpricing, investors will purchase the asset, bidding up its price until its expected return falls on the SML. (Recall that as the initial purchase price of an asset increases, the expected return from purchasing the asset will decrease because you are paying a higher initial cost for the asset.)


As we can see from the following diagram, an asset with a beta of 3.0 should have an expected return of 7% + (3)(5%) = 22%. The asset only has an expected return of 20%. Therefore, this asset is overpriced. Demand for this asset will be low, driving down its market price, until the asset’s expected return falls on the SML.

The stock price would have to increase by approximately two standard deviations (2 × $5 = $10) for the price to increase to $25 and for conversion to become attractive to investors. From Chapter 7, we know that 95% of possible outcomes fall within two standard deviations of the mean (average) value in a normal distribution. This means that there is a 5% chance that the stock price will move up or down by $10 or more. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, this means that there is only a 2.5% chance that Zippy’s stock price will increase enough for it to become attractive for investors to exercise the conversion option in the next year.

9.1. A stock market index is used to measure the performance of the stock market. These indexes reflect the value of the stocks in a particular market, such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ, or across markets, and they increase and decrease as the values of the stocks go up and down. Examples of stock market indexes include the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the New York Stock Exchange Index, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and the NASDAQ Composite Index.

9.3. NASDAQ stands for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system. NASDAQ is one of the largest electronic stock markets in the world, listing over three thousand companies. It is an OTC market with no physical location.

10.13. The profitability index is a measure of the value a project generates for each dollar invested in that project. It is computed as the ratio of NPV plus initial investment divided by initial investment. In the capital rationing process, we can calculate the profitability index for each potential investment and choose the projects with the largest indexes until we run out of capital. This follows the basic principle that we need to choose the set of projects that creates the greatest value given the limited capital available.

10.19. The discounted payback periods for the projects are: Project A = 4+ years; Project B = 3+ years. Since the firm’s acceptance criterion is a payback of three years, neither project will be accepted.

System 1 delivers a higher IRR because it requires a lower initial investment and the cost is recovered the first year. Thus, even with lower cash inflows in the years after startup, System 1 is able to deliver a higher return on the initial investment. System 2 has a higher initial investment but delivers a higher net cash flow for the firm.

10.35. Project 1 = 20.1%; Project 2 = 12.4%. Given a required rate of return of 15%, Project 1 will be accepted, as the IRR of 20.1% exceeds the required rate of return. Project 2 will be rejected.

Project A = 27.2%; Project B = 26.1%
Since both projects have positive NPVs and they are independent projects, both should be accepted under the NPV decision criteria. Under the IRR decision criteria, since both projects have IRRs greater than the cost of capital, both will be accepted. Thus, there is no conflict between the NPV and IRR decisions.
Based on NPV, both projects will be accepted.
10.43. NPVX = $2,650.78; NPVY = $2,189.06; PIX = 1.1325; PIY = 1.1095. Both methods rank Project X over Project Y. Both should be accepted if they are independent and sufficient resources are available. If the projects are mutually exclusive, we should choose the project with the higher PI at r = 10%, which is Project X.

10.45.

IRR for Super Cutter = 17.97%; IRR for Duper Cutter = 14.76%. Since the cutters are mutually exclusive and the question advises us to use the IRR, we should choose the Super Cutter, since it has the higher rate of return (17.97%) as measured by IRR.
PISuperCutter = 1.244; PIDuperCutter = 1.143. The cutters are mutually exclusive, and the question advises us to use the PI, so we should choose the Super Cutter, since it has a higher profitability index (1.244 versus 1.143).
In this case, the profitability index method and the IRR do not give conflicting recommendations, so using both methods, the company would choose the Super Cutter. However, by computing the NPV, we see that the Duper Cutter will add $6,328.90 more value to the company than the Super Cutter. This happens because the scale of the Duper Cutter is much larger and as a result the value added as measured by NPV is higher. If resources were limited, we would choose by investing in the cutter that creates more value per dollar of investment, which is achieved by choosing the cutter with the higher profitability index, the Super Cutter. However, according to the question, there are no resource constraints, so I would advise the CFO not to use either IRR or PI for making his or her decision but instead choose to the Duper Cutter. Based on the NPV analysis, it would add more value to the company.
10.47. The correct answer is c; the discount payback period is 1.01 years longer than the payback period.

10.49. The correct answer is d; IRR = 28.79%.

Chapter 11
11.1. Accounting earnings can differ from cash flows for a number of reasons, making accounting earnings an unreliable measure of the costs and benefits of a project. For example, ease of manipulating earnings components such as accounts receivable and depreciation may result in distorted estimation of capital budgeting; using forecasted cash flows eliminates such possibilities. In addition, because of the time value of money, cash flows better reflect the actual available funds to be distributed to shareholders at any point in time.

11.3. There are two ways to adjust for depreciation: (1) subtract depreciation from EBITDA, multiply it by (1 – tax rate), and then add depreciation back; (2) add the tax shield from depreciation (depreciation multiplied by tax rate) to revenue. These two methods yield the same results. The assumption is that although depreciation itself is not a cash inflow or outflow, an increase in depreciation will result in a decrease in taxable income. This saving on tax is treated as a cash inflow in calculating incremental after-tax free cash flows.

11.5. The average tax rate is the total amount of tax divided by the total amount of money earned, while the marginal tax rate is the rate paid on the last dollar earned. In a progressive tax system, the marginal tax rate differs from the average tax rate. Since a firm already pays taxes, the appropriate tax rate used for the firm’s new project is the tax rate that the firm will pay on any additional profits that are earned because the project is adopted. Therefore, we use the marginal tax rate in calculating incremental after-tax cash flows.

11.7. Variable costs vary directly with unit sales, while fixed costs do not. Variable costs are those associated with purchasing the components for the product, the labor required, and sales and marketing. These costs vary according to the number of units produced. Fixed costs are those associated with assembly space and administrative expenses.

11.9. $9,436.80

11.11. $1,370

11.13. The equivalent annual cost (EAC) is the annualized cost of an investment stated in nominal dollars. In other words, it is the annual payment from an annuity with a life equal to that of a project that has the same NPV as the project. Since it is a measure of the annual cost or cash inflow from a project, the EAC for one project can be compared directly with the EAC from another project, regardless of the lives of those two projects.

11.15. You can effectively make the lives of the projects the same by assuming repeated investments over some identical period and compare the NPVs.

11.17. You should invest in bond A because it pays a higher nominal interest rate.

11.19. The relevant cash flow related to working capital at the beginning of the project is:

$10,000 + $30,000 + $25,000 – $5,000 = $60,000
The present value of relevant cash flow related to working capital at the end of the project is:

$60,000/(1 + 0.12)10 = $19,318.39
11.21. NPV = $795,165.59. Since NPV > 0, project should be accepted.

Chapter 12
12.1. Fixed costs are costs that in the short term cannot be changed regardless of how much output the project produces. One example is the in-home technical computer support business (discussed in Learning by Doing Application 12.1). Regardless of the number of house calls the technical support firm makes, it will incur the full cost of advertising. Variable costs are costs that depend on the number of units of output produced by the project. An example is the gas that the technical support firm uses to make house calls. The cost to keep the vehicles gassed up is directly related to the number of service calls the firm makes.

12.3. Yes. EBIT is $375,000 with the new technology and $250,000 with the old. Since the EBIT after the technology change is $125,000 higher, the firm should adopt the new production technology.

12.5. 1.392

12.7. The degree of accounting operating leverage gives us the ratio with which the firm can convert revenues into EBIT. That is, if the firm’s operating leverage is 3, then a 15% increase will convert to a 45% (15% × 3) increase in EBIT for the firm.

12.9. Per-unit contribution is critical to break-even analysis to enable a firm to determine how many units must be sold to cover the firm’s fixed costs.

12.11. The accounting operating break-even point tells us the number of units that must be sold each year during the life of a project in order for the project to break even with regard to its opportunity cost of capital. Because the accounting operating break-even point calculation accounts for all cash flows over the life of a project, it enables us to compute the annual level of unit sales that will result in an NPV of $0. This is, by definition, the break-even point with regard to a project’s opportunity cost of capital.

12.13. Since depreciation and amortization are noncash items, the manufacturing firm would have the greatest discrepancy between FCF and EBIT.

12.15. Specialty should produce and sell the bulbs because EBIT for the additional bulbs is positive (EBIT = $1,000).

12.17. 15.9%

12.19. 340,000 candles

12.21. While the business may show an accounting loss, our focus should be on the cash flow gain or loss. A project can produce an accounting loss but cash flow income because the depreciation and amortization charges do not apply to the cash flow calculations, as they are noncash expenses that help to reduce the tax liability. Therefore, the project is viable if it does not show a cash flow loss.

12.23. $3,672

12.25. Sensitivity analysis captures the effect of a change in a single item, such as unit selling price, or a change in the number of units sold on a specific item, such as EBIT. However, it is unlikely that a change in the selling price of an item will not affect the demand, and consequently the number of units sold, for the product in question. Scenario analysis analyzes multiple effects on an item such as EBIT by changing several interrelated variables at the same time to measure the effect of an entire scenario change. Therefore, scenario analysis is a much more practical tool for stress-testing a project.

12.27. By increasing the price of a bottle by 10%, the FCF increases by $8,400 from $38,000 to $46,400.

12.31. A 10% increase in revenue will drive a 20% increase in EBITDA.

12.33. The firm with the higher fixed cost should have a lower variable cost per unit, assuming that there is a trade-off. A lower variable cost per unit would then increase the contribution margin for that firm.

12.35. Based on the expected values, the NPV of the project is −$52,649, so it should be accepted.

12.37. 3,992 cars

12.39. The correct answer is c. If the Fulcrum Company increases production and sales by 5%, its operating earnings are expected to increase by 20%.

13.3. When we calculate the cost of debt for a U.S. firm, we must take into account the tax subsidy given in the United States for interest payments on debt. For every dollar the firm pays in interest, the firm’s tax bill will decline by ($1 × t), where t is the firm’s marginal tax rate. We adjust for this tax benefit by multiplying the pretax cost of debt by (1 − t). This calculation gives us the after-tax cost of debt. We use the after-tax cost of debt for cost of capital calculations such as calculating the WACC.

The cash flow claim on the assets is prioritized by the financing of the assets. Therefore, the financing claims on the assets of the firm fully account for the entire value of the assets, and the value of the financing claims must equal the value of the assets that are carved up by those claims.

It is easy to see that in order to solve for a cost of capital, kcs, you must have a good idea of what g1 and g2 are. If those growth rates are poor estimates, then the calculation for kcs will also be a poor estimate.

13.23. Markets adjust the cost of capital according to the level of systematic risk in a project. Therefore, the project with the greatest level of systematic risk will have the greatest positive impact on the cost of capital for the firm, even if it has the lowest level of unsystematic risk.

13.25. Since Imaginary will be financing the project with the same mix of capital that it is currently utilizing for its projects, we will have met the first restriction concerning financing mix. In addition, the new project will have the same degree of systematic risk (in addition to involving the same general line of business). Therefore, Imaginary can use the 9.26% cost of capital to evaluate its project.

13.27. While the growth in dividends has been extremely constant for Macroswift over the last 15 years, it is appropriate to assume a constant-growth rate only if that same rate will continue in the future. Two factors will act to alter that growth in the future. MacroSwift will have competition for its current product list in the near future, and that could alter the firm’s growth rate. In addition, the firm is expanding its product line into an area that will probably not yield the same level of growth. It is therefore unlikely that MacroSwift’s dividend growth rate will continue at a 3% annual rate. This suggests that we should consider something other than constant growth in our modeling.

13.33. Market returns play a role in market prices. If those prices are ignored, then the benefits from the efficiency of the market’s information process are essentially thrown away. Since the market adjusts securities prices according to the expected return for investing in a security, then ignoring that information is the same as ignoring what the market deems to be an appropriate cost of capital for the firm. The theory underlying the discounting process requires that the cost of the different types of financing be weighted by their relative market values.

13.35. Since, collectively, the debt and equity holders are entitled to receive all of the cash flows that the assets of the firm are expected to produce, the systematic risk of the cash flows that they are entitled to receive must be the same as the systematic risk of the cash flows the assets are expected to produce.

14.7. The risk of a restrictive current asset management strategy comes from exposure to shortage costs, which can be either financial or operating costs. Financial costs are associated with a sudden and unforeseen loss of liquidity that makes it difficult for a firm to repay its current liabilities. In this condition, firms may be forced to rely on costly external emergency borrowing. If such funds can’t be secured, firms may have to default on their loan obligations. Operating shortage costs result from lost production or sales that occur if a firm does not have sufficient raw materials or finished goods. Operating shortage costs may also occur if a firm’s credit policies are too restrictive and deter a significant number of sales to potential customers.

Every business plan should contain the following information: (1) a description of the business and industry trends, (2) vision and key strategies for the business, (3) principal products or services and any innovative features or patents, (4) the management team and their experience, (5) market analysis and sales forecast, (6) how the products will be marketed and sold, (7) production costs such as materials and labor, (8) facilities needed and estimated costs, (9) capital required and the use of the proceeds, and (10) detailed budget with six years of projected financial statements.

15.3. A firm can choose to either sell the business at some period, take it public, or in some instances remain a private company with few shareholders.

15.5. In order to determine the price of a new security, the investment banker can look at comparable companies and see what they are trading for. Another approach is performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which is just like determining the price of a stock. You forecast future cash flows of the company, usually for a time horizon of 5 to 10 years, and discount them back to the present in order to get the firm value. The discount rate will be a factor in both the cost of debt and the cost of equity (WACC).

15.7. Debt issues that are complex in nature and/or issued at times of uncertainty tend to be brought to the market by negotiated sales. This approach allows the underwriter to better control the uncertain situation and better explains the firm to potential investors, thereby leading to lower issue costs.

15.9. $24,308,528

15.11. The steps in a general cash offering are (1) type of security and amount to be raised, (2) approvals, (3) registration statement, (4) offer price, and (5) closing.

15.13. The economies of scale in issuing securities means that as the size of the issue increases, the total issue cost, as a percentage of the amount raised, declines. High fixed costs are spread out over a larger sum.

15.15. A public offering allows for higher security, since SEC is involved; it offers more liquidity, which might be important for a large issue; and it usually leads to a higher yield. Private placement, on the other hand, offers faster speed to market, lower issuance cost, and ease of restructuring. Given the size of the Nalco Holdings, the company would be better off choosing to raise debt in the public market.

15.17. The borrowing cost will increase to 9.43%.

15.19. You can fund the project in stages. This will allow you to review the project’s profitability before you commit to further financing. You can also require the entrepreneurs to invest some of their own capital in the new start-up, which will tie them to the project and make it harder for them to simply abandon the idea.

15.21. $1,222,000

15.23. $68,700,000; $15,300,000

15.25.

$130,000,000
$120,500,000
$9,500,000
15.27. The cost of borrowing is 6.52%. Since the economy is supposed to improve, the interest rates are expected to go up in the near future, which could make the cost of borrowing more expensive. Time is of the essence in this case.

Chapter 16
16.1. The inability of individual investors to borrow and lend at the same rate as firms, which goes against the assumption that there are no information or transactions costs, is analogous to the dull knife. Since the process of rearranging the claims on the firm’s assets is similar to carving up the firm into different pieces, it is easy to see that the market friction produced by the disparity between individual investors and firms is similar to the effect of the dull knife in our pie example.

16.3. Under Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition 1, the value of the firm is independent of the proportion of debt and equity it utilizes.

16.5. 20%

16.7. 18%

16.9. $150,000,000

16.11. 11.1%

16.13. 42%

16.15. The assumption that there are no information or transaction costs means, for example, that individuals can borrow and lend at the same rate as firms. If an investor could not sell (or buy) shares by investing (or borrowing) without transaction costs, then some of the value conserved in the Modigliani and Miller arguments through personal trading would be dissipated by transaction costs. This dissipation would then negate the conservation of value proposed by M&M.

16.17. $530,000,000

16.19. If the employees of a firm understand that the firm has a significant chance of filing for bankruptcy, then costs to the firm could be manifested in a number of ways, including:

Lower productivity due to lower morale and job hunting. This could be as simple as employees spending time gossiping about what is going to happen to them as well as employees actively pursuing other jobs while on the payroll of the troubled firm.
Higher recruiting costs. Understanding that working for the firm is a risky venture, new employees will seek compensation for this additional risk. Therefore, recruiting employees will become more expensive due to greater recruiting efforts as well as greater compensation expense when a new employee is finally located and hired.
16.21. Managers expect to lose their jobs in one year whether they work hard or not and take the project or not. Although there may be a slim chance that the firm will not declare bankruptcy, management has no incentive to take on the difficult project. This makes the shortage to the debt holders, as well as the stockholders, greater than it would be if the firm followed the rule of always accepting positive NPV projects. This is another example of agency costs that can arise from financial distress.

16.23. If we hold all other things equal, then the tax shield would become more valuable in the scenarios with positive debt amounts. While we cannot say for certain, given the information in the question, an increase in the tax rate will increase the value of the tax shield and should increase the amount of debt in the optimal capital structure. Therefore, it would appear that an increase in the tax rate should motivate firms to increase their debt levels.

16.25. The internally generated equity is utilized first as a source of financing, but it does not mean that the internally generated funds are cheaper than debt. Internally generated funds belong to stockholders and, therefore, are really equity financing, which is riskier and more expensive than debt. However, using internally generated funds enables the firm to avoid the costs associated with borrowing or selling stock (including the costs associated with the signals that financing announcements send investors), which, in turn, can make internal funds most attractive.

16.27. In the absence of information or transaction costs and any effect of debt on the real investment policy of the firm, the value of the firm is increasing in proportion to debt in the firm’s capital structure, due to the present value of the tax shield on the debt. Therefore, although operating without debt may be a safer play for investors, it does not maximize stockholder value, which should be the goal of managers.

16.29. $810,000,000

16.31. The root of the problem is that the firm’s management is too comfortable, because the weekly trip to Cancun is not costly enough to the managers of the firm. PolyAna could drastically increase the proportion of debt in the firm’s capital structure. This would decrease the amount of “free” cash that PolyAna’s managers could spend on their weekly outings. If enough debt is placed on this firm, then a cash shortage, or lack of a large cash surplus, would necessitate that the managers work on new positive NPV projects rather than spend their Fridays in Cancun.

16.33. $3,250,000; $2,250,000; kcs and WACC before restructuring both equal 10%; after restructuring, kcs = 11.33% and WACC = 9.23%

16.35. The correct answer is a, new debt is preferable to new equity.

Chapter 17
17.1. Since dividends convey information concerning the future prospects of the firm, any change in dividend levels is also believed to convey a change in management’s forecast of the firm’s prospects. That is, lowering the dividend from $0.25 to $0.20 suggests that the firm’s future cash flow may be reduced. This reduction could be because of a generally reduced level of profitability, because the firm’s projects are winding down, or even because of an increased need to invest in new positive NPV projects for the future.

17.3. The proper chronological order is: (1) declaration date: the day the dividend payment was announced, (2) ex-dividend date: the first day you can buy shares and not receive the dividend, (3) record date: the day shareholders of record receive the dividend when it is paid, and (4) payment date: the date when the dividend is actually paid.

17.5. We have to remember that any cash paid to shareholders reduces the amount that is available to bondholders in the event of bankruptcy. Because bondholders are aware of this potential problem, they should then restrict the amount of cash that can be paid to shareholders to at least a level where bondholders will still be able to generate their expected rate of return.

17.7. $9.75

17.9. A share repurchase, if followed through by management, will place the same amount of cash in the hands of its shareholders. However, since shareholders have the option of selling their shares or holding their shares, the repurchase leaves it up to the individual shareholders whether or not they would like to receive the cash. The dividend payment method will effectively force the shareholders to receive the cash.

17.11. The no-transaction-costs assumption is required for investors to create their own homemade dividends or for investors to “undo” their unwanted dividend payments by purchasing additional shares of the company stock. Therefore, by relaxing the no-transaction-costs assumption, we would increase the cost of producing the homemade dividend or the cost of undoing the unwanted dividends, which would then make dividend policy a relevant factor in valuing shares. For instance, receiving an unwanted dividend would now make it more costly to convert that dividend into new shares, since part of that dividend would be dissipated to transaction costs. In that situation, the investor would value a non-dividend-paying share higher than a dividend-paying share.

17.13. The value of a dividend received, after taxes are included, will be less than before. Therefore, we would expect the value of dividend-paying stocks to decrease relative to non-dividend-paying stocks.

17.15. When a firm reduces its dividend, the firm is telling the market that it does not have sufficient cash, which is of course a bad or negative signal. However, by increasing the dividend, the firm is telling its investors that it has more cash than it has investment uses for that cash. If the firm is currently viewed as a growth firm, then the market could interpret an increase in the dividend as a slowdown in the growth rate of the firm precipitated by the firm’s lower investment rate.

17.17. You would prefer that the firm initiate a share repurchase. You can opt not to sell your shares to the firm but still participate in the increased value of the firm’s shares, since your pro-rata share of the expected future cash flows generated by the firm will increase. You would not like a dividend payment, since you would then be required to receive the cash if you owned the shares at the time of the record date.

17.19. To understand this argument, we have to consider two points. First, the firm should be managed for the benefit of its shareholders. Second, the firm is the ultimate insider concerning the value of its shares. Given the above points, we must realize that any time the firm is purchasing its shares, it must be doing so because the firm’s management believes that the firm’s shares are undervalued. Therefore, by purchasing its shares, the firm is utilizing its inside information to purchase shares and ultimately to take advantage of the current owner of those shares in order to benefit the remaining shareholders of the firm. It is then not doing something in the interest of all of its shareholders since those who sell will be selling at a price lower than what they could have realized had they held their shares until the repurchase was complete.

17.21. (1) Open-market purchase—the firm simply purchases the shares in the market; (2) tender offer—the firm makes an offer through a general announcement, offering to buy up to a certain number of shares from anyone who wishes to sell (either the fixed-price or Dutch auction method can be used for a tender offer) (3) targeted share repurchases—the firm directly negotiates with an individual shareholder to buy shares from that individual.

17.23. The purpose of setting the number of days between the ex-dividend date and the record date is to allow for a sale of securities to clear in order to determine which “owner” is entitled to the dividend. Since the settlement period was reduced from five days to two days, we should have seen the number of days between the ex-dividend date and the record date to be reduced from four days to two.

17.25. If the firm has been successful over the last 10 years, then the value of its equity has increased but the total value of its debt has not increased accordingly. Therefore, the debt-to-equity ratio of the firm has been dropping. As a result of paying a dividend, the value of the equity, after the dividend is paid, will drop relative to that of the debt. This will help the firm to balance its debt-equity ratio and get closer to a 50%–50% percent mix (assume that the debt was below the 50% level to begin with).

17.27. $15

17.29. $72,500

17.31. $150,000

17.33. You can do this by paying out some of the cash that the firm has accumulated using either a special dividend or a stock repurchase. A special dividend can be completed quickly, but would subject your stockholders to taxes if they are not tax-exempt organizations or stockholders who wanted to retain the same dollar investment in your firm.

Chapter 18
18.1. The closer the type of organization is to the end of the list above, the better is its access to capital. Sole proprietorships must rely on equity contribution from the proprietor and debt or lease financing. In contrast, partnerships can turn to all of the partners for additional capital, and corporations can sell shares to both insiders and outsiders. Limited partnerships and limited liability companies (LLCs) are less constrained than general partnerships because they can raise money from limited partners or “members,” as outside investors in LLCs are called, who are not directly involved in running the business. C-corporations can have a virtually unlimited number of stockholders.

The forms of organizations discussed in this chapter include: sole proprietorship, partnership (general partnership and limited partnership), limited liability company (LLC), and corporations (S-corporation and C-corporation).

18.3. Sole proprietorships, general partnerships, and limited partnerships all are at a disadvantage. Sole proprietors and general partnerships face the possibility that their personal assets can be taken from them to satisfy claims against their businesses. In contrast, the liabilities of investors in limited partnerships, LLCs, and corporations are limited to the money that they have invested in the business.

18.5. You can try to raise additional equity financing from your friends and family, from venture capitalists, or from other potential investors that you know. Debt financing might be obtained through bank loans, cash advances on credit cards, or loans from other local individual investors or other businesses. Of course, if a company is large enough, equity and debt financing can be obtained in the public markets.

18.7. The replacement cost is the cost of duplicating the assets of a business in their present form, consisting of tangible and intangible assets as of the valuation date.

18.9. Excess cash is a nonoperating asset because, by definition, this cash can be distributed to stockholders without affecting the operations of the business and, therefore, the value of the expected future cash flows. It makes sense to add back the value of excess cash because it represents value over and above that which the business is expected to produce.

18.11. Shareholders in a private company may have to spend considerable resources in money and time to sell their shares. This additional transaction cost will make value derived from a similar publicly traded company an overestimated figure. Therefore, you will most likely not be willing to pay $12 a share. You can apply an appropriate marketability discount to this price as a fair price for this private equity.

18.13. An LLC is a hybrid of a limited partnership and a corporation. Like a corporation, an LLC provides limited liability for the people who make the business decisions in the firm while enabling all investors to retain the tax advantages of a limited partnership.

18.15. The break-even point for TV advertisement = 1,250 units. The break-even point for flyers = 150 units. Therefore, you should choose the flyer option.

18.17. $1,573.64 million

18.19. While the value estimates in the previous questions are reasonably similar, the enterprise value/EBITDA multiple is more appropriate for this analysis. The reason is that the capital structures of Johnson and Billy’s differ considerably, and the enterprise value/EBITDA multiple is less sensitive to differences in leverage.

18.21. $12,675,000

18.23. With $75,000 of capital invested in the initial period, the company will have negative cash balances during each of the first three months and positive cash balances in the following months. Additional capital investment totaling $9,400 will be needed to avoid negative cash balances in month 2. In other words, you will have to invest $84,400 of capital in total at the beginning of the business just to avoid negative cash balances. To maintain a minimum cash balance of $5,000, you will need to make an initial capital investment of $89,400 ($84,400 + $5,000).

The monthly break-even points for the firm are: 4,333.3 bottles in the initial month and 1,833.3 bottles in the following months.

18.25. See the key elements of a business plan in Section 18.2.

18.27. As discussed in the chapter, it is very difficult to value such a young firm with so many uncertainties. The company has a short history, high investments, no sales, and highly uncertain cash flows in the future. The cost approach is not valid for this company. It is hard to value the company using multiples analysis because of the lack of sales and negativity of earnings, and because of lack of comparable companies in the same business. The transaction analysis approach is also hard to apply.

Despite the many uncertainties, we should try to estimate the future cash flows and the risks associated with these cash flows. First of all, we need to estimate the probability and time length to achieve success in developing the product. In addition, we need to find out what happens in case the firm’s capital is used up before the product is developed. We need to decide whether, based on the company’s future prospects, it is possible to raise additional external capital at that point of time, and if not, we need to decide whether the business has any liquidation value. Then, we need to estimate the market demand and shares as well as target price of the product, in case it is developed successfully. We also need to estimate the short-term and long-term growth rate of the company based on market, industry, and firm-specific conditions.

18.29. 6.21%

18.31. VE = $354,230; your friend should receive 9.88% of the equity.

Chapter 19
19.1. The strategic plan is the blueprint for a company’s management that determines the firm’s long-term goals, identifies the strategies to achieve these goals, and determines the company’s ability to be competitive. It drives all decision making within the firm and covers all areas of a firm’s operations.

19.3. First, the financing plan identifies the amount of external financing needed and where the funds could be obtained. Second, the plan identifies the firm’s target capital structure. Last, the plan identifies the firm’s dividend policy, which directly affects the amount of funds available for new investment projects. The more funds the firm pays out as cash dividends, the more external funding it needs for its investments.

19.5. The important elements of financial modeling are the sales forecast, economic assumptions, pro forma statements, investment decisions, financing requirements, and the “plug factor” that determines the source of the external funds needed.

19.7. $52,686; 55%

19.9. Net sales $1,710; costs $399; net income $1,311

19.11. The capital intensity ratio measures the amount of assets needed to generate one dollar in sales. The higher the ratio, the more assets needed to generate every dollar of sales and, hence, the more capital intensive the firm. The reverse is also true.

19.13. 68.02%

19.19. Two industries that may be considered to be capital intensive are the electric utilities industry and the aluminum processing industry. There may be others as well.

Chapter 20
20.1. An option is the right to buy or sell an asset at a pre-specified price on or before a pre-specified date.

20.3. $0; $15

20.5. The value of a call option increases as: (1) current value of the underlying asset increases; (2) exercise price decreases; (3) volatility of the value of the underlying asset increases; (4) time until the expiration of the option increases; or (5) risk-free rate of interest increases.

20.7. The seller of an option hopes the option will not be exercised. In this case, the option will be exercised if the asset value at expiration is lower than the strike price, so the seller hopes the asset value will rise (or at least will remain above the strike price).

20.9. No. The seller of a call option can lose a theoretically unlimited amount of money because the value of the underlying asset can go arbitrarily high. The seller of a put option is limited to losing the amount of the strike price (since that is how much the seller would lose if the stock price went to zero).

20.11. Your option is worth very slightly more than zero. There is little chance that the stock price will move above $100 by tomorrow, but the chance is not zero, so the option still has some value.

20.13. The underlying asset of a financial option is a financial asset, while the underlying asset of a real option is a real asset like an investment project.

20.15. Agency costs arise because the incentives of shareholders are different from those of the debt holders. Equity and debt claims are like different types of options on the firm. The payoff function for the stockholders looks exactly like that for the owner of a call option, where the exercise price is the amount owed on the loan and the underlying asset is the firm itself. The payoff function for the lenders looks like that for the seller of a put option, where the exercise price is the amount of the loan and the underlying asset is the firm itself. The different payoff functions create different incentives for shareholders and debt holders. For example, shareholders are likely to pursue more risky projects. The increased volatility of cash flows increases the expected payout for the holder of a call option, the shareholder, and decreases the expected payout for the seller of a put option, the debt holder.

20.17. The purchaser of a callable bond is simultaneously selling the issuer a call option on that bond. The value is equal to the value of the straight bond minus the value of the option. This is clearly less than the value of the (noncallable) bond by itself.

20.19. Option writers receive the value of the option up front. The money the seller receives by selling the bond is referred to as the bond premium. This payment compensates them for the obligation they are taking on.

20.21. $7.01

20.23. $1.18

20.25. Managers have incentives to avoid bankruptcy or even underperformance because the personal cost to them is quite high. As a result, they may choose to avoid high-risk investments even if those investments have highly positive NPVs. The costs to the manager if the project goes badly outweigh the benefits if it goes well. However, stockholders want the manager to take positive-NPV projects, even if they are risky. Golden parachutes help to solve this problem by reducing the costs to the manager associated with poor performance or bankruptcy. The manager faces a payoff structure like that faced by the seller of an option. Golden parachutes serve to reduce the volatility of that option and therefore to reduce the value of the option.

20.27. The payoff of these two portfolios is identical.

20.29.

Both the debt and the equity are worth $5 million.
$6.5 million
$3.5 million
20.31. Call option 1 has a lower strike price and costs less. In a situation like this, you can earn an arbitrage opportunity by purchasing the less expensive option (#1) and selling the more expensive (#2).

20.33. It mitigates this concern because the lenders will benefit through the call option from increased volatility in the value of the firm. How much a conversion option mitigates this concern depends on the specific characteristics of the option.

The three-month forward rate on the Swiss franc is $1.13310/SF relative to the spot rate of $1.12630/SF. The forward premium (discount) = ($1.13310 – $1.12630)/$1.12630 = 0.604%. So there is a forward premium on the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar.
The three-month forward rate on the Japanese yen is $0.008754/¥, while the spot rate is $0.00872/¥. The forward premium (discount) = (0.008754 – 0. 0.00872)/0.00872 = 0.39%. The yen is at a forward premium against the U. S. dollar.
Given the data on forward rates in (a) and (b) above, we can expect the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen to appreciate relative to the U.S. dollar over the next three months.

Appendix C
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: Implications for Cash Flow to Investors, the Cost of Capital, and Capital Structure

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Describe the major federal tax law changes adopted under H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in 2017 and explain how these changes affect cash flow from operating activity and cash flow to investors.
Discuss and compute the impact of the 2017 federal tax law changes on the after-tax cost of debt and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a firm.
Explain how tax law changes can alter firm value and a firm’s capital structure decisions.
On the morning of December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed H.R. 1 into law, a tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill, which became effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, enacted sweeping changes in U.S. federal corporate tax policies and rates. In signing the legislation, President Trump described the tax bill as the “biggest reform of all time.”

At the time the legislation was signed, many companies declined to publicly comment on how the federal tax law changes would alter their businesses or stated that they were still trying to assess the overall effects of the various changes on their operations. Others, including FedEx Corporation, touted the bill as providing an incentive to modify the timing of their capital expenditures. Several companies, such as Coca-Cola and Chevron, also noted the important impact of lower corporate tax rates on their ability to compete with firms headquartered outside of the United States and increase their payouts to investors. While a number of the elements of the 2017 tax bill have received both criticism and praise, the modifications it brought to federal tax law have undoubtedly had an impact on a variety of decisions made by financial managers and the cash flow to their investors.

Appendix C Preview
This appendix to the 5th edition of Fundamentals of Corporate Finance uses the changes instituted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to review the role of taxes in determining the cash flows from operating activity and to investors, the cost of debt, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and, ultimately, a firm’s capital structure and financing choices.

For a profitable company, cash outflows to pay taxes are one of its most significant expenses, reducing cash flow from operating activity and, by extension, cash flow to investors. Corporations pay taxes to the municipalities in which they do business, including state and local governments, as well as the federal government. Federal tax policies are important for businesses, as they typically carry the highest statutory tax rate of any jurisdiction and allow pretax expensing of depreciation charges and interest payments. Because of this importance, changes in federal tax laws and statutory rates, such as those associated with the 2017 federal tax law, can have a significant impact on corporate policies and the cash flow to investors. We frame our discussion in the context of the 2017 legislation, which brought about the most dramatic changes in corporate tax rates in decades. It should also be noted, however, that the discussion here can be expanded to address the impact of any change in tax laws on corporate cash flows, the cost of capital, and capital structure. This is particularly important given recent discussions of additional corporate tax reforms by the Biden administration.

We begin our discussion of the impact of the 2017 federal tax law by analyzing how the replacement of progressive corporate income tax brackets with a flat 21 percent corporate tax rate affects cash flow to investors. We then extend our discussion to include two of the most important changes in the tax law, specifically (1) an expanded accelerated depreciation policy commonly referred to as “bonus depreciation” and (2) new limits to the deductibility of net business interest when computing pretax income. Next, we explain how the policy changes in the tax bill lowered the value of the interest tax shield and increased the cost of debt capital and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of levered firms. Finally, we examine how all these changes affect corporate financial policies and the value of the firm.

C.1 Corporate Taxes and Cash Flow to Investors
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Describe the major federal tax law changes adopted under H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in 2017 and explain how these changes affect cash flow from operating activity and cash flow to investors.
The adoption of H.R. 1 in December 2017 introduced sweeping changes in corporate tax rates and rules starting in the 2018 fiscal tax year. We focus on three changes in the tax laws that have an important impact on the cash flow from operating activity and to investors. These changes include the elimination of the progressive corporate tax rates used in prior tax years, as well as changes in the tax rules covering pretax expensing of depreciation and the deductibility of interest payments.

Corporate Tax Rates and Cash Flow to Investors
The most significant change associated with the 2017 federal tax legislation was the elimination of the progressive corporate income tax rates summarized in Exhibit C.1. As you can see, the marginal tax rate varied from 15 percent to 35 percent (column 3) on income earned by a company in 2017. In general, under this progressive tax system, companies with lower taxable incomes paid lower tax rates than larger companies with higher taxable incomes. Historically, this gave preferential treatment to small businesses and start-up companies as a means of stimulating new business formation.

EXHIBIT C.1 U.S. Federal Corporate Income Tax Rates for 2017

The federal corporate marginal tax rate varies from 15 to 35 percent. Generally speaking, smaller companies with lower taxable income have lower tax rates than larger companies with higher taxable incomes. Smaller businesses are given preferential treatment to encourage new business formation.

(1)	 	(2)	 	(3)	 	(4)
Corporations’ Taxable Income	Pay This Amount on the Base of the Bracket	Marginal Tax Rate: Tax Rate on the Excess Over the Base	Average Tax Rate at Top of Bracket
$0–$50,000	 	$0	 	15%	 	15.0%
50,001–75,000	  7,500	25	18.3
75,001–10,000,000	13,750	34	33.9
More than 10,000,000	22,250	35	33.9
Under the new law, these income-based tax brackets have been replaced by a single “flat” corporate rate of 21 percent, which applies to taxable income earned beginning in 2018. The 21 percent tax rate is applied to every dollar of taxable income; thus, both the marginal and the average corporate federal rates will be a constant 21 percent. It is important to note that since many local and state taxes are still determined using progressive tax rates, corporate income will continue to be subject to varying “blended” marginal tax rates that are determined by the combined application of federal, state, and local tax rates.

To see the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on a firm’s cash flows, let’s compute the 2017 tax bill for a corporation with taxable income of $150,000. This tax calculation involves three distinct rate brackets shown in Exhibit C.1, and the firm has a total tax bill of $39,250. The average tax rate is 26.2 percent ($39,250/$150,000 = 0.262, or 26.2 percent) and the firm’s marginal tax rate, which is the rate paid on the last dollar earned, is 35 percent.

How does this 2017 tax bill compare with the tax bill for a company that has an identical taxable income of $150,000 in 2018 and is subject to the new 21 percent constant tax rate? With the new rate, the firm’s total tax bill is computed as 0.21 × $150,000 = $31,500, and both the corresponding average and marginal tax rates are $31,500/$150,000 = 0.21, or 21 percent. Note that the 2018 tax bill is $7,750 lower than the 2017 tax bill.

A change in federal tax rates can have an important impact on the cash flows to investors. In the marginal rates outlined in Exhibit C.1, note that the lowest marginal rate applied in the past was 15 percent, which is lower than the new flat rate of 21 percent. This suggests that, all else equal, firms in the lowest bracket of taxable income have faced a higher tax bill and a lower cash flow from operating activity since 2018. Beyond the first $50,000 of taxable income, however, firms pay a lower marginal tax rate for each additional dollar of taxable income under the new flat rate. Under the progressive tax system that was in place during 2017, a firm with taxable earnings of $90,384 paid an average tax rate of exactly 21 percent.1 Firms with taxable earnings above (below) this amount now have lower (higher) federal tax bills with the application of the 21 percent flat rate. Since the average (median) U.S. public company reported taxable income of $629.12 million ($64.06 million) in the 2017 fiscal year, implementation of the flat 21 percent rate lowered taxes and increased the cash flow to investors for most U.S. public companies.

Learning by Doing Application C.1 presents another example of how the implementation of a 21 percent flat corporate tax rate can affect the corporate tax bill for a firm.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION C.1
Calculating Tax Rates

Problem

The chief financial officer of Balsa Chemicals Inc. forecasts that the company’s taxable income in the next fiscal year will be $96,980. Estimate the expected federal tax bill for the company in the next fiscal year applying a flat 21 percent corporate rate. How does this figure compare to the federal tax bill Balsa would have paid on the same level of taxable income in 2017? What is the company’s marginal tax rate under the two different tax regimes?





Bonus Depreciation and the Cash Flow to Investors
As discussed in Chapter 11, depreciation expenses are commonly estimated using a straight-line depreciation schedule for financial reporting and the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) for tax purposes. While these methods allow for the same amount of cumulative depreciation over the life of an asset, using accelerated depreciation for tax purposes allows for greater depreciation expensing early in the life of an asset, which increases the present value of the depreciation tax shield.

While depreciation itself is a noncash expense, it has an important impact on a firm’s cash flow from operating activity (CFOA) because it reduces a firm’s current taxable income. In Chapter 3, we saw that CFOA can be written as Equation 3.4:

Cash flow to investors (CFI) is equal to CFOA minus cash flow invested in net working capital (CFNWC) and long-term assets (CFLTA):

Thus, the impact of depreciation on CFOA directly affects CFI.

For most businesses, the largest noncash expenses are depreciation and amortization of long-term assets. Recall that we add back noncash expenses in the calculation of CFOA because no cash is actually being paid out when the firm accounts for the expense on the income statement. For example, a depreciation charge does not reflect a cash outflow in the current period; the cash outflow actually took place when the asset was purchased.

In addition to modifying corporate tax rates, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act implemented a number of changes that affect the recognition of pretax expenses. One of the most important changes was the expansion of the “bonus depreciation” policy, which allows for a significant first-year depreciation deduction for qualified assets. Under the 2017 Act, firms are allowed to recognize 100 percent of the depreciation expense for an asset in the first year of its use, doubling the 50 percent bonus depreciation that was previously allowed by the tax law. This expansion of bonus depreciation will only be in full effect through 2022, as it is scheduled to decline over time for assets acquired in 2023 and beyond.

Bonus depreciation has a positive impact on CFOA for firms that are investing in long-term assets. With 100 percent depreciation, firms are able to fully deduct the cost of a fixed asset in the year of the investment and thus do not have to defer any of the tax benefits of depreciation to later years. Given the time value of money, the positive cash flow implications of bonus depreciation can be substantial for firms, particularly for those with many assets whose depreciable lives extend over a long period of time.

To see the magnitude of the cash flow effects of accelerated depreciation, let’s consider an example. Assume that in 2021 Diaz Manufacturing (from Chapters 3 and 4) expands its output of valves and compressors by investing $40 million in a new manufacturing facility. Diaz Manufacturing’s auditor has determined that the new facility is a qualified investment and that the firm can recognize the full expense of this facility on its 2021 income statement. With a $40 million depreciation expense, and a 21 percent tax rate, Diaz Manufacturing’s federal tax bill will be $8.4 million (0.21 × $40 million = $8.4 million) lower than if it had no depreciation expense at all. This lower tax bill results in a 2021 CFOA that is $8.4 million larger.

Now, let’s compare the cash flow effect of bonus depreciation to the cash flows if the manufacturing facility is depreciated under a simple eight-year straight-line schedule. Under a straight-line schedule, Diaz would be allowed to expense $5 million per year in depreciation ($40 million/8 years = $5 million per year) for tax purposes. With a $5 million annual depreciation expense, Diaz Manufacturing’s tax obligations for the eight years beginning in 2021 will be $1.05 million lower than if the company had no depreciation expense for the new facility (0.21 × $5 million = $1.05 million). It is important to note that the cash flow benefit from straight-line depreciation accrues as an eight-year annuity due. If Diaz Manufacturing applies a 12 percent discount rate to its cash flow from operating activity, the present value of the tax benefits from straight-line depreciation can be calculated using Equation 6.3, as follows:

The present value of the incremental cash flows attributable to this straight-line depreciation schedule can be compared directly with the cash flow obtained under the 100 percent bonus depreciation schedule above. This comparison tells us that the bonus depreciation increases the present value of Diaz Manufacturing’s CFOA by $2.56 million ($8.4 million – $5.84 million = $2.56 million) relative to the eight-year straight-line schedule!

You might think that the bonus depreciation policy could also affect the cash flow invested in long-term assets (CFLTA), which is defined in Equation 3.6 as:

However, this is not the case. To see this, let’s review the impact of the acquisition of a long-term asset on the balance sheet. Diaz Manufacturing is expanding its manufacturing capacity with a $40 million investment. To ensure that the balance sheet accurately reflects this investment, Diaz Manufacturing will increase the gross plant and equipment line of the balance sheet by $40 million regardless of how the assets are depreciated. If the firm also applies 100 percent bonus depreciation to this investment, accumulated depreciation will also increase by $40 million, and net plant and equipment will be unchanged by this investment. In contrast, with less or no bonus depreciation, net plant and equipment will increase. However, as you may recall, we ignore accumulated depreciation when computing CFLTA and thus the choice of the depreciation schedule will not affect the calculation of CFLTA.

Interest Deduction and Cash Flow to Investors
The deductibility of interest expense for tax purposes is a very important benefit associated with the use of debt. As discussed in Chapter 3, all else equal, the deduction of interest as a pretax expense creates an interest tax shield for the firm. The ability to expense interest reduces taxes and increases CFOA and therefore CFI. The 2017 federal tax legislation altered the rules regarding the deductibility of interest paid by corporations on their debt. This important change limits the amount of interest that can be deducted when estimating a firm’s tax obligation, thereby reducing the size of the interest tax shield for some highly levered firms.

For tax years prior to 2018, there was no limit on the dollar amount of interest that could be deducted when calculating a firm’s tax obligation. For example, if a firm paid $1,000,000 of interest in a given year, the entire amount could be deducted when computing pretax profits. If the firm’s profits before interest and taxes were less than $1,000,000, then the firm would generate a tax loss that could be carried back or forward in time and applied against profits to reduce taxable income in another period. If the firm’s profits before interest and taxes exceeded $1,000,000, then its taxable income would be the difference between profits before interest and taxes and interest paid.

For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the 2017 federal tax legislation places a limit on the dollar amount of net interest that can be deducted before tax. Under the new rules, a firm’s deduction for net business interest (interest expense minus interest income) is limited to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income (ATI), which is a measure of pretax operating cash flow, EBITDA, in the current year.2

While the limits on the deductibility of interest will not have a significant impact on the CFOA for companies with little debt, it can reduce the CFOA and CFI for highly levered firms. In 2017, approximately 13 percent of publicly traded firms in the United States reported a ratio of net interest expense to EBITDA greater than 30 percent; thus, this feature of the 2017 federal tax bill would, all else equal, have resulted in a lower CFOA in 2017 for more than one out of every ten public firms had it been in effect.

To illustrate the impact that the limit on the deductibility of interest can have on CFOA and CFI, let’s consider a C-corporation with some debt in its capital structure and a 25 percent overall tax rate (including federal, state, and local taxes). The line items (in millions of dollars) in the following income statement are determined using the tax code that predates passage of the 2017 federal tax legislation:

Revenue	$100.0
Cost of goods sold	60.0
Depreciation	10.0
Net business interest expense	20.0
Pretax income	$ 10.0
Federal, state, and local tax at 25%	2.5
Net income	$ 7.5
In the above income statement, the firm deducts the full amount of net business interest paid during the fiscal year, and the interest tax shield is $5 million (0.25 × $20 million = $5 million). This reduction in the tax bill increased CFOA by an amount equal to the value of the interest tax shield.

Under the new rules for interest deductibility, the same firm would face a limit on the deductibility of interest that equals 30 percent of adjusted taxable income. The dollar value of this limit in the above example can be computed for the firm by first computing its ATI:

Pretax income under old tax rules	$10.0
Plus net business interest expense	20.0
Plus depreciation	10.0
Adjusted taxable income (ATI)	$40.0
Next, we multiply the $40 million of ATI by 0.30 to find that the firm can deduct only $12 million (0.30 × $40 million = $12 million) of the net business interest paid in the fiscal year when computing its federal taxes. With a 25 percent overall tax rate, if we assume for simplicity that the new deduction limit also applies to state and local taxes, the interest tax shield for the fiscal year is $3 million (0.25 × $12 million = $3 million), which is $2 million less than the tax shield under the previous federal tax law. From this example, it is clear that the 2017 federal tax legislation lowered the expected value of the interest tax shield for firms with net interest expense greater than 30 percent of ATI.

C.2 Corporate Taxes and the Cost of Capital
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Discuss and compute the impact of the 2017 federal tax law changes on the after-tax cost of debt and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a firm.
As we discussed in Section C.1, the 2017 federal tax legislation introduced a number of important changes in corporate tax rates and polices, including a limit on the net business interest expense that can be deducted when computing a C-corporation’s tax liability. This section discusses how to calculate the impact of the changes in corporate tax rates and the limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense on the cost of the debt capital and a firm’s overall weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

Corporate Tax Rates and the After-Tax Cost of Debt
As noted in Chapter 13, managers are concerned about the after-tax cost of the capital they obtain from their investors. This cost of capital for the firm can be measured as the weighted average of the costs of the different types of financing used by the firm. Virtually all firms use some form of debt financing, and the 2017 federal tax legislation changed the after-tax cost of debt financing for most firms. This concept is important because the actual cost of debt for a firm is lower if the government provides a tax break for interest expenses. More generally, the after-tax cost of debt is equal to the pretax cost times 1 minus the tax rate, t. To incorporate the effect of this tax break, the after-tax cost of debt is calculated in Equation 13.3 as:

As we noted in Section C.1, the establishment of a flat 21 percent federal tax rate by the 2017 federal tax legislation reduced the average tax rate for the majority of public companies in the United States. The implication of this change in the corporate tax rate is clear for the after-tax cost of debt. By reducing the corporate tax rate, the after-tax cost of debt increased for most firms. This is not because the actual cost of debt increased for firms, but because the benefit associated with the ability to deduct interest from pretax earnings is lower with a lower tax rate.

Interest Deduction and the After-Tax Cost of Debt
While the after-tax cost of debt increases as the tax rate decreases, the after-tax cost of debt can also be affected by limitations on the deductibility of interest when computing pretax income. The new tax provision that limits the net business interest expense deduction to 30 percent of the firm’s ATI reduced the value of the interest tax shield for firms that are affected by the 30 percent limit.

The impact that the 30 percent limit can have on the cash flows to investors at a highly levered firm is illustrated in Section C.1 for a corporation that has the following income statement under the old tax law (amounts are in millions of dollars).

Revenue	$100.0
Cost of goods sold	60.0
Depreciation	10.0
Net business interest expense	20.0
Pretax income	$ 10.0
Federal and state tax at 25%	2.5
Net income	$ 7.5
Let’s review these calculations and then extend them to illustrate the implications for cost of capital calculations.

Enactment of the 2017 federal tax legislation caused the above corporation’s net business interest deduction to decline from $20.0 million to $12.0 million. This is because the firm has an ATI of $40.0 million and 30 percent of $40.0 million equals $12.0 million ($40.0 million × 30 percent = $12.0 million).

With a 25 percent overall tax rate, this $8.0 million decline in the net business interest deduction increases the taxes that the firm must pay by $2.0 million ($8.0 million × 25 percent = $2.0 million) and decreases its net income (and cash flows to investors) by the same amount.3 The firm’s income statement after enactment of the 2017 legislation would be as follows:

Revenue	$100.0
Cost of goods sold	60.0
Depreciation	10.0
Net business interest expense	20.0
Pretax income	$ 10.0
Federal and state tax at 25%	4.5
Net income	$ 5.5
The $2.0 million tax increase also represents an increase in the cost of debt to the firm. For example, if the firm just issued debt with a market value of $400 million, a $2.0 million increase in taxes raises the after-tax percentage cost of debt by 0.5 percent ($2.0 million/$400.0 million = 0.005, or 0.5 percent).

To better understand how the limit on the deductibility of business interest under the 2017 federal tax legislation affected the cost of debt for the firm in our example, let’s calculate the after-tax cost of debt under the rules that existed before and after the legislation was enacted. For ease of exposition, we will keep the overall tax rate fixed at 25 percent in both examples to highlight only the effects of limits to the deductibility of net business interest.

After-Tax Cost of Debt Before the 2017 Federal Tax Legislation

We first calculate the pretax cost of debt, which is simply the annual net business interest expense of $20.0 million divided by $400.0 million.4 This pretax percentage cost equals 5.0 percent ($20.0 million/$400.0 million = 0.050, or 5.0 percent). Prior to the 2017 federal tax legislation, we could simply use the pretax cost of debt and the 25 percent tax rate in Equation 13.3 to calculate the after-tax cost of debt as follows:

Given the after-tax percentage cost of debt, we can calculate the corresponding after-tax dollar cost of debt to be $15.0 million (0.0375 × $400.0 million = $15.0 million). This is the actual cost of debt capital for the firm.

After-Tax Cost of Debt After the 2017 Federal tax Legislation

Under the 2017 federal tax legislation, the tax benefits of debt are limited because firms can deduct only net business interest equal to 30 percent of the firm’s ATI. For a firm with net business interest expense less than 30 percent of its ATI, the 2017 legislation will have no impact on the after-tax cost of debt relative to the prior policy of unlimited interest deductibility. However, for a firm with interest expense exceeding 30 percent of ATI, as is the case in this example, the computation of the after-tax cost of debt can be accomplished as follows:

First, calculate the maximum allowable net business interest deduction:

where:

Second, calculate the percentage of total net business interest expense that is deductible:

where:

Third, calculate the percentage tax shield under the 2017 federal tax legislation:

where:

Finally, calculate the after-tax cost of debt:

We have presented the individual steps taken to derive the after-tax cost of debt with limits on the deduction of interest from pretax earnings to help illustrate the intuition behind this computation. Fortunately, the calculations above can be combined into a single formula:

(C.1)
We only use Equation C.1 for calculations when the limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense affects the taxes that the firm pays (e.g., when its net business interest expense is more than 30 percent of its ATI). If the net business interest expense paid by the firm is less than or equal to 30 percent of its ATI, then we should use Equation 13.3 to calculate the firm’s after-tax cost of debt.

Now that we have derived the after-tax percentage cost of debt, we can calculate the corresponding dollar cost of debt after tax to be $17.0 million (0.0425 × $400.0 million = $17.0 million). This is the actual cost of debt capital for the firm when the pretax interest deduction is limited to 30 percent of ATI. In comparing the after-tax dollar cost of debt capital before and after the 2017 federal tax legislation, we can see that the limits on the deduction of interest from pretax earnings increased the dollar cost of debt for the firm by $2 million (from $15 million to $17 million). This figure corresponds to the firm’s increase in taxes resulting from an $8 million decline in the net interest deduction under the 2017 tax bill ($8.0 million × 25 percent = $2.0 million).

It is important to note that the reduction in the federal tax rate and the limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense only affect a firm’s overall cost of capital through their impact on the firm’s after-tax cost of debt. In other words, these characteristics of the 2017 federal tax legislation only affect kDebt pretax(1–t) in Equation 13.7:

They do not affect the costs of preferred or common stock.

Learning by Doing Application C.2 provides another example of the after-tax cost of debt with a limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense when computing pretax earnings. The application features multiple sources of debt financing and can be compared to Learning by Doing Application 13.2.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION C.2
Calculating the Cost of Debt

Problem

You have just successfully completed a leveraged buyout of the firm that you have been working for. To finance this $35 million transaction, you and three partners put up a total of $10 million in equity capital, and you borrowed $25 million from banks and other investors. The bank debt consists of $10 million of secured debt borrowed at a rate of 6 percent from Bank of America and $7 million of senior unsecured debt borrowed at a rate of 7 percent from JPMorgan Chase. The remaining $8 million was borrowed from an investment group managed by a private equity firm. The rate on this subordinated (junior) unsecured debt is 9.5 percent. What is the overall after-tax cost of the debt financing used to buy the firm under the 2017 federal tax legislation if you expect the firm’s adjusted taxable income (ATI) to equal $3 million and its average and marginal tax rates to both be 25 percent?





C.3 Capital Structure and the Impact of Changing Taxes
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain how tax law changes can alter firm value and a firm’s capital structure decisions.
As discussed in Section C.1, for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the 2017 federal tax legislation establishes a single corporate tax rate of 21 percent and places a limit on the dollar amount of net business interest expense that can be deducted when computing a firm’s tax obligation. Under the new rules, the tax deduction for net business interest expense is limited to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income (ATI), which is a measure of pretax operating cash flow, EBITDA, in the current year. From 2022 forward, the measure of ATI is scheduled to change from EBITDA to EBIT, suggesting an even greater limit on the deductibility of interest for firms with high depreciation and amortization expenses.

This section explores the implications of taxes and the 2017 federal tax legislation for a firm’s capital structure, value, and cost of capital. To see the effects that come into play, we first focus on the consequence of the lower tax rate on firm value and then incorporate the impact of the limit on interest deductibility. Finally, we look at how the tax reforms influence the cost of equity and weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

Corporate Tax Rates and the Value of the Firm with Debt
Recall from Chapter 16 that the trade-off theory of capital structure suggests that a firm’s managers trade off the costs and benefits of debt to maximize firm value. The tax savings associated with being able to deduct interest expense when computing pretax earnings, commonly referred to as the interest tax shield, is a key benefit of having debt in a firm’s capital structure. When a firm with little or no debt adds more debt, the tax shield arising from being able to deduct interest payments results in a reduction in the tax paid to the government, which increases the value of the firm’s cash flows that are received by the stockholders. In Section 16.2, we showed that when an all-equity firm adds debt, firm value increases by the present value of the interest tax shield. For perpetual debt, this change in value can be estimated using Equation 16.4 as follows:

As we noted in Section C.1, the imposition of a flat 21 percent federal tax rate lowered the average tax rate for the majority of public companies in the United States, resulting in increased after-tax cash flows and firm value. The lower tax rate also means that the value of the tax shield declined, but the amount of this decline will be smaller than the increase in value that results from the reduction in the tax rate. Thus, overall, firms with debt in their capital structure benefit from the lower tax rate. To examine the changes in firm value and WACC that take place with a lower tax rate, let’s revisit the Millennium Motors discussion in Section 16.2 and Exhibit 16.7 of the text.

In the first column of Exhibit 16.7, included below, we see that with zero debt Millennium Motors’ entire annual EBIT of $100 million is taxable at a 28 percent rate. (As we noted in Section C.1, companies pay state and local taxes in addition to the federal tax rate; thus, the blended tax rate actually paid is typically greater than 21 percent.) This leaves $72 million available for payment as dividends to stockholders [$100 million × (1 − 0.28) = $72 million]. Using the perpetuity formula and a 10 percent discount rate, the value of the unleveraged firm is $720 million ($72 million/0.10 = $720 million). In column 2, the value of the interest tax shield associated with new perpetual debt of $200 million is $56 million (D × t = $200 million × 0.28 = $56 million). Thus, firm value at the new debt level is $776 million, which is equal to the value of a firm that has no leverage plus the $56 million tax shield.

EXHIBIT 16.7 The Effect of Taxes on the Firm Value and WACC of Millennium Motors

The value of Millennium Motors increases and its WACC decreases with the amount of debt in the capital structure. The calculations assume that the cost of debt remains constant regardless of the amount of leverage and that the second and third M&M conditions apply.

Total debt
$0	$200	$400	$600	$800
Cost of debt	5.00%	5.00%	5.00%	5.00%	5.00%

Value of equity	$720.00	$576.00	$432.00	$288.00	$144.00
Cost of equity	10.00%	11.25%	13.33%	17.50%	30.00%
Firm value	$720.00	$776.00	$832.00	$888.00	$944.00
WACC	10.00%	9.28%	8.65%	8.11%	7.63%
In Exhibit C.2, we repeat the analysis above, but we now assume the tax rate for Millennium Motors is only the 21 percent federal tax rate to illustrate the impact of lower tax rates on the value of the firm. With zero debt, the firm’s after-tax cash flows would be $79 million per year [$100 million × (1 − 0.21) = $79 million]. Using the perpetuity formula, and assuming a 10 percent discount rate, the value of the unleveraged firm is $790 million ($79 million/0.10 = $790 million). Consistent with the discussion in Section C.1, paying less in taxes results in more cash flow to investors and increases in the value of Millennium Motors from $720 million with a 28 percent tax rate to $790 million.

EXHIBIT C.2 The Effect of Taxes on the Firm Value and WACC of Millennium Motors with a 21 Percent Tax Rate and No Limit on Interest Deductibility

The value of Millennium Motors and the value of equity are higher at every debt level when the tax rate declines to 21 percent. The calculations assume that the cost of debt remains constant regardless of the amount of leverage and that the second and third M&M conditions apply.

Total debt

Cost of equity	10.00%	11.25%	13.33%	17.50%	30.00%
Firm value	$790.00	$832.00	$874.00	$916.00	$958.00
WACC	10.00%	9.50%	9.04%	8.62%	8.25%
The second column of Exhibit C.2 illustrates the impact of the 21 percent tax rate on the value Millennium Motors with $200 million in perpetual debt. In this case, the value of the interest tax shield is $42 million ($200 million × 0.21 = $42 million). The total value of the firm is $832 million, which can be calculated as the value of the unleveraged firm plus the value of the tax shield ($790 million + $42 million = $832 million). Even though the value of the tax shield has fallen from $56 million at the tax rate of 28 percent to $42 million at the 21 percent rate, the value of the firm has increased from $760 million to $832 million because of the lower total tax payment.

If we compare the values in Exhibit 16.7 with those in Exhibit C.1, we can see that as debt increases, the tax bill paid by the firm is lower and the value of the firm is higher under the 21 percent tax rate. At the same time, for a given level of debt the proportion of debt in the capital structure is lower at the 21 percent tax rate, as firm value has increased. For example, when debt is $600 million and the tax rate is 28 percent, firm value is $888 million and the debt to value ratio is 67.5 percent ($600 million/$888 million = 0.675, or 67.5 percent). But at the 21 percent tax rate, with $600 million debt, firm value is $916 million and the debt to value ratio drops to 65.5 percent ($600 million/$916 million = 0.655, or 65.5 percent). In contrast, the cost of equity is the same under the two tax rates.5 Overall, while the reduction in the tax rate results in a lower interest tax shield, this is more than offset by the benefit from paying lower taxes.

Interest Deduction Limit, Payments to Investors, and the Value of the Firm
So far in this section, we have assumed that net business interest expense is fully deductible when computing pretax earnings. However, as we discussed in section C.2, the 2017 federal tax legislation limits the pretax net business interest deduction to 30 percent of ATI. For firms with net business interest expense below the 30 percent threshold, the limit to the deductibility of interest does not apply. However, when the interest on debt is above 30 percent of ATI, firms will effectively lose a portion of the tax shield, as some part of the interest payment is no longer deductible for tax purposes.6

Millennium Motors has no depreciation or amortization expense, so the firm’s EBIT and EBITDA are equal. Therefore, both of these pretax operating profit and cash flow measures are the same and equal to ATI in this example. Under the 2017 federal tax legislation, Millennium’s deductible interest is limited to 30 percent of ATI, or $30 million (0.3 × $100 million = $30 million), which is exactly equal to the interest owed by the firm when it has $600 million in debt.

To see what happens to firm value and WACC with the limit on pretax interest expense, let’s consider the case in which Millennium Motors issues perpetual debt of $800 million and a flat tax rate of 21 percent is applied to taxable income. This analysis appears in Exhibit C.3. Note that in the first four columns the values are the same as those in Exhibit C.2. This is because Millennium’s interest is fully deductible at these debt levels.

If we compare the values in the last column of Exhibit C.3 with those in the last column of Exhibit C.2, we see that when Millennium has $800 million of debt, the value of the firm drops from $958 million to $916 million. In contrast, the WACC increases from 8.25 percent in Exhibit C.2 to 8.62 percent in Exhibit C.3. The fact that interest on debt above $600 million is no longer deductible accounts for these differences.

EXHIBIT C.3 The Effect of Taxes on the Firm Value and WACC of Millennium Motors with a 21 Percent Tax Rate and a Limit on Interest Deductibility

The value of Millennium Motors and the value of equity are lower when there is a limit on the deductibility of interest payments. The calculations assume that the cost of debt remains constant regardless of the amount of leverage and that the second and third M&M conditions apply.

WACC	10.00%	9.50%	9.04%	8.62%	8.62%	8.62%
Let’s now look in more detail at how we calculate the values for Millennium Motors in Exhibit C.3. When debt is $800 million and the cost of debt is 5 percent, Millennium must pay interest of $40 million (0.05 × $800 million = $40 million). However, under the new tax policy, the firm can only deduct $30 million of net business interest expense when computing its taxes. The amount of earnings before taxes is thus $70 million ($100 million – $30 million = $70 million) and the firm has to pay taxes of $14.70 million (0.21 × $70 million = $14.70 million). This figure compares with a tax payment of $12.60 million when there is no limit on net business interest expense, as in Exhibit C.2. The firm is paying an additional $2.10 million ($14.70 million – $12.60 million = $2.10 million) in taxes each year with the limit on the deductibility of interest expense.

What does this mean for the payments to debt and equity holders? When net business interest expense is fully deductible, the after-tax cash flow of $47.40 million can be paid to the stockholders of Millennium Motors as a dividend. With limited deductibility, however, Millennium only expenses $30 million of the $40 million of interest owed to bondholders, and its net income equals $55.30 million (earnings before taxes of $70.00 million – taxes of $14.70 million = $55.30 million). However, once we account for the $10 million of interest expense that is not deductible, the stockholders of Millennium will only receive a dividend of $45.30 million ($55.30 million – $10.00 million = $45.30 million). In both cases, the interest paid to bondholders is $40 million. However, when interest is not fully deductible, Millennium Motors’ total annual payments to investors, in particular the payments to stockholders, are lower by the additional $2.10 million the firm pays in taxes. Since the total payments to investors decline, so does the value of the firm.

To determine firm value for Millennium under the deductibility limit, recall from Section 16.2 that the value of a firm with leverage can be calculated as the value of the unleveraged firm plus the present value of the interest tax shield. In the Millennium Motors example in Exhibit C.2, if the cash flows are a perpetuity and the discount rate is 10 percent, the value of the unleveraged firm is $790 million ($79.00 million of annual payments to investors/0.10 = $790 million).

Next, let’s compute the present value of the interest tax shield if the firm takes full advantage of the allowable net business interest expense deduction. Following our discussion in Section C.2, with ATI of $100 million (recall that ATI = EBITDA = EBIT in this example), the maximum interest deduction is calculated as:

where:

Given that the maximum level of deductible interest is lower than the $40 million in total interest to be paid to bondholders, we can compute the face value of the corresponding maximum value of debt with deductible interest given an interest rate (i) to be:

In other words, the company has $800 million in perpetual debt, but the present value of the interest tax shield is limited to the value associated with the maximum allowable net business interest expense deduction (DebtMaximum), which is $600 million. In the Millennium example, the value of the tax shield is $126 million ($600 million × 0.21 = $126 million) and the value of the firm is $916 million ($790 million + $126 million = $916 million). This compares with a value of $958 million when Millennium has $800 million in perpetual debt but there is no limit on interest deductions, as we can see in the last column of Exhibit C.2. Thus, with the limit on the deductibility of interest expense, Millennium’s firm value is $42 million less than when interest is fully deductible. This difference is equal to the value of the lost tax shield on $200 million in debt ($200 million × 0.21 = $42 million).

Note that, in this example, when the value of debt is $600 million or less, there is no difference in the firm value with or without the limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense. This is because with $600 million in debt the interest of $30 million is exactly equal to the $30 million limit on the deductibility of interest. At any debt level above $600 million, interest in excess of $30 million is no longer tax deductible, and there is no additional interest tax shield. If there is no tax advantage of debt beyond $600 million, this is the debt level at which Millennium’s interest tax shield and, all else equal, the firm’s value are maximized. With EBIT of $100 million for any amount of debt above $600 million, the amounts of deductible interest, taxable income, taxes payable, and firm value remain constant at their respective values when debt is equal to $600 million. We can also see that the cost of equity increases as debt increases beyond $600 million. However, this is not due to a tax effect. Rather, as we showed in Chapter 16, and Equation 16.3, this is due to stockholders demanding a higher return when debt increases to compensate for greater risk.

Learning by Doing Application C.3 presents another example of how to calculate the maximum allowable net business interest expense deduction and firm value while considering the interest deductibility limit.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION C.3
Calculating the Maximum Allowable Interest Deduction and Firm Value

Problem

Santan Spirits Company has pretax operating cash flows (ATI) of $3.2 million, no debt in its capital structure, and no depreciation or amortization expenses. Santan is considering adding $18 million in new perpetual bank debt with an interest rate of 9 percent to expand and improve its warehouse and supply chain logistics. If the net business interest expense deduction is limited to 30 percent of ATI and there is a 21 percent flat tax rate, what is the maximum allowable interest expense for Santan, and what is the value of the firm if it issues this amount of new debt? Assume the discount rate for the unleveraged firm is 14 percent.



 

The Net Business Interest Expense Deduction Limit and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
Let’s now look in more detail at the WACC calculations for Millennium Motors when the firm has $800 million in debt and faces a limit on interest deductibility. The WACC formula can be written as Equation 13.7:

With just debt and equity in the capital structure, we use the equation:

To calculate the WACC for Millennium, we first determine the after-tax cost of debt with the limit on net business interest expense deductability using Equation C.1 as follows:

Next, we determine the cost of equity. We saw earlier that when Millennium has $800 million in debt, the value of the firm is $916 million. This tells us that the value of equity is $116 million (Vcs = VFirm − VDebt = $116 million = $916 million – $800 million).

Recall from Chapter 16 and M&M Proposition 2 that the return on common equity can be calculated using Equation 16.5:

If net business interest expense is at or below the deductibility limit, we can use Equation 16.5 to calculate the return on common equity. If the net business interest expense is above the deductibility limit, we can show that the M&M Proposition 2 formula for the return on common equity is:

(C.2)
This looks very similar to Equation 16.5 but has one term for the portion of debt where interest is deductible and another for the portion of debt where interest is not deductible.7 With a 5 percent pretax cost of debt and 10 percent return on assets, we can use Equation C.2 to calculate the return on equity for Millennium Motors as:

Finally, we determine the weights of debt and equity in the capital structure. With a firm value of $916 million, debt of $800 million, and equity of $116 million, the weight of debt is 0.8734 ($800 million/$916 million = 0.8734) and the weight of equity is 0.1266 ($116 million/$916 million = 0.1266).

Given the cost of debt and equity, as well as their respective weights in the capital structure, we can compute the WACC for Millennium Motors as follows:

Learning by Doing Application C.4 presents another example of how to calculate the weighted average cost of capital if there is a limit to the deductibility of net business interest expense when computing pretax earnings.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION C.4
Calculating the WACC

Problem

Eyespy Corporation sells internet-connected security monitoring systems. The firm currently has no debt, a return on equity of 8 percent, and a blended local, state, and federal tax rate of 25 percent. The firm is expected to generate EBIT of $39 million per year in perpetuity and has no depreciation or amortization expenses. Under the 2017 federal tax law, Eyespy’s chief financial officer (CFO) has determined that with $220 million of debt, the firm’s value is $414.38 million. She has asked you to calculate the firm’s weighted average cost of capital at this debt level. Assume that the interest deductibility limit is 30 percent of ATI.





Taxes and Capital Structure Theory
We have shown that lowering the tax rate reduces the value of the interest tax shield but increases cash flows to investors and firm value. When adding the impact of the net business interest deduction limit, we saw that the value of a firm whose interest expense is below the limit did not change as a result of the 2017 federal tax legislation. However, a firm with net business interest expense above the limit incurred a loss of tax shields and a decline in value. We also showed that, holding everything else constant, firm value is maximized when net interest payments just equal the 30 percent of ATI deductibility limit, and that this value does not change for debt levels where net business interest expense exceeds the deductibility limit.

To maximize firm value, managers who apply the trade-off view of capital structure will still adjust the firm’s capital structure to the point where the costs and benefits of adding another dollar of debt are exactly equal. For firms whose net business interest expense is below the interest deductibility limit, adding debt leads to additional tax shields and, depending on the corresponding costs, possibly an increase in firm value. But as we said, firms whose net business interest expense is above the limit already receive the maximum interest tax shield and would not receive an additional tax benefit from increasing the amount of debt in their capital structure.

In contrast, a manager who follows the pecking order view on capital structure will continue to rely on internal funds. With a lower tax rate, the cash flow from operating activity is higher, providing more internal funds for investment. If the firm requires more capital than the additional internal cash flows provide, then as we discuss in Chapter 16, managers will first issue debt and will only sell stock when debt is unavailable or unattractively expensive.

Practical Considerations in Adjusting Capital Structure

In practice, research suggests that firms’ capital structures change following tax changes and that these changes are often less than trade-off models would predict.9 Further, as we note in Section 16.4, there are many other factors that managers raise when talking about capital structure choices, including financial flexibility, risk, and earnings impact. How might changing tax rates and deductibility limits relate to these issues?

Recall that financial flexibility is the ability to take on positive net present value projects, while the term risk in this context refers to managers’ concerns about the volatility of cash flows and earnings. Such volatility can complicate relationships with outside investors who dislike unpredictable earnings or in some cases can put the firm at risk of bankruptcy. For many firms, a lower tax rate would improve financial flexibility, as both cash flows and firm value increase while the proportion of debt in the capital structure decreases. All else equal, these changes would reduce risk, while making it easier to raise new capital, thus increasing financial flexibility. However, for other firms, especially those above the deductibility limit, the opposite is likely true. Firms above the limit will pay more taxes and have lower cash flows, lower firm value, and a greater proportion of debt in the capital structure. All of these changes can detract from financial flexibility and increase risk.

Even though financial theory tells us that managers should only be concerned with cash flows, they often focus on accounting earnings. Under the tax law changes, firms paying lower taxes will experience an increase in the dollar value of net income and in earnings per share. We might expect these firms to stay at their current capital structure. In contrast, for firms paying more taxes, the dollar value of net income and earnings per share will decrease and managers at these companies might reduce debt to offset the decline in earnings numbers.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Describe the major federal tax law changes adopted under H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in 2017 and explain how these changes affect cash flow from operating activity and cash flow to investors.

The adoption of H.R. 1 in December 2017 introduced a number of important changes in corporate tax rates and policies. These changes include eliminating the progressive corporate tax rates used in prior years and replacing them with a single “flat” federal corporate rate of 21 percent. In addition to modifying corporate tax rates, the 2017 federal tax legislation implemented a number of changes for the recognition of pretax expenses. One of the most important changes was the expansion of “bonus depreciation,” which allows for a significant first-year depreciation deduction for qualified assets. Under the 2017 legislation, firms can recognize 100 percent of the depreciation expense for an asset in the first year of its use, doubling the 50 percent bonus depreciation that was in place under prior tax law. Finally, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the legislation places a limit on the dollar amount of net interest that can be deducted from pretax earnings. Under this law, a firm’s deduction for net business interest (interest expense minus interest income) is limited to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income (ATI).

The new corporate tax rate of 21 percent is lower than all but the lowest marginal rate of 15 percent which was applied to the first $50,000 of taxable earnings under the previous tax law. Beyond the first $50,000, firms pay a lower marginal tax rate for each additional dollar of taxable income under the new flat rate. This results in higher cash flow from operating activities (CFOA) and cash flow to investors (CFI). Bonus depreciation has a positive impact on CFOA and CFI for firms investing in long-term assets. With 100 percent depreciation, firms are able to fully recognize the cost of an investment in a fixed asset in the year of the investment and, thus, do not have to defer any of the tax benefits of depreciation to later years. The new limits to the deductibility of net business interest from pretax earnings will increase the taxes paid and lower CFOA and CFI for firms whose interest expense exceeds 30 percent of ATI.

2 Discuss and compute the impact of the 2017 federal tax law changes on the after-tax cost of debt and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a firm.

The 2017 federal tax law changes increased the after-tax cost of debt. The lower 21 percent federal tax rate, all else equal, reduces the value of the interest tax shield. The new tax provision that limits the net business interest expense deduction to 30 percent of the firm’s ATI reduced the value of the interest tax shield and increased the cost of debt capital for firms with net business interest expense that exceeds 30 percent of their ATI. Equation C.1 can be used to calculate the after-tax cost of debt with the new 21 percent rate and limited deductibility of interest.

The reduction in the federal tax rate and the limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense only affect a firm’s overall cost of capital through their impact on the firm’s after-tax cost of debt. The legislation does not have a direct impact on the cost of preferred and common stock.

3 Explain how tax law changes can alter firm value and a firm’s capital structure decisions.

The reduction in the corporate tax rate results in higher after-tax cash flow to investors and, all else equal, increases the present value of the firm. The tax law also imposes limits on the ability to deduct net business interest to 30 percent of ATI. This change reduces the present value of the interest tax shield when a company’s ATI exceeds this threshold. Under the trade-off theory of capital structure, a decline in the present value of the interest tax shield reduces the benefits of debt financing. In contrast, a decline in the tax shield has no effect on the use of debt in the pecking order theory. Under the pecking order theory, managers view internally generated funds or cash on hand as the cheapest source of capital. The relative benefits of debt may decline with the new tax policies, but it is still less expensive than raising money by selling stock.

C.3 Depreciation and cash flow: The CFO of Granger Garden Supplies developed a plan to invest $1.2 million in a new manufacturing facility in 2018. During the planning process, the 2017 federal tax legislation was enacted, increasing the first-year bonus depreciation for facilities like this from 50 percent to 100 percent. The firm has a 23 percent tax rate, has $9.8 million in EBITDA, and had no interest expense in 2018. What is the increase in cash flow from operating activity (CFOA) for Granger in 2018 that is attributable to the additional depreciation expense allowed under the 2017 tax legislation?

Intermediate
C.4 Taxes and the cost of debt: Swift Construction Inc. has 2021 EBIT of $1.6 million, a 23 percent tax rate, a 7 percent rate of interest on its bank loan, and net business interest expense of $650,000. Under the 2017 federal tax legislation, what is the company’s after-tax cost of debt?

C.5 After-tax cost of a bond before the 2017 federal tax legislation:

Perpetual Ltd. has issued 500,000 bonds that never require the principal amount to be repaid to investors. Correspondingly, Perpetual must make interest payments into the infinite future. If the bondholders receive annual payments of $75 and the current price of each of these bonds is $882.35, what would the after-tax cost of this debt be for Perpetual if the 2017 federal tax legislation had not been adopted and the firm was subject to a 40 percent average and marginal tax rate?
After-tax cost of a bond after the 2017 federal tax legislation: The debt issue in part (a) is the only debt that Perpetual Ltd. has outstanding, and the company has no interest income. Assume that the 2017 tax legislation just became effective and reduced Perpetual’s average and marginal tax rate to 21 percent. What is the after-tax cost of this debt if the company has adjusted taxable income (ATI) of $90 million?
C.6 Interest tax shield: JAF, Inc. has $500 million of debt outstanding at an interest rate of 9 percent. Assume that interest payments are fully deductible for tax purposes and that debt is perpetual.

If the marginal tax rate changes from 30 percent to 21 percent, by what amount would the value of the firm’s tax shield decline?
If the tax rate falls from 30 percent to 21 percent, how will JAF’s value change? Explain your answer.
Advanced
C.7 WACC calculation before and after the 2017 federal tax legislation:

It is 2017 (before the 2017 federal tax legislation takes effect) and the Imaginary Products Co. currently has debt with a market value of $300 million outstanding. The debt consists of 9 percent coupon bonds (semiannual coupon payments), which have a maturity of 15 years and are currently priced at $1,440.03 per bond. The firm also has of 2 million preferred shares outstanding with a market price of $12.00 per share. The preferred shares pay an annual dividend of $1.20. Imaginary also has 14 million shares of common stock outstanding with a price of $20.00 per share. The firm is expected to pay a $2.20 common dividend one year from today, and that dividend is expected to increase by 5 percent per year forever. If Imaginary is subject to a 40 percent average and marginal tax rate, what is the firm’s weighted average cost of capital?
Impact on WACC of the reduction in the tax rate due to the 2017 tax legislation: Now, consider that the 2017 federal tax legislation has just passed, reducing the average and marginal tax rate at the Imaginary Products Co. to 25 percent and limiting the net business interest deduction to 30 percent of the adjusted taxable income (ATI). Ignoring the limit of the net interest deduction for the moment, using the financial data for 2017 in part (a), what impact does the reduction in the tax rate alone have on the WACC of the Imaginary Products Co.?
Impact on cost of debt and WACC of the reduction in the tax rate and limit on net business interest deduction due to the 2017 federal tax legislation: If Imaginary’s adjusted taxable income (ATI) equals $40 million, what is the impact of the reduction in the tax rate and limitation on the net business interest deduction to 30 percent of ATI on the cost of debt and the WACC of the Imaginary Products Co.? In these calculations, use the financial data for 2017 that are given in part (a).
C.8 Firm value with limited interest deductibility: You own all of the equity in the Huson Holdings Company. The firm is currently debt free and will generate adjusted taxable income (ATI) of $40 million each year in perpetuity. The return on assets, kAssets, is 10 percent, the tax rate is 21 percent, and the maximum amount of interest that can be deducted for tax purposes is 30 percent of ATI.

What is the value of the all-equity firm?
If Huson Holdings decided to replace $15 million of equity by borrowing $15 million at an interest rate of 8.5 percent, what would the value of the firm be?
Notes
1 With $90,384 in taxable income, the firm’s tax bill under the past tax brackets can be computed as: Tax bill = (0.15 × $50,000) + [0.25 × ($75,000 – $50,000)] + [0.34 × ($90,384 – $75,000)] = $7,500 + $6,250 + $5,230.56 = $18,980.56. Given this total tax bill, the average tax rate paid by the firm is 21 percent ($18,980.56 / $90,384 = 0.21, or 21 percent), which is identical to the flat corporate tax rate introduced in the 2017 tax reform bill.
2 Adjusted taxable income is taxable income not taking into account (1) nonbusiness income, like gains from the sale of assets held for investment, (2) business interest expense or business interest income, (3) net operating loss deductions, (4) a new 20 percent qualified business income deduction, or (5) depreciation, amortization, or depletion. This is essentially pretax operating cash flow, EBITDA, in the current year, as we define it in Chapter 12. From tax year 2022 forward, the definition of ATI will change from EBITDA to EBIT, resulting in a greater limit to the deductibility interest expense.
3 As discussed in the previous section, the firm’s interest tax shield declines from $5.0 million ($20.0 million × 0.25 = $5.0 million) to $3.0 million ($12.0 million × 0.25 = $3.0 million). For simplicity, the tax calculations in this section assume that the limit on net business interest deductions applies to state and local taxes in addition to federal taxes. If it only applies to federal taxes, and the federal tax rate is 21 percent, the firm’s interest tax shield will decline from $5.0 million ($20.0 million × 0.25 = $5.0 million) to $3.32 million [($12.0 million × 0.21) + ($20.0 million × 0.04) = $3.32 million], a decrease of $1.68 million.
4 We are assuming that there is no business interest income, so the annual business interest expense equals annual net business interest expense.
5 As the tax rate changes, the changes in the value of equity and thus the D/E ratio offset the lower tax rate and result in the same cost of equity at each debt level.
6 Firms are permitted to carry forward nondeductible interest and expense it in future years. However, if the interest on debt is continually above the 30 percent threshold, a firm might never be able to use the carry-forward.
7 Note that if debt is at (or below) the maximum, then (VDebt – VDebt_Maximum) is zero or negative, and we would just use Equation 16.5.
8 We can also calculate the cost of equity as the dividends payable to shareholders divided by the value of equity. For example, in the second column of Exhibit C.2, with $800 million debt and the limit on interest deductibility, the dividend payment is $45.30 million and the value of equity is $116 million. The return to equity is thus 39.05 percent ($45.30 million/$116 million × 100 = 39.05 percent).

Math and Skills Review
0.1 Equations
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

1. Use the properties of equations and inequalities to evaluate expressions and solve for desired values.
Solving for a Variable
(Solving for one of the variables in terms of the others in a formula or equation.)

Algebra is full of opportunities to solve for x. You have one answer if you’re working on a linear equation, a possible two answers in quadratic equations, and so on. And sometimes you get to solve for a variable in terms of other variables. For example, if you start with the distance formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate of speed, and t is the amount of time spent going at that rate, then you may want to solve for t. Why? Because you know it’s 300 miles to the lake, and you know that you may go at different rates of speed (depending on who is driving). Solving for t, you get 
 
.

So, if Claire is driving at 50 miles per hour, it’ll take 
 
. But, if Cassie is driving at 60 mph, then it’ll only take 
 
.

Example

Solve for degrees Fahrenheit in the conversion formula
 
. Then use the new version to determine what 37°C is equivalent to on the Fahrenheit scale.

To isolate the F, first multiply each side of the equation by 
 
:

 
 
 
Then add 32 to each side of the equation:

 
So the conversion formula for changing degrees centigrade to Fahrenheit is:

To use this new version, replace the degrees centigrade with a number and get the degrees Fahrenheit. What is 37° equivalent to?

Example

Solve for P in the formula A = P + Prt.

First factor the P from the two terms on the right: A = P(1 + rt).

Next, divide each side by 1 + rt:

So

Example

Solve for R in .

First multiply each side of the equation by the denominator, R − g:

Now distribute the terms on the left: P0(R − g) = D1 becomes P0R − P0g = D1. Next, add P0g to each side of the equation:

You now have P0R = D1 + P0g, so divide each side by P0:

Proportions
(Taking advantage of the properties of proportions to solve for unknowns and determine ratios.)

A proportion is an expression in which two fractions are equal to one another. For example, is a proportion. The two fractions have the same numerical value. One quick check, to assure yourself that you have a proportion, is to cross-multiply. Note that the two cross-products, 4 × 6 and 3 × 8, have the same product. This is one of the properties of proportions. There are other very helpful properties, also.

Properties of Proportions

If , then:

ad = bc
The cross-products are equal.
The “flip” of the proportion is also true.
You can reduce vertically in one fraction, and the proportion remains true.
You can reduce horizontally in the two fractions, and the proportion remains true.
These properties are very useful when working with proportions.

Example

Find the value of x that makes the proportion true.

You could cross-multiply, but that introduces a fairly large number. First reduce the fraction on the left vertically by dividing by 9.

Dividing 27 and 72 by 9:

The numbers are much better, but you can reduce again, horizontally, because both top numbers are divisible by 3.

Dividing 3 and 15 by 3:

Now, cross-multiplying, you have: 1 · x = 8 · 5 or x = 40.

The original proportion, with the x replaced is . To check this, you multiply 27 × 40 = 1080 and you multiply 72 × 15 = 1080.

Example

Solve for R in

At first glance, the equation doesn’t look like a proportion, but if you put the P0 in a fraction, you have one.

The advantage of writing the equation as a proportion is that you can use the properties of proportions to solve for R. One property is that the “flip” of a proportion is always true, so:

Now, to isolate the top of the right fraction, multiply each side of the equation by D1:

Add g to each side, and you have:

Example

If the ratio of lemonade to sweetened iced tea in an Arnold Palmer is 4 ounces of lemonade to 5 ounces of iced tea, then how much lemonade do you have to add to 3 gallons of sweetened iced tea to create this famous mixture?

First, convert the 3 gallons of iced tea to ounces. There are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon. So 3 gallons is 128 × 3 = 384 ounces of iced tea.

Now, write a proportion involving the lemonade and iced tea:

Cross-multiplying and solving for x:

You need to add just a little over 307 ounces of lemonade to the iced tea.

Inequalities
(Using and interpreting the properties of inequalities.)

An inequality is a statement of comparison of two or more entities. You can say that “7 is greater than 4” using the symbols: 7 > 4. If you want to allow for the possibility of equality between two items, you can write “x is less than or equal to 10,000” using the symbols x ≤ 10,000.

When you have a mathematical inequality statement, you can add or subtract the same thing from each side and not change the truth of the statement.

Quick Math Fact

When given a < b or a ≤ b, you can add or subtract the same thing from each side and not change the truth of the statement. It will be true that: a + c < b + c, a − c < b − c, a + c ≤ b + c, and a − c ≤ b − c.

Example

Add 6 to each side of the inequality x − 6 > 4.

This tells you that x represents a number greater than 10. So, if you replace x in the original statement with any number greater than 10, you’ll have a true statement.

Just to demonstrate, here’s what happens if you replace x with 13: 13 − 6 > 4 becomes 7 > 4. True!

Example

Subtract 11 from each side of the inequality 14 ≤ y + 11.

This says that 3 is less than or equal to y or that y is greater than or equal to 3. So any number, 3 or greater, can replace the y, and you have a true statement.

Just to show you how it works, here’s what happens when you let y be 8: 14 ≤ 8 + 11 which is 14 ≤ 19. And what about when y is 3? 14 ≤ 3 + 11 or 14 ≤ 14. They can be equal, also.

Quick Math Fact

When given a < b or a ≤ b, you can multiply or divide each side by the same positive number and not change the truth of the statement. So you can say that if c is positive:

However, if c is negative, then the inequalities get reversed. So, if c is negative:

Example

Divide each side of the inequality 6x ≥ 30 by 6.

Example

Multiply each side of the inequality by −7.

When multiplying by a negative number, you reverse the inequality sign, making it < instead of >.

This says that y has to be smaller than 21 to keep the inequality true. Try replacing the y in the original inequality with 14 to check this.

Yes, −2 is greater than −3 (think in terms of outside temperature).

Example

Jack and Jeff are on a seesaw. Jack weighs 200 pounds and Zack weighs 175 pounds. In order for the seesaw to tilt to Zack’s side, you have to give Jeff a box weighing at least how many pounds?


Think of this as being the inequality: Z + b > J, or Zack’s weight plus the weight of the box is greater than Jack’s weight.

Replacing the Z with 175 and the J with 200, you have: 175 + b > 200.

Subtracting 175 from each side, you get b > 25. So the box has to weigh more than 25 pounds.

0.2 Order of Operations
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

2. Perform simplifications and evaluations of expressions using the correct processes based on the mathematical order of operations.
Adding, Subtracting, Multiplying, Dividing
(Perform computations of complex expressions using the order of operations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.)

The order of operations is a set of rules developed by mathematicians so they could talk to one another. Just like you have to learn another language if you’re going to live in a new country, mathematicians agreed on the language of mathematics, so they could understand what the others meant. With everyone “speaking” the same language, the answers come out the same and the meaning is understood.

What is the order of operations? A favorite mnemonic is PEMDAS: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally (or Pink Elephants Make Darned Acceptable Sweethearts). Whatever you use, this is designed to help you remember the order in which you perform mathematical operations when you’re faced with two or more choices.

PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction

Putting things just a bit differently, think of the order of operations as:

Perform all powers and roots, in order from left to right*
Perform all multiplication and division, in order from left to right*
Perform all addition and subtraction, in order from left to right*
* Any grouping symbols (parentheses, brackets, braces, fraction lines, radicals) take precedence—perform the operations within grouping symbols before applying the result to the general order.

The operations of multiplication and division have equal weight. When moving from left to right, neither takes precedence over the other. The same holds for addition and subtraction and for powers and roots.

Concentrating on the four basic arithmetic operations, here are some examples.

Example

Compute 12 + 3 − 8 ÷ 4 + 11 + 14 × 3

The order of operations dictates that you perform the division and multiplication, first.

Performing the division, you have:

And performing the multiplication:

Now add and subtract, moving from left to right:

Since the rest of the operations are the same, just add 13 + 11 + 42 to get 66.

Just to illustrate how important this rule is, look at what happens if the rules aren’t followed. The following shows the results of performing the operations from left to right in the current order, without using the order of operations.

Example

Compute 80 + 64 ÷ 16 ÷ 8 ÷ 4

The three divisions are performed, first, moving from left to right.

It would be very tempting to do the division from right to left and avoid fractions. But this is why the rules are so important. You want everyone to get the same answer—and not make up their own rules.

Example

Compute 70 − 60 ÷ 10 + 4 × 5

Perform the division, then the multiplication, then subtraction, and, lastly, addition.

Powers
(Perform computations of complex expressions involving powers of single terms and compound expressions.)

The order of operations is a set of rules developed over the centuries so that mathematical and other scientific findings could be read by others in different countries, cities, and places of learning. The order of operations is a mathematical language that is accepted by everyone—we all speak this same language.

What is the order of operations? A favorite mnemonic is PEMDAS: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally (or Picking Easy Methods Decreases Anxiety Significantly). Whatever you use, this is designed to help you remember the order in which you perform mathematical operations when you’re faced with two or more choices.

PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction

Putting things just a bit differently, think of the order of operations as:

Perform all powers and roots, in order from left to right*
Perform all multiplication and division, in order from left to right*
Perform all addition and subtraction, in order from left to right*
* Any grouping symbols (parentheses, brackets, braces, fraction lines, radicals) take precedence—perform the operations within grouping symbols before applying the result to the general order.

The operations of multiplication and division have equal weight. When moving from left to right, neither takes precedence over the other. The same holds for addition and subtraction and for powers and roots.

Concentrating on using powers (exponents), here are some examples.

Example

Compute 72 + 3 × 4 − (6 − 3)3

The order of operations says to perform powers before multiplication or addition. Note that there’s a subtraction problem within parentheses. The order of operations also says that grouping symbols (parentheses are one) come before anything.

Simplify within the parentheses first:

Next, raise the 7 and 3 to their respective powers:

Perform the multiplication before addition or subtraction:

Add 49 to 12, and then subtract 27 from the result:

Example

Compute (−5)2 − 32 + 42 − (−6)2

This problem contains some “tricky” situations. When you square a negative number, the result is positive. Consider squaring −9. This is the same as −9 times −9 which is +81, because there are two negative numbers. The trickiness in this problem has more to do with reading it correctly—using the notation the right way. The steps will point out the pitfalls.

According to the order of operations, you have to perform the four powers (squares) before subtracting or adding.

First, square the −5:

Next, square the 3:

Notice that the −5 was in parentheses. You were squaring a negative number. The 3 is technically a +3; the negative sign indicates subtraction—which is done later.

Now square the 4:

The final power is squaring the −6:

Now the subtraction, addition, and subtraction can be performed from left to right:

Example

Compute (17 − 11)2 + (2 + 3)3

According to the order of operations, you perform the subtraction and addition in the parentheses before performing the powers.

This next example looks somewhat like the first, but there’s a variable in the parentheses, so the two terms can’t be added or subtracted.

Quick Math Fact

When squaring or cubing a binomial (two terms), use the following rule/pattern.

Example

Compute (3 + p)2 + (3 − p)2

Using the rules for squaring binomials:

The two 6p terms are opposites, so they add to 0. Combining the other like-terms:

Quick Math Fact

The area of a circle is found with the formula A = πr2 where r is the radius of the circle the estimate of π is usually either 3.14 or .

Example

Find the area of the circle shown.


The radius of the circle is 5 inches. Putting this value in the formula:

By the order of operations, you square the 5, first:

Now, multiply by 3.14:

Distributing
(Perform simplifications and computations of complex expressions using the distribution property.)

The order of operations is a set of rules developed by mathematicians so they could talk to one another. When mathematicians and other scholars in different countries, different cities, different buildings, and even at different desks perform mathematical operations, you want them all to get the same answer. That’s why the rules were established.

What is the order of operations? A favorite mnemonic is PEMDAS: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally (or Puffy Ears May Deafen Any Sound). Whatever you use, this is designed to help you remember the order in which you perform mathematical operations when you’re faced with two or more choices.

PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction

Putting things just a bit differently, think of the order of operations as:

Perform all powers and roots, in order from left to right*
Perform all multiplication and division, in order from left to right*
Perform all addition and subtraction, in order from left to right*
* Any grouping symbols (parentheses, brackets, braces, fraction lines, radicals) take precedence—perform the operations within grouping symbols before applying the result to the general order.

The operations of multiplication and division have equal weight. When moving from left to right, neither takes precedence over the other. The same holds for addition and subtraction and for powers and roots.

Concentrating on distributing through parentheses, here are some examples.

Example

Simplify 8 (5 + x − z + 3 − 4x)

The order of operations dictates that you simplify the terms within parentheses before performing an operation on them.

The 5 and 3 can be added together, and the 4x can be subtracted from x:

Now the 8 multiplies each term in the parentheses.

So 8 (5 + x − z + 3 − 4x) = 64 − 24x − 8z

Example

Compute 5 + [3 − 9 (4 + 12 ÷ 2)]

You find both brackets and parentheses here. They have the same “power” and are used in the same expression to make it easier to read what is to be done.

Quick Math Fact

When simplifying expressions with multiple grouping symbols, work from the “inside out”. a[b + c(d + e)]: simplify the d + e first.

The parentheses contain addition and division. Using the order of operations, perform the division first:

The brackets contain subtraction and multiplication. Perform the multiplication first:

Now add the two numbers together to get: 5 + [−87] = −82

Example

Simplify the expression used when finding the average rate: r1(a) + r2(b − a) + r3(c − b) if r1 = 0.02, r2 = 0.03, r3 = 0.01.

Replacing the rates in the expression:

Now distribute over the parentheses:

The terms in a and b can be combined:

The order of operations says to do the computations in the parentheses before multiplying by the outside number, but there are times when it just makes more sense (and is easier) if you distribute a number over the terms first. In the following example, you avoid adding fractions if you distribute.

Example

Compute

Multiply each fraction in the parentheses by 6:

Much nicer.

Fraction Lines and Radicals as Grouping Symbols
(Perform computations on expressions involving fractions and/or radicals.)

The order of operations is a set of rules which tell you in which order to perform various mathematical operations. This ordering of steps is necessary so that everyone gets the same answer to the same problem (assuming that they know their addition tables, etc.). The order of operations is used by all mathematicians, scientists, economists, and so on, throughout the world.

What is the order of operations? A favorite mnemonic is PEMDAS: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally (or Pigs Eat More Diet Advantageous Supplements). Whatever you use, this is designed to help you remember the order in which you perform mathematical operations when you’re faced with two or more choices.

PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction

Putting things just a bit differently, think of the order of operations as:

Perform all powers and roots, in order from left to right*
Perform all multiplication and division, in order from left to right*
Perform all addition and subtraction, in order from left to right*
* Any grouping symbols (parentheses, brackets, braces, fraction lines, radicals) take precedence—perform the operations within grouping symbols before applying the result to the general order.

The operations of multiplication and division have equal weight. When moving from left to right, neither takes precedence over the other. The same holds for addition and subtraction and for powers and roots.

Grouping symbols such as parentheses and brackets are easy to spot and suggestive of the rule, but fraction lines and radicals work the same when they’re encountered in a problem.

Example

Compute

According to the order of operations, you perform the operations in the parentheses and in the numerator (top) of the fraction before applying the others.

The parentheses contain a power and subtraction. Find the power first:

The numerator of the fraction contains multiplication and subtraction. You perform the multiplication first:

The power is performed next:

Now the operations to be performed are subtraction, multiplication, and division. Do the multiplication, and then the division:

And, finally the subtraction and addition can be performed in that order, from left to right:

Example

Compute

The radical acts as a grouping symbol, and the computation under the radical has to be performed before multiplying by 10.

Find the powers of 5 and 4 before subtracting:

You find the square root before multiplying:

Almost everyone’s “favorite” formula from algebra is the quadratic formula. You factored quadratics when you could, but the formula came into play when factoring wasn’t possible or was too difficult to perform.

Quick Math Fact

The roots (solutions) of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are found with:

Example

Use the quadratic formula to find the roots of 2x2 − 7x − 15 = 0

First, identify the a, b, and c that will be used in the formula:

Putting these values in the formula:

First, concentrate on the operations under the radical. You square the −7, first:

Next, perform the multiplication of 4 (2)(−15) under the radical:

Now subtract under the radical:

The square root of 169 is 13:

In the numerator, the negative of −7 is 7, and in the denominator, the multiplication needs to be performed:

There are two different operations that need to be performed in the numerator, giving the two different roots of the original equation:

In both cases, the computation in the numerator is done first:

The two answers are x = 5 or .

Logarithmic and Exponential Forms
(Convert between an exponential form and its corresponding logarithmic form using the laws of logarithms and exponents.)

Exponential expressions and logarithmic expressions are related because they’re inverses of one another. The relationship allows you to solve for an unknown value when investigating models involving growth—steady increases in an investment or steady decreases in mass.

Quick Math Fact

If b > 0, then

Example

Write the log expression log101000 = 3 as an exponential expression.

Using logb(y) = x ↔ y = bx, the base of the log, 10, becomes the base in the exponential form, and the 3 is its exponent.

Example

Write the exponential expression 25 = 32 as a logarithmic expression.

Using y = bx ↔ logb(y) = x, the base of the log is 2, and the exponent is what the log is set equal to.

Example

Solve for x in the equation log10(100) = x.

First, change the equation from the logarithmic to the exponential form:

Next, change the 100 to a power of 10:

The exponents on 10 must be the same, so x = 2.

Example

Solve for z in the equation log5(z) = 3.

First, change the equation from the logarithmic to the exponential form:

Now just do the computation: 53 = 125 = z.

Quick Math Fact

The logarithms that are base e use “ln” to indicate loge. These are called the natural logarithms. Base 10 logarithms, log10, are frequently abbreviated “log” and are referred to as common logarithms.

Example

Write the log expression ln 345 = x as an exponential expression.

Using ln(y) = x ↔ y = ex, the base of the log is e, so the e becomes the base of the exponential term. The exponent of the term is x.

Example

Write the log expression ln e−4 = x as an exponential expression.

Using ln(y) = x ↔ y = ex, the base of the log is e, so the e becomes the base of the exponential term.

The exponent of the term is x.

You can now solve for x, which must be equal to −4.

Quick Math Fact

A logarithmic expression can be changed to a more convenient base (a base found in a scientific calculator or table) using the formula:

Example

Change the logarithmic expression log2(32) to a base 10 logarithm.

Using , replace the b with 10, the a with 2, and the x with 32:

You can then use a scientific calculator to get an approximation of the log of 32 and the log of 2:

This shouldn’t be too much of a surprise, since log2(32) = x is equivalent to 2x = 32 = 25.

Most of the time, the numbers don’t turn out quite as nicely, which is why calculators are so important.

Quick Math Fact

If you know that x = y and that they are positive values, then it’s also true that log x = log y and that ln x = ln y. The opposites of each are also true: if log x = log y or ln x = ln y, then x = y.

Example

Solve for x in the equation log (x + 7) = log (16).

Using that if log x = log y, then x = y, you have that x + 7 = 16. Subtracting 7 from each side of the equation, x = 9.

Quick Math Fact

A property of logarithms is that log ax = x log a. The exponent of a becomes a multiplier of the log.

Example

Rewrite the logarithmic expression log3 94 as a product.

Applying log ax = x log a, the 4 is moved in front of the log as a multiplier: log3 94 = 4 log3 9.

Example

Rewrite the logarithmic expression ln 15−2 as a product.

Applying ln ax = x ln a, you move the −2 in front of the ln as a multiplier: ln 15−2 = −2 ln 15.

In the next example, you’ll see why these last two rules are so helpful when dealing with exponential equations.

Example

Solve for x in the equation 10x = 45.

First, rewrite the equation using that if x = y, then log x = log y: 10x = 45 → log 10x = log 45.

Now use the rule log ax = x log a to move the x in front of the log 10: log 10x = log 45 → x log 10 = log 45.

To solve for x, divide each side of the equation by log 10:

Finally, using a scientific calculator: .

0.3 Statistics
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

3. Determine the measures of central tendency and spread of a data set; interpret and analyze the results of the computations.
Central Tendency
(Determine the mean, median, and mode of a data set.)

What does “average” mean? Is it the most expected value? Is it the middle value? Actually, it can be one or both of those things. In statistics, there are three traditional measures of central tendency, and each is used where it best describes what is going on in the set of numbers.

Quick Math Fact

The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers in the set divided by how many numbers there are.

Example

Find the mean of the test scores 56, 89, 78, 93, 77, 81, 81

To find the mean, add up the numbers and divide by 7, the number of scores there are:

The mean is about 79.3 or 79.

As you see, the mean isn’t any of the actual scores. But it describes, on average, what the scores are. Some are below 79.3, and some are above.

Quick Math Fact

The median of a set of numbers is the middle number in an ordered arrangement of the set. If there is no single middle number, then the median is the mean of the two numbers in the middle.

Example

Find the median of the test scores 56, 89, 78, 93, 77, 81, 81

First, put the list of scores in order: 56, 77, 78, 81, 81, 89, 93

Since there are seven numbers in the set, the middle number is the 4th in the list:

The median is 81.

Example

Find the median of the set 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10

There are 14 numbers in the list, so the 7th and 8th numbers are in the middle. The 7th and 8th numbers are both 5, so the median is also 5.

Example

Find the median of the set 100, 200, 200, 200, 300, 400, 600, 600, 600, 600

There are 10 numbers in the list, so the 5th and 6th numbers are in the middle.

The median is the mean of 300 and 400, which is 350.

So the median of the set is 350.

Quick Math Fact

The mode of a set of numbers is the number that occurs most frequently.

Example

Find the mode of the test scores 56, 77, 78, 81, 81, 89, 93

The mode is 81, because that score appears twice, and the rest each appear only once.

Example

Find the mode of the set 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8

There are two modes: 3 and 4, because they both appear four times, more than any of the other numbers.

Weighted Average
(Compute weighted averages given number sets and/or categories.)

A weighted average is a computation of the mean of a data set where some of the values have more influence (weight) than the others.

Example

On Monday, the quiz scores in a class were: 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10. On Tuesday, the quiz scores in the same class were: 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10. What was the total average of all the quizzes?

First, you note that 16 people took the quiz on Monday and only 10 took it on Tuesday. (The flu was going around.)

You can find the average for each day:

You can’t add 8.875 + 7.7 and divide by 2 when finding the mean average, because the two averages have different “weights”.

Since you know that there were a total of 26 quizzes, you can just take the two sums, add them together, and divide by 26:

You may not always have the option of adding the individual sums. Sometimes you’re given the average of one situation and another, the number of items of data, and that’s it.

Example

The average height of the 12 members of team A is 73.2 inches. The average height of the 15 members of team B is 74.4 inches. And the average height of the 9 members of team C is 77.5 inches. What is the average height of all 36 participants?

First, determine what part of the total each team represents:

You can use the fractions or their decimal equivalents. But, since two of the fractions have repeating decimals, a more accurate answer will be found using the fractions.

Multiply each fraction times its corresponding average height:

By using the original fractions, there was only one division necessary, at the end. Using the reduced fractions would have worked just fine, also.

Geometric Mean
(Calculate the geometric mean and compare to the arithmetic mean.)

There are several measures of central tendency. The most commonly used are the arithmetic mean, the median, and the mode. Each has its place in reporting characteristics of data—one giving a better measure than the others.

The geometric mean is used when comparing items that are different from one another. One item may come from a much larger range or have different weight than another. To compute the geometric mean of a set of numbers, you multiply all the numbers and then take a root of the product.

Quick Math Fact

The geometric mean of a set of n numbers is the nth root of the product of the numbers.

Example

Find the geometric mean of the numbers 1, 1, 2, 2, 8

Using the formula: geometric mean

Compare this to the arithmetic mean, median, and mode.

arithmetic mean (add the numbers together and divide by how many numbers)

median (middle number of an ordered list) = 1, 1, 2, 2, 8

The median is 2.

mode (most frequently occurring number) = 1 and 2

There are two modes.

The “averages” all come out around 2. And each has its place, depending on what is being reported.

Example

Find the geometric mean of the percentages 80%, 10%, 50%

Using the formula: geometric mean or 34.2%

Comparing this to the arithmetic mean:

Variance and Standard Deviation
(Compute and interpret the variance and standard deviation of a set of numbers.)

Measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) tell you one thing about a set of numbers. They give you an idea as to the average or most expected number. The measures of variability (range, variance, and standard deviation) tell you about the spread of the set of numbers. Are they all bunched together, or are they spread far out from the center.

The two sets of numbers below each have a mean of 50. Their “spread” is very different.

Quick Math Fact

The range of a set of numbers is the difference between the highest number and lowest number.

Example

Find the ranges of Sets A and B, above.

The range of Set A is 60 − 40 = 20.

The range of Set B is 95 − 5 = 90

Quick Math Fact

The variance of a set of numbers is the mean of the squares of the deviations of each number from the mean. Let the mean of the set of numbers be , and the variance be s2. Then the formula is:

Example

Find the variances of Sets A and B, above.

The mean of set A is 50. So the variance is:

The variance of set A is 50.

The mean of set B is also 50. And the variance is:

The variance of set B is 1450.

When one set of numbers is clustered together more tightly than another, then its variance will be a smaller number.

Quick Math Fact

The standard deviation of a set of numbers is the square root of the variance. Letting s represent the standard deviation:

Example

Find the standard deviations of Sets A and B, above.

Since the variance of set A is 50, then the standard deviation is: .

The variance of set B is 1450, so the standard deviation is: .

Example

Find the mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation of the ages of the first 45 U.S. Presidents when they were first inaugurated. The chart below gives the ages and frequencies.

The mean is the sum of the ages divided by 45:

The median is the middle age in the ordered list, so it’s the 23rd age: 55

There are two modes: 51 and 54 both occur most frequently—five times

The range is the difference between the oldest and youngest: 70 − 42 = 28 years

The variance is:

And the standard deviation is:

Were you wondering who the youngest and oldest Presidents were? The youngest was Theodore Roosevelt, and the oldest was Donald Trump.

Normal Curve
(Interpret statistical values using the curve representation of a data set.)

The normal or bell-shaped curve shows the normal distribution of a data set.

The graph below is a representation of the standard normal curve and illustrates the 68-95-99.7 rule.

The mean of the data set is 0. Between −1 and 1 standard deviation from the mean, you find 68% of the scores or data. From −2 to 2 standard deviations is 95% of the scores, and 99.7% lies between −3 and 3 standard deviations from the mean.


Example

On a recent exam, the mean score was 73, and the standard deviation was 7. The scores were normally distributed. What percent of the students scored below 80 on the exam?

Draw a normal curve showing the scores at the mean and standard deviations of ±1, ±2, ±3.


A score of 80 is 1 standard deviation above the mean. Half of the scores are below the mean, so that’s 50% of the scores. Between 66 and 80, you find 68% of the scores. But the scores from 66 to 80 have already been figured in, so just take half of the 68% or 34%. Adding 50% + 34%, you have that 84% of the students had a score below 80.

Example

A movie theatre has been keeping track of the amount of money spent on concessions. They found that on average, a person spends $6.11 on concessions. The standard deviation is $1.37, and the data is normally distributed. What percent of the customers spend more than $8.85 on concessions?

Draw a normal curve showing the spending at the mean and standard deviations of ±1, ±2, ±3.


$8.85 is 2 standard deviations above the mean. If you add the lower 50% to half of the area between −2 and +2 standard deviations, that’s 50% + 47.5% = 97.5%. But that’s the percentage of people who spend less than $8.85. To find the percentage who spend MORE than $8.85, just subtract 97.5% from 100% to get 2.5%.

Example

A website keeps track of their daily hits and have found that the number of hits is normally distributed. On average, they get 1000 hits per day, with a standard deviation of 240. If bandwidth is measured in terms of the number of hits the site can handle, then how large a bandwidth should the website have to be able to handle 97.5% of the traffic?

Referring to the normal curve, you find 95% of the area between −2 and +2 standard deviations. That leaves 5% divided between the lower end and the upper end. Add half that to the 95%, and you have 97.5% below the +2 standard deviations.

Since the mean is 1000 and 2 × 240 = 480, then 1,480 hits would be the 97.5% amount. They need a bandwidth of at least 1480.

Regression
(Examine an equation for a regression line and determine strength of the relationship.)

A regression line is a model which is used to describe the relationship between input values and output values in a data set. The relationship is shown with a figure (the data points and regression line), with a formula (the equation of a line), and with a value or “rating” of the relationship (correlation coefficient).

Example

Graph the data points in the chart showing the number of hours studied by 15 students and the score they received on the exam for which they were studying. Then draw a line through the points, getting as close as possible to as many as possible.

Hours	0	0	1	1	2	3	3	4	4	5	5	5	6	7	7	9
Score	41	35	40	48	50	60	68	60	65	72	66	75	80	84	90	93
Here’s a graph of the points and a line that’s trying to fit or describe them.


As you can see, the points don’t lie on the line. Some points are above, and some are below. You want to have the best fitting line possible—the one that has the smallest total vertical distance between the line and the points. The line chosen is called the regression line and can be used to predict more scores. Assuming that increasing the number of hours studied will increase the score, you can predict what the score would be if a person studied 10 hours or, because no one studied 8 hours, you could predict what that would produce.

Assume that the regression line above has the formula Score = 40 + 6 × h, where h is the number of hours. Using this formula, then a person studying 8 hours would expect a score of 40 + 6 × 8 = 40 + 48 = 88. This point would lie directly on the line, not above or below. But it’s just a prediction.

Example

Given the graph of the data, below, and the regression line with the equation y = 3.4x + 1, would the point (5, 17) lie above or below or on the regression line?

The best way to check to see where the point would lie is to enter x = 5 into the regression equation. This tells you the point on the line.

If y = 3.4x + 1, then, when x = 5, y = 3.4 (5) + 1 = 17 + 1 = 18. The point on the line is (5, 18), so the data point (5, 17) is below the regression line.


A least squares regression line is the line that makes the vertical distances between the data points and that line as small as possible. Each of the distances is squared when the regression coefficient is computed, because a consistent subtraction direction will make some distances positive and some distances negative—they’d cancel one another out.

Example

Graph the points (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 6), and (5, 2). Then compute the vertical distances between these points and the line with the equation y = 0.6x + 2.


The line with the equation y = 0.6x + 2 lies below some points and above others. The distances from the point vertical to a point on the line are shown. Is this the best line that could be found?

Technology is wonderful in that it allows you to determine the least squares regression line and the correlation coefficient, which is sort of a score for the line. All you have to do is put in the data points, and voila! And, just to help you appreciate it even more, the equation of the best-fit line and its correlation coefficient for the four points in the previous example will be computed, below. You can check it with your calculator.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for the best-fit regression line y = ax + b is found when:

The value of the correlation coefficient, r, is found with:

Example

Given the points (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 6), and (5, 2), find the best-fit regression line and the value of the correlation coefficient.

The formulas are full of sums of this and sums of that. It’s best to just make a quick chart and find those values before beginning.

x
y
x2
y2
xy
2	5	 4	25	10
3	3	 9	 9	 9
4	6	16	36	24
5	2	25	 4	10
Σx = 14	Σy = 16	Σx2 = 54	Σy2 = 74	Σxy = 53
First, to find the value of a, the slope of the regression line:

Now, finding the value of b, the y-intercept:

So the equation of the best-fit line is y = −0.6x + 6.1. This is NOT the line that’s shown. In fact, this best fit line is negatively sloped unlike the positively sloped line in the previous graph.

But how good a fit is this “best fit” line?

Computing the value of r:

So what does this correlation coefficient mean? The value of the correlation coefficient ranges from −1 to 1. The closer the coefficient is to 1 or, when negative the closer to −1, the better the fit. If the coefficient for a particular data set is 1, then every point is on the line. If the score is 0.7, then that’s pretty close and a relatively strong score. A score of 0.5 indicates moderate correlation. Statisticians usually like to see scores greater than 0.5 before considering the correlation to be significant.

The same goes for the negative correlations. A score of −1 means a perfect negative correlation. A score of −0.7 is strong negative, −0.5 is a moderate negative correlation. The closer to 1 or −1, the better the model is at predicting future results.

So, in the above example, the correlation of −0.4243 is not very good. There doesn’t seem to be much correlation between the input and the output. They’re “all over the place”.

Again, it is much better to take advantage of technology. Graphing and financial calculators will do these computations quickly and easily.

0.4 Fractions and Percent
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

1. Recognizing and computing the equivalent values of fractions and decimals and using the results effectively in ratios and proportions.
Fractions and Decimals
(Finding the decimal equivalent of a fraction and the fraction equivalent of a decimal.)

All fractions can be written as decimals. Many decimals can be written as fractions.

All fractions can be written as decimals.

When you are given a fraction, you can rewrite it as a decimal that either terminates (eventually comes to an end) or repeats in some pattern. The numbers in the fraction have to be integers or, at least, rational numbers, but that’s usually what you’re working with, anyway. Here are some fractions and their decimal equivalents.

0.375
0.1464
0.009
0.727272…
4.444444…
0.15666666…
Quick Math Fact

To indicate that a decimal repeats forever, in a particular pattern, either show enough of the pattern and put three decimal points at the end or draw a bar across the repeating digits.

Example

Change the fraction to a decimal.

Divide the bottom (denominator) into the top (numerator). You’ll have to insert a decimal point and add zeros until the division ends or you see a pattern.

 	0	.3	8	8
18	7	.0	0	0
 			 	 
 	1	6	0	 
 				 
 	 	1	6	0
 	 			
 	 	 	1	6
As you see, the 8 will keep repeating forever. This fraction has a repeating decimal.

Example

Change the fraction to a decimal.

Sometimes, it takes a while to find what is repeating in a decimal.

 	0	.2	3	8	0	9	5	2	3
21	5	.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
If you do this problem with your calculator, it gets rounded off, and the pattern isn’t always apparent. But there are six digits that repeat in this fraction. You can write:

Many decimals can be written as fractions.

All decimals that repeat or terminate can be written as fractions. The decimals representing irrational numbers, such as those for: π, e, , and so on are non-repeating. They go on forever, but there’s no pattern to the digits in their representation.

It’s often helpful to change a decimal to a fraction so that it can be used in a computation or worked into a formula. There are two different cases to consider: terminating decimals and repeating decimals. And the repeating decimals are broken into two different cases, also.

Quick Math Fact

To change a terminating decimal to a fraction, put the digits in the decimal over a power of 10 that has the same number of digits as the decimal. Then reduce the fraction.

Example

Find a fraction with the same value as 0.00008

There are five digits in the decimal, so put them over the power of 10 with five zeros. You don’t need to include the 0s in front of the 8.

Quick Math Fact

To change a terminating decimal to a fraction, when all the digits repeat, put the digits in the decimal over as many 9s as there are repeating digits. Then reduce the fraction.

Example

Find a fraction with the same value as 0.123123123…

There are three digits that repeat. Put 123 in the numerator of a fraction with a denominator of 999.

If a decimal number starts out with some digits that aren’t included in the repeating part, then it takes a little more work to find the equivalent fraction. You have to do a subtraction of two multiples of the original decimal, and then solve an equation. It’s easier to just to show the technique to use with the following example.

Example

Find a fraction with the same value as 0.5833333…

As you see, the 3 is repeating forever. But the 0.58 has to be accounted for, also. The goal is to move the 58 to the left of the decimal point.

First, let N = 0.5833333…

Now multiply N by 100 to get: 100N = 58.33333…

Do another multiplication: 1000N = 583.33333….

Now subtract 1000N − 100 N:

Now solve for N by dividing 525 by 900:

Example

How many degrees are in the sector of a pie graph that is used to indicate 75% of a circle?


Quick Math Fact

A pie graph is a circle. A circle measures 360 degrees. A sector is a section of a circle defined by two radii.

To find the number of degrees, you can either multiply 360 by the decimal equivalent of 75% or the fraction equivalent. You will see the fraction used here.

The percentage 75% is equivalent to 0.75 or . This fraction reduces to .

Use the reduced form to multiply 360:

There are 270 degrees in a sector covering 75% of the circle.

Using Ratio and Percent
(Making use of ratio and percent formats to communicate information clearly.)

A ratio is a comparison of two values. It can be written as a fraction, with a colon, or with words. For example, can be written as 3:4 or as “3 to 4”. You can use ratios when comparing like-values.

Example

Consider the pie chart illustrating the distribution of 100 farm animals owned by Old MacDonald.


What is the ratio of pigs to sheep?

The ratio of pigs to sheep is 20 to 25. This is also written 20:25 or . Since the fraction can be reduced, you can also say that the ratio of the pigs to sheep is or the ratio is 4 to 5. This means that for every 4 pigs on the farm there are 5 sheep.

But you can also turn it around and ask for the ratio of sheep to pigs. The number of sheep to pigs is 25 to 20. Look somewhat familiar? Yes, this is also 25:20 and . There are 5 sheep for every 4 pigs.

It’s important, when using ratios, that you specify how—in which order—the values are being compared.

A percent is just a very special fraction. It’s a fraction whose denominator (bottom) is always 100. If you go back to Old MacDonald, you see that 25 out of his 100 animals are sheep. So or 25% are sheep. If you prefer fractions, then you can say that are sheep, but that’s still 25%.

Example

Change the fraction to a percent by finding an equivalent fraction.

First find an equivalent fraction whose denominator is 100. You can do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator (top and bottom) by 2.

The fraction is equal to 70%.

Another way to do this problem is to change the fraction to a decimal.

Quick Math Fact

To change a decimal to a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right. To change a percent to a decimal, move the decimal point two places to the left.

Example

Change the fraction to a percent by finding the decimal equivalent of the fraction.

First change the fraction to a decimal by dividing the denominator (bottom) into the numerator.

 	0.7
50	35.0
To change the number 0.7 to a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right. You’ll need to add a 0 after the 7.

Example

Your total spendable budget after taxes is $147,400. What percent of your budget are you using for entertainment, if your current amount is $22,440?

Before doing any dividing or fraction-changing, reduce the fraction formed by putting the entertainment amount in the numerator and total amount in the denominator of a fraction:

(The reductions were: dividing by 10, 11, and 4, respectively.)

It doesn’t look like there will be any nice way to change the fraction to an equivalent version with a denominator of 100, so divide 51 by 335:

Rounding to the ten-thousandths place and then moving the decimal point two places to the right, gives you:

Is this a lot for entertainment, or not?

Fractions, Decimals and Rounding
(Round numbers specified places.)

All fractions can be written as decimals. Many decimals can be written as fractions. And all decimals can be rounded to a chosen number of digits.

Quick Math Fact

The names of some place values of decimal numbers are shown below.


All decimals can be rounded to a chosen number of digits.

Fractions are exact. Decimals can be exact if they terminate. Repeating decimals often need to be rounded, if you want to use them in a problem or answer.

Rounding numbers means to use an estimate of the exact number. When rounding decimals, you choose how many digits you want to the right of the decimal point and then either drop off the extras (those to the right of the chosen value) or increase the last digit by one. How do you decide whether to just lop them off or round up? The deciding number is 5.

Quick Math Fact

When rounding a decimal, underline the last digit to be used. If the next digit to the right of the underlined digit is four or smaller, then leave the underlined digit alone. If the digit to the right is five or greater, then increase the underlined digit by one.

Example

Round the decimal 0.3333333… to the nearest thousandth.

The thousandth place is the third digit to the right of the decimal point: 0.3333333…

Since the next digit to the right is 3, which is smaller than five, just drop the rest of the digits.

So you can say that: 0.333 ≈ 0.333333…

The rounded version is “approximately” the exact version.

Example

Round the decimal 0.4135728 to the nearest millionth.

First underline the digit in the millionth place: 0.4135728

The digit to the right of the millionth place is 8, which is greater than five. So increase the 2 to 3 and drop the 8.

So 0.413573 ≈ .4135728

Financial institutions don’t round up when figuring out how much interest to pay you. They always round down, which means you “lose” a fraction of a cent, if the interest doesn’t come out even.

Example

How much money do you lose if your interest payment of $140.36983444444… is rounded down instead of up?

Rounding $140.36983444444… to the nearest penny gives you $140.37. Rounding down, instead of using the mathematical rule, gives you $140.36. You don’t really lose a penny, because you didn’t earn that much interest. You lose the difference between $140.36983444444… and $140.36 which is $0.00983444444… This is less than a penny, but they do add up when repeated enough times!

0.5 Interest and Dividend Payments
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

5. Computing amounts of interest and the rates needed to produce desired future values.
Determining Earnings from Interest
(Use appropriate formulas to compute interest on investments.)

The interest on an investment is the amount that the institution pays you for the privilege of holding and using your money. Interest can be paid yearly, monthly, daily, and so on. And interest rates vary greatly.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for simple interest is: I = Prt, where I is the amount of interest paid, P is the principal, or beginning amount, r is the rate of interest as a decimal, and t is the time in years.

Example

Find the amount of interest earned on $10,000 invested at 4% interest for 6 years.

Using the formula: I = 10,000 × 0.04 × 6 = $2,400.

Quick Math Fact

The formula A = P(1 + rt) gives you the total in your account, the original amount plus interest, where A is the total, P is the principal, or beginning amount, r is the rate of interest as a decimal, and t is the time in years.

Example

What is the total amount in an account earning 4.5% interest for 10 years when the original amount deposited was $12,000?

Using the formula: A = 12,000 (1 + 0.045 × 10) = 12,000 (1 + 0.45) = 12,000 (1.45) = $17,400.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for compound interest is: , where A is the total amount in the account, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest as a decimal, m is the number of times each year that the interest is compounded, and t is the time in years.

Example

Find the total amount in an account that started with $10,000 and earned interest of 3% compounded quarterly for 20 years.

Using the formula, you have: .

Using the order of operations, you first divide in the parentheses, then add the result to 1. Next, raise the sum from the parentheses to the 80th power (because you multiply those two numbers in the exponent, first). Finally, you multiply by the number in front.

The amount in the account is $18,180.44 after 20 years.

Compounding can happen yearly, monthly (twelve times per year), quarterly (four times each year), daily (365 times each year), and continuously. That means the interest is compounding an infinite number of times. How can that be? Well, it’s not practically possible, but, as you increase the number of times the interest is compounded, the amount of interest changes less and less. The formula for compounding continuously is just very handy to use. The value of e is a decimal that goes on forever, also, but you can use: 2.71828.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for compounding continuously is: A = Pert, where A is the total amount in the account, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest as a decimal, and t is the time in years.

Example

Find the total amount in an account that started with $10,000 ten years ago and has been earning interest at the rate of 5% compounded continuously.

Using the formula:

The total is $16,487.21.

Effective Interest Rates
(Determining the effects of compounding.)

When you walk into the bank, you see that the interest rate is 3%, but that the effective interest rate is 3.0334%—just a bit higher than the quoted rate of 3%. The effective rate gives you the result of compounding.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for the effective annual interest rate is: , where m is the number of times each year that the interest is compounded.

Example

Determine the effective annual interest rate when the quoted rate is 5.2% and the compounding is done quarterly, monthly, and daily.

Number of Times each Year	Formula	Effective Rate
  4		 5.3023%
 12		 5.3257%
365		5.33718%
As you can see, the number of times doesn’t affect the effective rate all that much. But over time those small differences do add up.

0.6 Probability
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

6. Understand the rules and properties of probability and probability distributions in their applications to life situations.
Probability Distributions
(Create probability distributions to determine the likelihood of particular events.)

A probability distribution is a rule or function that provides the probability of each of the possible occurrences in a situation or experiment. The sum of all the probabilities possible is always equal to 1.

Example

When flipping a coin twice, what is the probability of both results being “heads”?

The probability distribution includes all possibilities and the probability of each.

First, the four possibilities: HH, HT, TH, TT

Number of Heads
 
Probability
2
HH
1
HT, TH
0
TT
Only one of the four different results is that both are heads, so the probability of both heads is or 25%.

Example

A television program wants to feature a family with four children. If such a family is chosen at random from all those that apply, what is the probability that the family will have 3 boys and 1 girl?

First, list all the possibilities. Since, at each birth, there are two possibilities (boy or girl), then there will be 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 = 16 different arrangements possible. They are:

BBBB	BBBG	BBGB	BBGG
BGBB	BGBG	BGGB	BGGG
GBBB	GBBG	GBGB	GBGG
GGBB	GGBG	GGGB	GGGG
Next, a table with the number of boys and the probability of each:

Number of Boys
 	
Probability

BBBB

BBBB, BBBG, BGBB, GBBB
2
BBGG, BGBG, BGGB, GBBG, GBGB, GGBB
1
BGGG, GBGG, GGBG, GGGB
0
GGGG
The probability that the family will have 3 boys and 1 girl is ¼ or 25%.

Example

In May of last year, the probability that the Cardinals would beat the Cubs was 60%. In a three-game series, what is the probability that the Cardinals will win exactly one game, exactly two games, and at least two games?

To determine the probabilities of the Cardinals winning three, two, one or no games, consider the probability tree shown here. The probability 0.6 indicates a win for the Cardinals. Multiplying the probability of the three games together gives the final probability of the three results all occurring.


First, note that all the final probabilities add up to 1: 0.216 + 0.144 + 0.144 + 0.096 + 0.144 + 0.096 + 0.096 + 0.064 = 1.

What is the probability that the Cardinals will win exactly one game?

Look at the fourth, sixth, and seventh entries on the right side of the tree. Add them together:

What is the probability that the Cardinals will win exactly two games?

Look at the second, third, and fifth entries. Adding:

And, finally, what is the probability that the Cardinals will win at least two games?

Winning at least two means winning either two or three, so add the probability of winning exactly two to the probability of winning exactly three:

Counting Techniques
(Use the multiplication principle, permutations, and combinations to count the number of ways to do a task.)

“Let me count the ways.” Elizabeth Barrett Browning probably didn’t intend that any mathematical procedures be used, but her poem does bring up the question, “How do I count them?”

If you were told to count how many whole numbers there are from 1 through 100, you would quickly come up with the answer: 100. Easy. But how many whole numbers are there from 27 through 58? Do you subtract? Then 58 − 27 = 31, which is wrong. If you had subtracted 100 − 1 = 99 to answer the first query, then you would have quickly spotted that you have to add 1 more to include both ends of the list of numbers. So the answer to how many from 27 through 58 is that there are 32 numbers.

See, counting numbers isn’t always that clear-cut or easy. And sometimes it can get complicated, if you don’t want to list all the numbers or items you’re considering. That’s why some nice counting techniques are often used.

Quick Math Fact

The multiplication property of counting says that if you have n1 ways to do choice 1, and n2 ways to do choice 2, and n3 ways to do choice 3, and n4 ways to do choice 4, and so on and so on… then, to do one of each:

Example

You can build your own pizza by choosing one meat, one vegetable, one type of cheese, one sauce, and one type of crust. There are 3 meat choices (sausage, pepperoni, ham), 4 vegetable choices (onion, green pepper, yellow pepper, hot pepper), 3 cheese choices (mozzarella, Swiss, colby), 4 sauces (mild tomato, spicy tomato, very spicy tomato, Alfredo), and 2 crust choices (thin, regular). How many different pizzas can be built?

You could start listing the pizza possibilities: (1) sausage, onion, mozzarella, mild tomato, thin crust; (2) sausage, green pepper, Swiss, mild tomato, regular crust; (3)… You get the picture.

If you just need to know how many different pizzas are possible, use the multiplication property:

Doesn’t make much sense to create a sample of each type for display.

Example

You plan to visit all 50 states during the next few years. You want to make a list of the states in the order that you’ll be visiting them. How many different orders are there for visiting the 50 states?

Using the multiplication property, you identify how many ways you can visit the first state, then how many ways to visit the second state, etc.

There are 50 ways to visit the first. Then, with the first state eliminated, there are 49 to visit the second. You have 48 choices for the third state, etc.

So, using the multiplication property, the number of possible choices would look like:

Oops. Too big to give the exact answer. There would be over 3 × 1064 ways (that’s a 3 followed by 64 zeros).

Now consider a possible situation when playing a word game. You have five letters remaining and want to play three of them in a quadruple-score zone. The letters you have are: A E H M S. How many three-letter words are possible? You see HAM, SHE, ASH, EMS, but have you missed any? There’s a formula that can help you determine how many “words” there are (how many, but not what they are).

Quick Math Fact

The number of permutations of n different items taken k at a time is found with:

In case you need a reminder, n! = n(n − 1)(n − 2)(n − 3) ⋯ 3 · 2 · 1

If you are determining the number of permutations of n objects, when you are taking some or all of them at a time, you care about the order. “Order matters.”

Example

How many different permutations are there of the five letters A E H M S when you choose three of them at a time?

Using the formula for permutations:

Now that you know how many, you can be sure if you’ve tried all the possibilities.

Just for fun, here are the 60 possibilities:

AEH	AEM	AES	AHM	AHS	AMS	EHM	EHS	EMS	HMS
AHE	AME	ASE	AMH	ASH	ASM	EMH	ESH	ESM	HSM
EAH	EAM	EAS	HAM	HAS	MAS	HEM	HES	MES	MHS
EHA	EMA	ESA	HMA	HSA	MSA	HME	HSE	MSE	MSH
HAE	MAE	SAE	MAH	SAH	SAM	MEH	SEH	SEM	SHM
HEA	MEA	SEA	MHA	SHA	SMA	MHE	SHE	SME	SMH
As you see, there aren’t too many actual “words” to choose from for the next play. Just arranging the letters doesn’t necessarily produce a real word.

Example

A raffle is being held where the three prizes are: a car, a television, and a fancy dinner. If 1000 tickets were sold, and the tickets will be drawn by machine with the first ticket winning the car, the second the television, and the third the dinner, then how many different ways can 3 of the 1000 tickets be drawn?

Using the formula for permutations:

That’s almost a billion different ways that the three prizes can be awarded to 3 out of the 1000 contestants.

In the last three examples, you see that the order matters. If you’re one of the three prize winners, you want to be the one who gets the car—not the dinner. But many times you need to count how many ways to do something where the order doesn’t really matter. When that’s the situation, you need the formula for the number of combinations.

Quick Math Fact

The number of combinations of n different items taken k at a time is found with:

This formula looks very much like the one for permutations with the difference that there’s another factor in the denominator. This extra factor makes the resulting answer smaller. If the order doesn’t matter, then you don’t have to worry about how many ways to arrange the choices.

Example

There are twenty people in your club, and you need a committee of three to make plans for a party. How many different ways can three people be selected?

Using the formula for combinations:

So there are 1,140 different committees that can be selected.

Example

You have money to invest in stocks. Your broker suggests picking any 4 of the 7 choices she has made, and invest an equal amount in each. How many ways can you choose the 4 stocks?

Since the order of the choices doesn’t matter, use the formula for combinations:

So there are 35 different ways to choose the 4 stocks.

Basic Probability Rules
(Apply rules of probability to determine the chance of a situation occurring.)

What is the probability that it will rain tomorrow? Thank goodness we aren’t going to deal with that type of problem! We’ll stick to things that are still “chancy” but with more to base our predictions on for an answer.

The probability of something occurring is the likelihood or chance that it will occur—in terms of a number. The probability of an event always ranges between 0% and 100% (from impossible to for-sure). The most general formula for finding the probability of an event involves dividing one number by another number.

Quick Math Fact

The probability of an event, P(E), occurring is found with:

Example

If there are 20 M & M’s in a jar, 6 yellow, 7 red, and 7 blue, then what is the probability that you grab a yellow M & M if you reach in with your eyes closed and choose one?

There are 6 yellow M & M’s in the “desired” category. And there are a total of 20 candies. Using the formula:

There’s only a 30% chance that you’ll snag a yellow candy.

Example

You shuffle a standard deck of cards and then take the top card, without peeking to see what it is. What is the probability that the card you chose is an ace?

There are 4 aces in a standard deck of 52 cards. Using the formula:

Example

You are one of 40 astronauts training to go to Mars. Since all are equally qualified, the 5 astronauts who will go on the first flight will have their names drawn from a helmet. The first name drawn will get to be captain, and the other four will have equal flight-supervisory roles. What is the probability that you will get to go—in any position? And what is the probability that you will get to go as captain?

First, to determine the probability that you’ll be included in the flight, figure out how many different groups of five can be selected from the 40 astronauts. Order doesn’t matter. Using the formula for the number of combinations of 5 that can be selected from 40:

So there are 658,008 different groups of 5 that can be selected.

How many of those groups will include you? To determine this, figure that your name is drawn and then four more—again, order doesn’t matter. So find the number of combinations of 4 more astronauts can be chosen from the remaining 39:

There are 82,251 groups of five that include you!

The probability that you’ll be in the group of five that gets to go:

Wow!

To figure the chance that you’ll be captain is much easier. The captain is the first name drawn. So you have one chance out of 40:

Of course, if you want to figure the chance that you’re captain if you already know you’re going (this is conditional probability), then that’s 1 in 5 or .

Conditional probability is a situation where the numbers change based on additional information or on some previous activity. It’s the probability of an event if another event has occurred.

Example

There are 16 marbles in a bag. 9 are blue and 7 are red. What is the probability of reaching in and drawing two red marbles?

Consider the two drawings as two different events. You want to draw a red marble AND you want to draw another red marble.

The first draw: there are 7 red marbles in the bag of 16:

The second draw: there are 6 red marbles left in the bag of 15:

You want to perform the first AND the second, so you multiply the probabilities together:

Example

You have two buckets. The first bucket has two red golf balls and three white golf balls. The second bucket has three red golf balls and seven white golf balls. You flip a coin to choose a bucket at random and, with eyes closed, pick out a golf ball. What is the probability that you select a red golf ball?

Before doing the math, take a look at a tree diagram that illustrates the possibilities.


You see that:

If you pick the first bucket, you have a 40% chance of choosing a red golf ball. You multiply the probability of choosing that bucket with the probability of drawing a red ball, and your chance is 20%.
If you pick the second bucket, you have a 30% chance of choosing a red golf ball. You multiply the probability of choosing that bucket with the probability of drawing a red ball, and your chance is 15%.
So, adding the two values together, you have a 35% chance of drawing a red golf ball. You can’t just add the number of balls together. A total of 5 out of the 15 golf balls is red—which is . But this doesn’t factor in the different number of choices in each bucket.

Venn Diagrams
(Construct and interpret a Venn diagram to illustrate and solve a probability problem.)

A Venn diagram is a sketch that shows all the possible relationships between a collection of items from different sets. It illustrates the items shared by more than one of the sets and acts as a useful organizational and counting tool.

Example

A group of 30 people is polled about television shows. If 13 people like Dancing with the Stars, 15 people like Big Bang Theory, and 12 people like both of those shows, then what percent of those polled don’t like either of them?

Draw a Venn Diagram with two circles: one for those who like Dancing and one for those who like Theory. Have the circles overlap for those who like both.


The circle on the left has to contain a total of 13, and the circle on the right has to contain a total of 15. Their intersection has to contain 12. So that leaves 13 − 12 = 1 for the left part of the left circle and it leaves 15 − 12 = 3 for the right part of the right circle.


You see a total of 16 people accounted for. Since 30 people were polled, then 30 − 16 = 14 of them don’t like either show.


So or over 46% of those polled don’t like either program.

Example

Ted has 60 active clients who he is inviting in for consultations. 39 of them own stocks, 44 own bonds, and 44 of them are in the money market. Of those, 28 own both stocks and bonds, 33 own bonds and are in the money market, and 14 own stocks and are in the money market. Also, 24 are in all three. What percentage of his clients own stocks only?

Draw a Venn diagram with three circles. Have them all overlap.


Put the number 24 in the middle circle to represent those who are in all three.


Since 28 own both stocks and bonds, then subtract 24 of them to get 28 − 24 = 4 who own just stocks and bonds but no money market.

Since 33 own both bonds and are in the money market, then subtract 24 of them to get 33 − 24 = 9 who own just bonds and are in the money market but don’t have stocks.

Since 32 own both stocks and are in the money market, then subtract 24 of them to get 32 − 24 = 8 who own just stocks and are in the money market but don’t have bonds.


A total of 39 own stocks, so 39 − (4 + 8 + 24) = 3 who own stocks only.

A total of 44 own bonds, so 44 − (4 + 9 + 24) = 7 who own bonds only.

A total of 44 are in the money market, so 44 − (8 + 9 + 24) = 3 who are in the money market only.


All the numbers in the Venn diagram so far add up to 58. So that means 2 clients are not in any of these.


Three of the clients own stocks only, so that’s .

0.7 Graphs
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

7. Create various types of graphs of functions and data, and interpret the significance of various characteristics displayed by the graphs.
Histograms and Bar Graphs
(Construct histograms and bar graphs to represent data and interpret the resulting figure.)

A histogram is a type of bar graph. A histogram is an estimate of a probability distribution, representing all of the data proportionately. The widths and heights of a histogram represent areas that total 100% of a distribution.

A bar graph consists of vertical or horizontal bars that shows comparisons of categories they represent.

Example

You buy a bag of M&M’s and count the number of each color candy in the bag (before eating it). Use the bar graph to determine how many M&M’s were in the bag, and what percentage of them were red.


The total number of M&M’s is 30 + 15 + 40 + 20 + 35 + 25 = 165.

To find the percentage that are red, divide 30 by 165:

Notice other things you can quickly identify from the bar graph: the green M&M’s are the most frequent, and the blue ones are the least.

Example

Make a bar graph of the following results of a poll involving a favorite movie.

Gone with the Wind:	14
Jaws:	11
Star Wars:	23
Pink Panther:	9
A bar graph with horizontal bars works well with this topic.


Example

Consider the bar graph below. The profits in 2005 are lower than the other years, and what else can be determined from the graph about 2005?


In 2005, the total revenues are lower than the past years, and the expenses are higher—close to the amount of revenue.

Example

Create a histogram of the number of letters in the names of the States in the U.S. The number of letters: 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13

Create bars with length corresponding to the frequency of each number of letters: 3 units for 4 letters, 3 units for 5 letters, 5 units for 6 letters, etc.


Pie Charts
(Interpret pie charts illustrating the division of assets and construct a usable pie chart from data.)

A pie chart is named so because that’s exactly what you see: a round pie-shaped figure with various “slices” indicated. Unlike an apple pie, where you try to cut the slices evenly to be fair to everyone, a pie chart is more often divided unequally to illustrate how a particular quantity is separated into different categories.

Example

What percentage of the expenses is spent on travel?


First, find the total: $33,330 + $16,670 + $12,500 + $12,500 + $25,000 = $100,000

To find the percentage spent on travel, divide $25,000 by the total, $100,000.

The decimal 0.25 is equal to 25%.

Example

Create a pie chart to illustrate the break-down of schooling for people 25 years old and over.

No high school degree − 17%
High school only − 32%
Some college − 28%
4 or more years of college − 23%
A pie chart is a circle, and a circle measures 360 degrees. Determine the number of degrees for each section:

No high school degree	17% → 0.17 × 360 = 61.2
High school only	32% → 0.32 × 360 = 115.2
Some college	28% → 0.28 × 360 = 100.8
4 or more years of college	23% → 0.23 × 360 = 82.8
Create a pie chart with the number of degrees assigned to each section.


Box-and-Whisker Plots
(Interpret and construct a box-and-whisker plot to represent a data set.)

A box-and-whisker plot is called that because you may think that you see the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland as you observe the graph.


When a box-and-whisker plot is displayed on a number line, you interpret the positions as follows:


The lowest value and highest value are the two extremes in the data in an ordered list. The lower quartile, Q1, is the median (middle) of the numbers to the left of the overall median. And the upper quartile, Q3, is the median of the numbers to the right of the overall median.

Example

Find the minimum, maximum, lower and upper quartiles, and median of the test scores, using the box-and-whisker plot.


The minimum or lowest score is 60, and the maximum or highest score is 96. The median score is 83. The lower quartile is 68, and the upper quartile is 92.

Example

Create a box-and-whisker plot using the given data.

The median (middle) score is 9, the lower quartile (middle of the numbers to the left of 9) is 8, and the upper quartile (middle of the numbers to the right of 9) is 11.

Putting these in a box-and-whisker plot:


Stem and Leaf
(Reading, interpreting, and creating stemplots to illustrate sets of data.)

A stemplot is an organized illustration of a set of data in which all but the last digit of each number in the set is listed, in numerical order, on the left side of a vertical line and all the final digits of numbers with those left-side beginnings are on the right side of the vertical line. An example will help make this more clear.

Example

Twenty students take an exam, and their scores are shown in the stemplot below. Make a list of the scores.

10	0
9	1 1 4
8	0 1 5 6 8 8
7	6 6 7 7 7 9
6	3 8
5	
4	3 7
The scores range from 100 down to 43. You read the digit(s) to the left of the line and then, one-at-a-time, pair them with the digits on the right. The scores are: 100, 91, 91, 94, 80, 81, 85, 86, 88, 88, 76, 76, 77, 77, 77, 79, 63, 68, 43, 47.

This type plot helps to organize the scores and also give you a good feel for the average and the range of scores.

Example

Make a stemplot of the 36 IQ test scores: 90, 125, 100, 116, 93, 106, 95, 112, 104, 101, 81, 116, 95, 110, 93, 127, 105, 105, 110, 113, 96, 99, 78, 124, 111, 105, 101, 118, 93, 105, 90, 103, 97, 86, 75, 102. What is the most frequently occurring score? Which is the middle score? What is the range of scores?

The most frequently occurring score is 105. The middle score is also 105. With 36 scores, the “middle” lies between the 18th and 19th scores, but both of those are 105, so that qualifies as the “middle”. The range of scores is the difference between 127 and 75 which is 52.

Area Under a Curve
(Determine the area between a curve and the horizontal axis and interpret its meaning.)

Area is a two-dimensional measure. You think of how many squares you can fit in an object and then give the measure of that object in terms of its area. The following are some area formulas that should be helpful.

Quick math facts:


Example

Find the area of the shaded region.


There are two ways to approach finding the area.

You can find the area of the rectangle to the left and the area of the triangle to the right and add the two together.

You can find the area of the trapezoid.

Example

Determine the total amount of revenue earned by selling the number of items at the prices indicated.


The different areas show:

The normal or bell-shaped curve shows the normal distribution of a data set. The total area under the curve is 1 square unit, representing all of the data.

The graph below is a representation of the normal curve and illustrates the 68-95-99.7 rule.


Example

Using the normal curve and its percentages, find the area under the curve between x = −1 and x = 1.

The area between x = −1 and x = 1 is 68%.

Example

Using the normal curve and its percentages, find the area under the curve between x = −2 and x = 0.

The area between x = −2 and x = 0 is half the area between x = −2 and x = 2, so it’s 47.5%.

Example

Using the normal curve and its percentages, find the area under the curve between x = 1 and x = 2.

If you subtract the area between −1 to 1 from the area between −2 and 2, you get 95 − 68 = 27%. Half of 27% is 13.5%.

Example

Using the normal curve and its percentages, find the combined areas under the curve that are greater than 3 and less than −3.

Subtract the area between −3 and 3, 99.7% from 100% and you get 0.03%.

Slope
(Computing and interpreting the slope of a line or slope at a point.)

When graphing lines on the coordinate plane, one of the characteristics of the line is its slope. The word slope is pretty descriptive, especially when you think of the ski slope and the difference between the “bunny slope” and the more serious slalom run. The bunny slope would have a smaller numerical designation than the slalom, in terms of steepness.

In mathematics, slope is also referred to as “rise over run” and “rate of change”.

Quick Math Fact

To compute the value of the slope of a line when you have the coordinates of two points on the line, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), use the formula .

Example

Find the slope of the line that contains the points (4, −3) and (0, 6).

Using the slope formula, insert the coordinates: .

The coordinates of the points can be reversed, but be sure that the coordinates of a point are always above and below one another and that the y-coordinates are on the top.

Here’s the computation with the coordinates reversed:

Example

Sketch the graph of the line y = −3x + 5 and determine its slope using “rise over run”.

Two points that can be used to sketch the graph of the line are (0, 5) and (3, −4). (There are many more choices, and all of them will give you the same line.)

The sketch of the line:


Now draw a horizontal line through (0, 5) and a vertical line through (3, −4).


Measure the lengths of the segments from the point of intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines to the named points.


Using “rise over run”, the slope formula now reads: .

First determine the “run”. Start with the left-most point, (0, 5), and move to the intersection. The “run” is 3 units.

Then, continuing from the point of intersection, move to the second point. The “rise” in this case is really a “fall”. The second point is 9 units down from the first, so the “rise/fall” is −9.

The slope of the line is −3.

You may have already determined this from the equation of the line. The line y = −3x + 5 is in slope-intercept form.

Quick Math Fact

A line in the slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, has a slope of m and a y-intercept of b.

Example

Find the rate of change of quantity to days from the 60th to the 80th day of production.


First, determine the approximate coordinates of the points when the number of days is 60 and 80. Indicate the points on the graph.


The curve between the two points isn’t a straight line, but it’s close enough to use the slope formula. Finding the rate of change of price to days:

The price increased approximately $2.25 per day between the 60th and 80th days.

There are two slopes that can be considered “special”. Those two are the slopes of horizontal and vertical lines.

First, consider the horizontal line going through the y-axis at (0, 2) and the point (4, 2). Computing its slope:


Quick Math Fact

The slope of any horizontal line is 0.

Next, computing the slope of the vertical line through the x-axis at (3, 0) and the point (3, 4):

You can’t divide by 0. This is “undefined”.

Quick Math Fact

The slope of any vertical line is undefined.

Intersection of Lines and Curves
(Determine coordinates of intersecting lines and curves and interpret their importance.)

The graphs of functions and other curves are usually found on a coordinate plane—a two-dimensional surface with perpendicular axes indicating the scales. Look at the examples of coordinate planes, below.


When graphing information, you often have two different lines or curves on the same graph. And an important thing to find in the graph of two different curves is the intersection, or where the curves cross. If you have equations or formulas for the curves, then you can use algebraic techniques to try to solve for their common points. If no equations are given, then you can estimate using the coordinates given on the axes.

Example

Find the point of intersection of the line y = 3x + 2 and the line y = 8 − 3x.

One approach to use is to graph the two lines.

The first line, y = 3x + 2 has a y-intercept of (0, 2). You find this by letting the x = 0 and solving for y: y = 3 (0) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2. Another point on the line is (2, 8). Again, let x = 2 and solve for y. Placing the two points in a graph and drawing a line through them, you get the following:


The second line, y = 8 − 3x contains the two points (0, 8) and (2, 2). Place the two points on the graph and draw the line through them.


Now you use the graph to determine the point of intersection.


The intersection appears to be at the point (1, 5).

A second approach to solving this problem is to set the two equations equal to one another. Since the equations are each in the form y = , you can equate what they’re equal to: 3x + 2 = 8 − 3x.

Solving for x, you add 3x to each side: 3x + 3x + 2 = 8 − 3x + 3x which is equivalent to 6x + 2 = 8.

Now subtract 2 from each side: 6x + 2 − 2 = 8 − 2 which is equivalent to 6x = 6.

Dividing each side by 6, you get x = 1.

Substitute 1 in for x in the first equation, and you have y = 3 (1) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

The point of intersection is when x = 1 and y = 5 or (1, 5).

Example

Approximate the points of intersection of the two curves.


You don’t have the equations, so you estimate from the graph.


The intersections appear to be at approximately (4.9, 6.5) and (16.7, 0.6).

Example

Find the points where the profit amounts change from negative to positive and then from positive to negative.


Just looking at the graph, you can see that the profit curve crossed the x-axis to the right of the y-axis and then dips below the x-axis again to the right of the 500-mark. It would be very difficult to make a reasonable guess as to the exact values, so the profit equation is given here: P(x) = −0.15 (x2 − 700x + 60,000), where P is the profit in dollars and x is the number of units produced.

To find where the curve changes from positive to negative or negative to positive, you determine where the profit is equal to 0: the dividing point between positive and negative. Set P(x) = 0 and you have 0 = −0.15 (x2 − 700x + 60,000). The quadratic in the parentheses factors, so the equation is now 0 = −0.15 (x − 100)(x − 600). This equation is equal to 0 when x = 100 and when x = 600. So the two places of sign change are at (100, 0) and (600, 0).

Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium Point
(Construct a graph involving supply and demand; then interpret the results.)

Supply and demand is a well-known economic model used in price determination in a competitive market. The intersection of the supply and demand curves or functions is known as the equilibrium point or where you have market equilibrium. The prices of the items being sold are placed on the vertical axis, and the number or quantity of the items is shown on the horizontal axis.

Example

What is the equilibrium point in the supply/demand graph below?


The company producing the product will supply 0 units if the price is only $7 and will be happy to produce 2500 units if the price is $32 per unit. But it’s predicted that consumers would only buy 300 units if the price is $32. The equilibrium price is found at the intersection of the two lines: (14, 21). If the price is $21, then the supplier will produce 1,400 units and the consumers will buy all those units—nothing left over and no one left unserved.

Example

Two different companies, A and B, are competing for a contract to be the supplier of a particular product. Which equilibrium point is most beneficial to the consumer company?

Supplier A will produce 15,000 units if the price is $13 per unit. Supplier B will produce 14,000 units if the price is $14 per unit. If the number of units isn’t critical, then Supplier A “wins” with a total cost of $195,000 compared to Supplier B’s total cost of $196,000 for fewer units.


Piecewise Functions
(Interpret information from graphs and function rules of piecewise functions.)

A piecewise function is a rule that changes depending on the input values. You use one version for smaller input values and another for larger input values and maybe even a third, fourth, and fifth rule, and so on. One of the best examples of a piecewise function is what you pay for cell phone usage.

Consider the company that offers you the following:

For 0 − 1000 minutes, you pay 0.016 cents per minute
For more than 1000 minutes, you pay $16 plus 0.0012 cents per minute for every minute more than 1000.
The graph of this plan is shown below.


A possible formula for this function is:

where m is the number of minutes.

As you see, a piecewise function is not usually smooth. It can make abrupt jumps and turns.

Example

Use the 2017 Federal Income Tax rates for a single person to construct a graph illustrating the function. The function T(d) gives the amount of tax owed if the taxable income is d dollars.

Using the function and finding the corresponding values, you see that the steepness changes, corresponding to the increased percentages. What is also illustrated is the interesting phenomenon between $200,000 income and $450,000. There’s a long interval for one rule and then a very short one for the next. Wonder why?


Example

Write a rule for the piecewise function shown below.


The first part of the function goes from the point (0, 9) to the point (3, 6). This is a piece of the line that has a y-intercept of 9 and a slope of −1. The slope is determined by observing the “run” of 3 units and the “rise/drop” of 3 units. The equation of such a line, in slope-intercept form, is y = −1x + 9 or y = −x + 9.

The middle part of the function is a piece of the horizontal line y = 6.

And the right-most part of the function is a piece of a line that has a slope of . You can determine this by observing that for a “run” of 3 units, the segment has a “rise” of 1 unit. To find the y-intercept, just do some back-tracking. From the point (8, 6), move 2 units back and 1 unit down to the point (6, 5). Move another 2 units back and 1 unit down to get to (4, 3). Then repeat twice more and you end up at (0, 2), the y-intercept. With the three lines identified, the rule can be written:

You notice that either the first or second rule can be used when x = 3 and that either the second or third rule can be used when x = 8. This occurs when one part of the graph picks up where the last one left off. This isn’t always the case. There can be gaps in the graph—and in the function values.

Logistics Function
(Become familiar with the logistics curve and interpret the characteristics shown.)

A logistics function has a graph that is a gentle curve, moving upward or downward, with a change in concavity somewhere in the middle. Here are two general examples of logistics curves.


These curves may not seem very exciting to you, but they are very important in terms of describing growth in populations, medical situations, sales, etc.

The three quickest things to learn from the graph of a logistics curve are its maximum value, minimum value, and turning point (where progress or change slows down). Look at the two graphs again.


There’s an “urban legend” going around that Sam Walton (of Wal-Mart fame) made his money by determining when a new product started being bought by consumers at a decreasing rate. He had the inventory of that product reported every night so he could determine when the slow-down began. Then he would cut back on the purchasing of that product and, consequently, not have a surplus of inventory that would have to be sold at a reduced price. The logistics curve is a representation of how this can be tracked.

Quick Math Fact

A general form for the equation of a logistics curve is where L is the maximum value (limiting factor), e is the Euler number (about 2.71828), and k affects the steepness (like slope). The turning point is found when .

Example

If the logistics function can be used to predict the world population in billions of people in x years since 1900, then what is the maximum number of people that the earth can hold?

The numerator of the fraction gives the maximum value, so this model says that the earth can hold a maximum of 11.5 billion people.

Example

If the logistics function can be used to predict the world population in billions of people in x years since 1900, then did the growth slow down?

To do this, you need access to a graphing, scientific, or financial calculator. The turning point is found when , so you replace the A with 12.8 and the k with 0.0266 and you get that x = 95.84. So in about 1996, the population of the world was still growing, but the rate at which it was growing started decreasing.

Example

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has a logistics function, , where GDP is in billions and t is the number of years since 1970. According to this model, what will the GDP be in 2020?

To do this calculation, you need access to a graphing, scientific, or financial calculator. Replacing the t in the function with 50 (2020 is 50 years since 1970) you get:

The GDP is expected to be about 5,323 billion or 5.323 trillion dollars.

0.8 Infinite Series
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

8. Use the general term of a sequence and the rule for the sum of the series created to write out terms and find the sum of the desired number of terms.
Sigma Notation
(Interpret summation notation and do computations given the notation for a series.)

Sigma notation, or the summation symbol, is very handy and descriptive when dealing with sums of the terms in a sequence. The capital letter for sigma, Σ, is used to indicate this summation, and other symbols and expressions tell the rest.

Interpreting the notation you read it: “Find the sum of all the terms of form from n = 1 through n = 100.” Putting in the values for n, you would have something like: . The dots (ellipses) in the middle show a continued pattern. Writing all 100 numbers isn’t necessary.

Example

Compute

This says to add:

Example

Compute

This says to add:

No, I didn’t write out all 100 numbers and add them. Since this is an arithmetic series, where each term is 5 greater than the previous term, I just used the formula.

Quick Math Fact

The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be found with: , where a1 is the first term, an is the last term, and n is the number of terms.

Using the formula and inserting 100 for n, 1 for a1 and 496 for a100, the sum is:

Example

Compute

Write the four terms in a sum, replacing n with the number of the term in each case.

Yes, a calculator is a big help in this case.

Partial Listing of Terms
(Listing the terms in a sequence from a rule or description and creating a rule from a list of terms.)

An infinite series is the sum of all the terms in a sequence. A sequence is a list of terms that can be created from some rule or formula—the terms all have something in common and any term can be created from the rule and its number. Some examples of how to define a sequence are: an = n + 1, an = 3n, , and so on. The possibilities are endless.

In each case, you find the terms of the sequence by substituting 1, 2, 3, … for n in the rule.

Example

Find the sum of the first six terms of the sequence an = 3n + 1.

Number of term: n
Term value: 3n + 1
1
3 (1) + 1 = 4 
2
3 (2) + 1 = 7 
3
3 (3) + 1 = 10
4
3 (4) + 1 = 13
5
3 (5) + 1 = 16
6
3 (6) + 1 = 19
The first six terms are: 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19. Did you notice that the difference between consecutive terms is always 3? This happens in arithmetic sequences.

Quick Math Fact

An arithmetic sequence has terms that increase or decrease by a common value. Each set of consecutive terms have a common difference between them. The general form of an arithmetic sequence is: an = a1 + (n − 1)d, where a1 is the first term, n is the number of the term in the sequence, and d is the common difference.

The sum of the terms in this sequence is: 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 + 16 + 19 = 69

Using the formula for the sum: . The answer checks!

Example

Find the sum of the first ten terms of the sequence an = 28 − n.

Number of term: n
Term value: an = 28 − n
1
28 − 1 = 27 = 128
2
28 − 2 = 26 = 64
3
28 − 3 = 25 = 32
4
28 − 4 = 24 = 16
5
28 − 5 = 23 = 8
6
28 − 6 = 22 = 4
7
28 − 7 = 21 = 2
8
28 − 8 = 20 = 1
9
10
The first ten terms in this sequence are: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, , . Did you notice that each successive term is one-half the previous term? This occurs in a geometric series.

Quick Math Fact

A geometric sequence has terms that increase or decrease by a common multiplier. Each set of consecutive terms have a common ratio between them. The general form of a geometric sequence is: an = a1rn − 1, where a1 is the first term, n is the number of the term in the sequence, and r is the common ratio.

The sum of the terms in this sequence is:

Quick Math Fact

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence can be found with: , where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Using the formula for this sum:

Example

Find the sum of the first four terms of the sequence

Number of term: n	Term value:
1
2
3
4
The first four terms of this sequence are , , , and their sum is .

The numerators increase by 1 with each successive term, and the denominators have increasing exponents. You often will not find formulas to sum sequences like this.

Example

Find a rule that describes the sequence 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, …

This is an arithmetic sequence. Each successive term is 4 greater than the previous term. So you want to write something like “previous term plus 4”.

Traditionally, an n or x or i is used in such rules. Let’s use n and multiply it by 4, since that’s the common difference. Using 4n and inserting a 1 for the n, we get the number 4. But the first term is 10, so we need 6 more. Letting the rule be an = 4n + 6, let’s see what the terms come out to be.

Number of term: n	Term value: 4n + 6
1
4 (1) + 6 = 10
2
4 (2) + 6 = 14
3
4 (3) + 6 = 18
4
4 (4) + 6 = 22
5
4 (5) + 6 = 26
6
4 (6) + 6 = 30
The rule works!

Example

Find a rule that describes the sequence 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, …

This is a power sequence. Each term is a power of the number 3. You write this as an = 3n, where n = 1, 2, 3, …

Special Sums
(Working with special rules for sums of terms in a sequence.)

A sequence is a list of numbers (or letters, in other contexts) that is formed by some special rule or formula. In many applications, it is necessary to add up some or all of the terms in the sequence. Many rules have formulas to use when finding a sum. It’s a good idea to take advantage of these sum formulas; they save time, and they usually are more accurate.

The following are some of the more “popular” special rules:

Description
Example
Sequence rule
Sum formula
Arithmetic sequence	2, 5, 8, 11, …	an = a1 + (n − 1)d	
Geometric sequence	2, 6, 18, 54, …	gn = k · rn − 1	
Integers	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …	an = n	
Squares of integers	1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …	qn = n2	
Cubes of integers	1, 8, 27, 64, 125, …	cn = n3	
Example

Find the sum of the first 50 terms of the arithmetic sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, …

This sequence has a first term of 2 and a common difference of 3.

The sum formula, , uses the first and last terms.

To find the 50th term, use the sequence rule:

Now use the sum formula:

The sum of the first 50 terms of the sequence is 3,775.

Example

Find the sum of the first 10 terms of the geometric sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, …

This sequence has a first term of 2 and a common ratio (multiplier) of 3.

The sum formula, , uses the first term and the ratio. Notice that the “counter” in the summation notation begins with i = 0. This is because the first term isn’t multiplied by 3, just the rest of the terms. Since we only want 10 terms, and we’re starting with the number 0, we’ll go from 0 to 9.

Using the sum formula:

Want to check this out? The terms are: 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, 486, 1458, 4374, 13122, 39366. Go ahead and add them up. Aren’t formulas wonderful?

Example

Find the sum of the first 20 squares 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …

The sum formula is . So just replace the n’s with 20.

Example

Given the twelve scores X = 3, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 14 and that the average score, , is 9, find the sum .

This formula determines the variance of a set of numbers. Replacing the Xi and , the sum reads:

Sums to Infinity and Limits
(Become acquainted with series that have no end.)

How can you add up a list of numbers that has no end? Sounds like a lot of work and an impossible task. But, thanks to the “magic” of mathematics, there are some sums that can be computed, even though the terms in the series go on forever. The best way to show and “prove” this to you is to give some examples. But first, here’s the mathematical rule that makes this possible.

Quick Math Fact

An infinite series that converges has ending terms that are all 0 as the number of terms increases significantly.

The sum of an infinite geometric series where the ratio is between −1 and +1 is found with the formula:

Example

Find the sum of the infinite series

The amount added gets smaller and small, and the total sum never exceeds 2.

Using the formula to get the sum of the infinite series:

The first term is 1, and the ratio is . So

Example

A super ball is dropped from a 64 foot building and bounces back 48 feet, which is of the distance it fell. After hitting the ground again, it bounces back 36 feet—again, of the distance it fell. Assume that this continues forever. What is the total distance that the ball travels?


The distance is twice a geometric series – plus the starting distance:

You can use a formula to find the sum of the infinite series, double that, and then add 64 to get the total distance.

The geometric series has a first term of 48 and a ratio of , so . The total distance is then 2 (192) + 64 = 448 feet.

0.9 Data Analysis - Inference

9. Use the results of data analysis and best-fit lines to determine the strength of relationships and their applications to situations.
Inferring
(Perform interpolation or extrapolation using a regression equation.)

A regression line is a model which is used to describe the relationship between input values and output values in a data set. Below, you see a data set, its plot, the best-fit line, and the regression equation for the average life-expectancy in the Americas. The years of life expectancy is for a person born in that particular year.

Equation

A(t) = 24.1 + 0.2294t, where t is the number of years since 1800 and A(t) is the life expectancy of a person born in that year.

The correlation coefficient for this line is r = 0.98 which is very good; it’s almost “1”.

Example

Using the regression equation, what is the average life expectancy of a person who was born in 1944?

The year 1944 is 144 years since 1800, so the value of t that you use is 144. Substituting into the equation, you have A(144) = 24.1 + 0.2294 (144) = 57.1 years.

This particular example illustrates “interpolation”—making a prediction of a value where the input is between some of the data points. The ages were given for the century and half-century values, not for the years in between.

Example

Using the regression equation, what is the average life expectancy of a person who will be born in 2050?

The year 2050 is 250 years since 1800, so the value of t that you use is 250. Substituting into the equation, you have A(250) = 24.1 + 0.2294 (250) = 81.5 years.

This particular example illustrates “extrapolation”—making a prediction of a value where the input is outside any of the data points. Extrapolation involves the assumption that things will continue as they have been.

Regression
(Examine an equation for a regression line and determine strength of the relationship.)

A regression line is a model which is used to describe the relationship between input values and output values in a data set. The relationship is shown with a figure (the data points and regression line), with a formula (the equation of a line), and with a value or “rating” of the relationship (correlation coefficient).

Example

Graph the data points in the chart showing the number of hours studied by 15 students and the score they received on the exam for which they were studying. Then draw a line through the points, getting as close as possible to as many as possible.

Hours	0	0	1	1	2	3	3	4	4	5	5	5	6	7	7	9
Score	41	35	40	48	50	60	68	60	65	72	66	75	80	84	90	93
Here’s a graph of the points and a line that’s trying to fit or describe them.


As you can see, the points don’t lie on the line. Some points are above, and some are below. You want to have the best fitting line possible—the one that has the smallest total vertical distance between the line and the points. The line chosen is called the regression line and can be used to predict more scores. Assuming that increasing the number of hours studied will increase the score, you can predict what the score would be if a person studied 10 hours or, because no one studied 8 hours, you could predict what that would produce.

Assume that the regression line above has the formula Score = 40 + 6 × h, where h is the number of hours. Using this formula, then a person studying 8 hours would expect a score of 40 + 6 × 8 = 40 + 48 = 88. This point would lie directly on the line, not above or below. But it’s just a prediction.

Example

Given the graph of the data, below, and the regression line with the equation y = 3.4x + 1, would the point (5, 17) lie above or below or on the regression line?


The best way to check to see where the point would lie is to enter x = 5 into the regression equation. This tells you the point on the line.

If y = 3.4x + 1, then, when x = 5, y = 3.4 (5) + 1 = 17 + 1 = 18. The point on the line is (5, 18), so the data point (5, 17) is below the regression line.

A least squares regression line is the line that makes the vertical distances between the data points and that line as small as possible. Each of the distances is squared when the regression coefficient is computed, because a consistent subtraction direction will make some distances positive and some distances negative—they’d cancel one another out.

Example

Graph the points (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 6), and (5, 2). Then compute the vertical distances between these points and the line with the equation y = 0.6x + 2.


The line with the equation y = 0.6x + 2 lies below some points and above others. The distances from the point vertical to a point on the line are shown. Is this the best line that could be found?

Technology is wonderful in that it allows you to determine the least squares regression line and the correlation coefficient, which is sort of a score for the line. All you have to do is put in the data points, and voila! And, just to help you appreciate it even more, the equation of the best-fit line and its correlation coefficient for the four points in the previous example will be computed, below. You can check it with your calculator.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for the best-fit regression line y = ax + b is found when:

The value of the correlation coefficient, r, is found with:

Example

Given the points (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 6), and (5, 2), find the best-fit regression line and the value of the correlation coefficient.

The formulas are full of sums of this and sums of that. It’s best to just make a quick chart and find those values before beginning.

Σy = 16
Σx2 = 54
Σy2 = 74
Σxy = 53
First, to find the value of a, the slope of the regression line:

Now, finding the value of b, the y-intercept:

So the equation of the best-fit line is y = −0.6x + 6.1. This is NOT the line that’s shown. But how good a fit is this “best fit” line?

Computing the value of r:

So what does this correlation coefficient mean? The value of the correlation coefficient ranges from −1 to 1. The closer the coefficient is to 1 or, when negative the closer to −1, the better the fit. If the coefficient for a particular data set is 1, then every point is on the line. If the score is 0.7, then that’s pretty close and a relatively strong score. A score of 0.5 indicates moderate correlation. Statisticians usually like to see scores greater than 0.5 before considering the correlation to be significant.

The same goes for the negative correlations. A score of −1 means a perfect negative correlation. A score of −0.7 is strong negative, −0.5 is a moderate negative correlation. The closer to 1 or −1, the better the model is at predicting future results.

So, in the above example, the correlation of −0.4243 is not very good. There doesn’t seem to be much correlation between the input and the output. They’re “all over the place”.

Again, it is much better to take advantage of technology. Graphing and financial calculators will do these computations quickly and easily.

0.10 Earnings Quality
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

10. Compare methods of computing cost of goods and depreciation so to correctly apply to particular situations.
FIFO vs LIFO
(Compare the cost of doing business using FIFO vs LIFO.)

The acronym FIFO stands for “First In First Out” and LIFO is for “Last In First Out”. In either case, the cost of goods will be deducted from the revenue. It’s the net profit that can change, if the cost has varied over the course of the financial period. If a company wants to show less profit, then they’ll use the accounting system in which the higher costs will be incorporated.

First, though, let’s start with profit, revenue, and cost.

Profit = Revenue − Cost

The equation is pretty straight-forward, although it can get complicated, depending on your business. Beginning with the cost function, you have fixed costs and variable costs. The fixed costs include salaries, insurance, mortgage payments, and so on. These are items that don’t change with the number of items that are produced or sold. On the other hand, there are also variable costs. If the number of items sold increases, then that changes the cost of producing or purchasing those items. You also may have to pay overtime.

The cost function can be represented with: Cost = Fixed cost + Variable cost or C(n) = Fixed + Variable × n where n represents the number of items. Consider the situation where it costs a company $453 to produce each lawn mower, and there are fixed costs of $2500. Then the cost function would read: C(n) = 2500 + 453n.

The revenue function can be pretty simple. You charge so much money for each item. R(n) = price × n. Going back to this lawn mower company, they charge $749 per lawn mower. So R(n) = 749n.

Putting the cost and revenue together, you create the profit function: P(n) = R(n) − C(n). In the case of the lawn mowers, P(n) = 749n − (2500 + 453n) = 296n − 2500.

Example

How many lawn mowers does the company have to sell in order to break even?

A company breaks even when the profit changes from a negative value to a positive value. They have to sell enough to cover all the fixed costs. If P(n) = 296n − 2500, then the number of mowers, n, has to be large enough so you get a positive value after subtracting 2500. To solve for n, let P(n) = 0.

So they have to sell 9 lawn mowers in order to break even and show a positive profit.

The example above assumes that it always costs $453 to make a lawn mower. A lot of times, the cost can fluctuate, depending on the cost of supplies and labor and other factors. Let’s consider the situation where the cost per quarter is as shown.

Example

Determine the cost using FIFO and LIFO.

$497
 80
2
$453
100
3
$444
100
4
$450
 60
The company produces 340 lawn mowers and sells 250 of them. What was the cost of the 250 lawn mowers? It depends on whether you use FIFO or LIFO.

With FIFO, First In First Out, you start at the beginning of the time period. So you take:

The total cost of the 250 lawn mowers is $116,140.

But what do you get using LIFO, Last In First Out? You start at the end of the time period and work backwards:

The total cost of the 250 lawn mowers is $112,170.

Using LIFO, you show a greater profit, because the cost is less. The choice depends on whether you want to impress stock holders more or pay less in taxes.

Depreciation
(Compare methods of computing the depreciation of an item.)

The depreciation of an item is how much of its value has been lost over a particular time period. We’re often told that, as soon as you drive that new car off the lot, you’ve lost $4000 in value. But, in general, the things to consider when determining depreciation are: the original value of the item, its salvage value, and the expected life of the item. Then you employ some depreciation method.

There are many different depreciation methods available. Here are three of them, just to give you an idea of how they can vary.

Straight-line depreciation
Doubling-declining-balance depreciation
Sum-of-years-digits depreciation
Let’s consider the amount of depreciation of a refrigerated delivery truck. Its original cost is $75,000 with a salvage value of $2500 at the end of 10 years.

Example

Determine the depreciation, over a 10 year period, of the truck costing $75,000 with a salvage value of $2500 using straight-line depreciation.

Straight-line depreciation involves just what the name suggests. You can draw a straight line through the declining values of the item on a graph. The value depreciates the same amount every year. So, if it cost $75,000 and the salvage value is $2500, you will depreciate 75,000 − 2,500 = 72,500 over 10 years. Dividing by 10, the depreciation is $7,250 per year. Here’s a table showing the depreciation and value each year.

Year	Begin	Deprec.	End
 1	75,000	7,250	67,750
 2	67,750	7,250	60,500
 3	60,500	7,250	53,250
 4	53,250	7,250	46,000
 5	46,000	7,250	38,750
 6	38,750	7,250	31,500
 7	31,500	7,250	24,250
 8	24,250	7,250	17,000
 9	17,000	7,250	 9,750
10	 9,750	7,250	 2,500
Example

Determine the depreciation, over a 10 year period, of the truck costing $75,000 with a salvage value of $2500 using double-declining-balance depreciation.

If an item has a ten year life, then, with straight-line depreciation, it would depreciate by 10% each year.

But, with double-declining-balance, it declines by 20% per year. How can that be, you ask? That would add up to 200%! But the way this works is that the beginning-of-year value declines by 20%, not the original value each year. So you multiply each beginning-of-the-year value by 20% to determine the depreciation for that year. You’ll have to “fudge” at the end—it doesn’t come out to the salvage value when you reduce by 20%. So you make a special adjustment in the final year. The following table shows you how this works.

Year	Begin	20% Deprec.	End
 1	75,000	
15,000
60,000

* The depreciation will have to be $7,566 for it to come out to be the salvage value.
Example

Determine the depreciation, over a 10 year period, of the truck costing $75,000 with a salvage value of $2500 using the sum-of-years-digits method.

This method loads the greatest amount of depreciation toward the beginning of the life of the item.

First you add up the years’ digits. There are 10 years, so you add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55. This gives you the denominator of fractions that will have all the digits as numerators.

These all add up to 1, of course. Using this method of depreciation, you start with the largest fraction, at the end, and use it as that year’s depreciation. Then you work your way down the list. Multiply each of these times the original value minus the salvage value, so you’ll end up with the salvage value.

The first year will have ; the second year will have , and so on. The table shows you how this works.

0.11 Accounting Cycle and Adjusting Journal Entries
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Explain the accounting cycle.
2. Describe the role of adjusting journal entries.
Explain the Accounting Cycle
Explaining accounting and how it works starts with an understanding of the accounting cycle. This is where the full process of accounting begins, ends, and starts all over. To begin this discussion, let us first think about the operating cycle.

The business world operates within the operating cycle—the process of turning cash back into cash. For a merchandising company, an operating cycle functions as shown in Exhibit 0.11.1.

Why This Matters to Business
While all the functions of an operating cycle are occurring within a business, activities within the accounting cycle are also occurring. Information is being tracked by an accounting information system so companies can see how they are doing operationally. Without accurate and timely financial information, there is no way to know if a company is meeting its targets, even if the company seems to be operating effectively. Thus, an understanding of accounting and how it works, at least on a basic level is important for all individuals involved in the financial side of a business.

EXHIBIT 0.11.1


The Accounting Cycle
Now let’s start thinking about the accounting cycle (Exhibit 0.11.2). The accounting cycle begins the minute an economic event or transaction occurs. Let’s think of a trip to your local Grocery Mart. When a customer walks up to a self-checkout line to buy a tube of toothpaste and the product is scanned, an economic event has occurred. In order for Grocery Mart to operate both efficiently and effectively, every time a tube of toothpaste is scanned and purchased, the store needs to have an accounting record of it. Think of the accounts being affected when this occurs. Grocery Mart has received Cash or payment via a credit card. A Sale has occurred. Inventory has been reduced, and thus Cost of Goods Sold should be recognized. All of these accounts must be properly recorded in the accounting records in order for Grocery Mart to make informed decisions using accurate information.

Why This Matters to Business
Each of these accounts is affected based on one swipe of the bar code on a tube of toothpaste at a self- checkout machine. If this transaction is not properly recorded, the accounts will not be correct.

EXHIBIT 0.11.2


Stop and Consider: What is a possible consequence if the accounting information is inaccurate?

Grocery Mart could run out of a specific type of toothpaste if managers did not know the store was running low at a particular point in time. Customers could get frustrated and shop elsewhere!

All transactions find their way to the accounting system in the form of a journal entry, either by a direct journal entry or a summary journal entry lumping many, many transactions into one entry. Just think about how many invoices a company might receive in any given day. If each transaction was posted as a separate entry accounting, it would take too many hours so the transactions are often batched by days. After the journal entries have been recorded in the system, they are posted to the general ledger. Posting to the general ledger is how the results of sales transactions that involve Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold become part of the accounting and information system.


Example

Suppose the Food Giant grocery chain received an invoice for payment for a shipment of pasta it purchased to sell as inventory. An economic event or transaction has occurred. Someone in the accounts payable department must now input the invoice into the system. Once input, the invoice becomes part of an automated system, allowing the company’s accounting and information system to create a journal entry for the transaction.

The invoice will be entered into the system by the following journal entry.

Debit	Pasta Inventory	xxx	 
Credit	    Accounts Payable, Pasta Company	 	xxx
This journal entry is posted into the general ledger.

Once all entries have been posted for a particular time period, a trial balance is prepared. A trial balance shows the balance of all active accounts, and total debits and credits must always be equal. This is due to the double-entry accounting system. Mathematical mistakes and erroneous postings often become apparent if a trial balance does not balance. Once a trial balance is complete, a worksheet may be utilized to help prepare financial statements. A worksheet helps verify the accuracy of the accounting information before the formal financial statements are prepared. The worksheet is typically considered optional. This is because the automated accounting and information systems used today often do much of this verification for you. Errors are often noted as soon as the transaction was entered into the system, long before a worksheet was ever prepared.


At this point in the accounting cycle, it is time to prepare adjusting journal entries. This is necessary order to adhere to both the revenue and expense recognition principles, which must be abided by in accounting. An easy way to understand this is by thinking of the fact that revenues should be recorded when earned, regardless of when they are received and expenses are recognized when used or incurred. It would be great if every customer paid companies immediately for goods and services received, but we all know this is not the case. Adjusting journal entries allow us to record the revenue earned in the current accounting period, even if payment is actually received several accounting periods in the future.

Financial Statements
Once adjusting journal entries are complete, the financial statements are prepared. These statements are utilized by investors, creditors, analysts, and more. The three main financial statements are:

Income statement.
Balance sheet.
Statement of cash flows.
Closing the Books
Closing the books is the last step in the accounting cycle. In this process, all temporary or nominal accounts are closed out to a zero balance in order to start at a zero balance at the beginning of the next fiscal year. Temporary accounts are those primarily on the income statement. The balance sheet accounts are considered permanent and are not closed. In other words, these accounts keep accumulating from one fiscal year to the next. An income statement account, however, is a temporary account that is closed into retained earnings at the end of the fiscal year.

Stop and Consider : What happens to net income once it is closed at the end of the year?

If net income just kept building from one year to the next, you would never really know how a company was performing in the current year. One final item to understand is this: when the income statement accounts are closed, where do they go? They do not just vanish! The answer to this question is that they go to the balance sheet through the Retained Earnings account. In this way, the income statement lives on from one year to the next. Net income or net loss for the year ends up as part of retained earnings on the balance sheet.


From this point, the accounting cycle repeats itself. Each fiscal year end marks the end of an accounting period, and once a year ends, a new year quickly begins. The accounting cycle continues.

Describe the Role of Adjusting Journal Entries
Adjusting Journal Entries Revisited
Most activities are recorded through basic journal entries directly by an accounting and information system or by an individual recording operational activity. Some activities, however, such as receiving revenues in advance, paying expenses in advance, incurring expenses but not yet paying for them, or earning revenue but not yet receiving it, require adjustments. This is where adjusting journal entries come into play.

Example

On December 31, Logan must pay rent to her landlord at The Flats for the month of January. When this occurs, from Logan’s perspective, a deferred or prepaid expense has been incurred. At the end of January, an adjusting journal entry is necessary in order to properly state the account balances and to therefore properly present the financial statements.

Logan prepays one month’s rent on December 31. The journal entry to record the rent payment is:

Debit	Prepaid Rent	xxx	
Credit	    Cash		xxx
On January 31, once the prepaid month is over, the adjusting journal entry is:

Debit	Rent Expense	xxx	
Credit	    Prepaid Rent	 	xxx
Initially the prepaid rent is recorded in into an asset account. After the rent is utilized, it is transferred into an expense account. Think of it as the rent cost being expired. It was a prepaid asset, as it was paid ahead of time. Once the month of January came to an end, that prepaid asset was used up: time to recognize it as an expense.

The same example can be looked at from the landlord’s perspective. The Flats received Logan’s money on December 31 before it had been earned. (Because of the revenue recognition principle, the revenue for rent cannot be recognized by the landlord until the month is over.) The journal entry to record the receipt of rent payment on January 1 is

Debit	Cash	xxx	 
Credit	    Unearned Rent	 	xxx
The Unearned Rent account is a liability because The Flats owes Logan something it owes her one month of living at its apartment complex.

Initially the rent is recognized as a liability account. After the month of living at the apartment complex has been provided to the tenant, it is recognized in a revenue account. The Flats no longer owes Logan living space for the month of January. It has earned revenue for the month that she lived there.

On January 31, the adjusting journal entry to record the month’s rent that is now earned is:

Debit	Unearned Rent	xxx	 
Credit	    Rent Revenue	 	xxx
The focus of the adjusting journal entry examples is rent. This is because most students pay rent at some point during their college career. It may be useful to think about another concept that most of you have had experience with, which is car insurance. Many students have had to think about car insurance at some point in time, and the principles are the same as for rent. Typically, rent is paid in advance, which means the lessee (tenant) has a prepaid asset that needs to be expensed over time and the lessor (landlord) has a liability that turns into revenue when earned. The same is true with insurance. The vehicle owner pays in advance and therefore has a prepaid asset, and the insurance provider receives payment in advance and has a liability is earned and reported as revenue as the insurance period expires. If you would like to think of adjusting journal entries with an additional, relatable example, substitute the word insurance for rent in the examples above.

Summary
Knowing how to explain the accounting cycle is a great skill to have. It helps you better understand the information that will be presented to you throughout your career in finance. When making financial decisions based on accounting data that will be provided to you, it will be helpful to have an overall understanding of the source of the accounting information. Although creating adjusting journal entries from scratch is typically not a part of a corporate analyst’s job responsibilities, understanding the theory behind adjusting journal entries goes a long way toward improving your confidence in utilizing accounting information. If you can describe the role of adjusting journal entries and understand their purpose, you will be able to demonstrate a stronger understanding of accounting. Accounting is known as the language of business. The more you learn this language, the stronger you will be throughout the many financial conversations that will occur in your future.

0.12 Income Statement
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Discuss the usefulness of the income statement.
2. Demonstrate income statement formats.
3. Explain how the income statement relates to other key financial statements.
Business activities and overall financial performance are reflected in a company’s financial statements. There are three main financial statements that financial statement users work with:

Income Statement.
Balance Sheet.
Statement of Cash Flows.
This section explains the income statement.

Usefulness of the Income Statement
The income statement shows a company’s revenues and expenses, as well as gains and losses for a period. This statement shows overall profits or losses for a company. Overall profits are referred to as net income, and overall losses are referred to as net loss. Many people feel that the income statement is the “exciting” or “go to” statement. Most decisions about a company, after all, are aided by knowing more about the company’s net income or net loss over the past few years.

1. Stop and Consider: How is an income statement helpful if you are considering investing in a company?

When making an investment in a company, it is important to see how the company has been performing, not only in the current period but also in recent years. You may wish to invest in a company that is performing well in hopes of gaining from that company’s success. You may also wish to invest in a company that is performing poorly in hopes of reaping the benefits of a company turnaround, by buying stock low and selling high after recovery. Regardless of your investment strategy, the income statement will provide you with key information about a company’s performance. This will allow you to make informed investment decisions.

The income statement, as well as the balance sheet and statement of cash flows, is used for other decisions, such as whether to lend a company money or whether to accept a position as an employee at a company. The list of uses for the income statement can become extensive. The uses referred to so far are based on external user decisions. Decisions such as whether to maintain a particular business operation or to discontinue it, whether to continue to make a production part or to buy it from an outside supplier, or whether to hire an additional supervisor to oversee a growing operation are internal user decisions. The income statement can help with all these decisions, both external and internal.

Example

Jordan just graduated with a finance degree from Green State. She has developed an interest in the manufacturing industry. Due to high grades and active involvement in her community, Jordan received two job offers within the auto parts manufacturing industry. Both offers are similar in salary and benefits. In deciding which company to work for, Jordan will look at personality match, corporate culture, location, and many other qualitative factors. She will most likely also look at quantitative data available for the companies. She will look at net income and net loss data for recent years. She may also look at trends in sales revenue to see if one company is performing better than the other. She may even look at expenses and see how efficiently the companies are operating by comparing total expenses to total sales revenue. There are many ways the company income statements may be useful to Jordan in her decision process.

2. Stop and Consider: How can external users rely on information provided by a company when those users have no access to any of the company’s financial records to verify what they are seeing?

Most larger companies are audited by independent third parties. In fact, the SEC requires all publicly traded companies to be audited before their stock can be on a public securities exchange. Many private and not-for-profit companies are audited as well. So if you ever wonder if you can trust a company’s income statement to be a fair reflection of what actually occurred, look to see if the company has auditied financial staements with an annual audit report. Educating yourself on the audit report is another tool that can prove to be useful during your financial career. You should learn to read it carefully enough to see if the company has any major issues.

Income Statement Formats
The income statement has two common formats: the single-step format and the multiple-step format. Both formats are acceptable under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and are widely used in the business world. Publicly traded companies often use the multiple-step format, as it provides more detail. It is important to note that regardless of which format is used, the final net income amount will be the same. This will be demonstrated in the examples below.

The single-step format is utilized by companies that value simplicity. With the single-step format, all revenues and gains are grouped together to form a single category. All expenses and losses are grouped in the same way. This allows a basic presentation that even non-financial-minded individuals can follow. It allows the question, “Do revenues and gains exceed expenses and losses?” to be quickly and easily answered. (See Exhibit 0.12.1).

EXHIBIT 0.12.1 Single-Step Income Statement

In this illustration, financial statement users can quickly determine that Shoe Manufacturing Inc. had a positive net income. They can see that at the end of the fiscal year, the company had generated $48,700 of net income. For many financial statement users, this is enough information.

Example

Should you go to work for Shoe Manufacturing Inc.? As mentioned above, qualitative factors should be considered. From a quantitative perspective, however, a single-step income statement can tell you that Shoe Manufacturing Inc. is operating profitably, and this may be all the information you need before accepting the position. A financial statement user may not need or want more detail than this. On the other hand, if you also have a job offer from a company that has a net income of $500,000, perhaps you would choose that company instead. Either way, looking at the single-step income statement can aid you in choosing between potential employers.

3. Stop and Consider: When you graduate with your finance degree, will you be able to fix a broken pipe, defend someone in a court of law, or teach a third grader how to do long division? Your finance degree probably will not prepare you for those tasks. In the same way, a plumber, attorney, and elementary school teacher may not be able to interpret complicated financial statements. The single-step income statement, however, allows financial statement users with many different backgrounds, including the ones discussed here, to utilize financial statements. Given its simplicity, this form of statement can be useful to a wide range of users.

The multiple-step format is utilized by companies who prefer more detail. The statement is broken down into categories that many find useful in making key decisions. Gross margin and operational margins are easier to compare in this format, as you can see in Exhibit 0.12.2.

EXHIBIT 0.12.2 Multiple-Step Income Statement

Shoe Manufacturing Inc.
Multiple-Step Income Statement
For the Year Ended December 31, 2021
Sales	 	$50,000 
Less:	 	 	 
  Cost of Goods Sold	3,500 	 
Gross Margin	 	$46,500
 	 	 	 
Operational Expenses	 	 	 
  Depreciation Expense	 	$  2,000 	 
  Salary and Wages Expense	 	11,000 	 
  Utility Expense	 	5,000 	 
Total Operating Expenses	 	$18,000
 	 	 	 
Other Revenues and Expenses	 	 
  Interest Revenue	$12,000 	 
  Gain on Sale of Plant Assets	9,500 	 
  Loss on Sale of Plant Assets	(1,300)	 
Total Other Revenues and Expense	$20,200
 	 	 	 
Net Income	 	 	$48,700
 	 	 	 
In this illustration, you can see that the net income of $48,700 is the same for both the single-step and the multiple-step income statement. You can also see that a financial statement user has more detail to evaluate in a multiple-step income statement. Instead of all revenues and gains being summarized together, they are broken apart into subcategories to provide more useful data. If you see gross margin when looking at an income statement, you are looking at a multiple-step statement. This category shows you how much a company is making from the actual product. In this example, Shoe Manufacturing Inc. is generating $46,500 from the sale of the product.

Gross profit is useful for financial statement users in making decisions. If you are trying to see how well a company is doing, it is helpful to initially see how much that company is making directly from the sale of the product. Companies that have very high marketing budgets, for example, need to be generating a very high margin on the product itself to support the operating expenses they rely on. Think about Nike. Nike needs to make a significant amount of money from the sale of a pair of shoes to offset its selling and administrative costs. A quick review of a multiple-step income statement can help you analyze that.

A gross profit margin calculation performed for Shoe Manufacturing Inc. will include the following:

Shoe Manufacturing Inc. has a gross profit margin of 93 percent.

4. Stop and Consider: Can you name one key reason why knowing Shoe Manufacturing Inc’s gross profit margin would help you analyze and better understand the company? One key factor is that it allows you to compare Shoe Manufacturing Inc.’s gross profit margin with those of other companies in the same industry. It is always important to compare your company’s gross profit margin to others in the industry. For example, 93 percent may seem high for Shoe Manufacturing Inc., but if all other major competitors in the industry are at 95 percent or more, the 93 percent could be worrisome. Small percentages can mean a lot in the competitive business world we live in.

The mutliple-step income statement also breaks down selling and adminstrative expenses in the operating expenses section of the income statement. Other gains and losses that are outside of the company’s regular operations are reported in their own section. Many financial statement users rely on the information provided in these categories to make key financial decisions because other revenues and gains, and other expenses and losses are not usually recurring.

How the Income Statement Relates to Other Key Financial Statements
Before we move on from the income statement to the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows, it is important to understand how the income statement relates to each.

Once final net income or net loss has been determined for a period, the amount is transferred into Retained Earnings on the balance sheet. Retained Earnings is increased or decreased each year by the amount of profit or loss a company has made. When net income or loss is closed out each year on the income statement, the dollar amount of the income or loss is moved into Retained Earnings, which is a permanent account on the balance sheet that is not closed out at year end. In this way, the income statement lives on from year to year, even though it is closed out at year end.

The current year net income or net loss is the starting point for the operating section of the statement of cash flows. Since net income is reported on the accrual-basis (both net income and the SCF are based on GAAP, and the reason there is a reconciliation is to convert accrual basis to cash basis and the statement of cash flows is reported on a cash basis, the statement of cash flows starts out by reconciling the GAAP-based net income to cash basis.

In order to be complete and properly stated, the balance sheet and statement of cash flows rely on a proper net income or net loss amount. (See Exhibit 0.12.3).

EXHIBIT 0.12.3 Net Income Links the Three Main Financial Statements


Summary
The income statement is useful in many different ways. As a finance major, you will most likely find both external and internal uses of the information reported in this statement. Being able to utilize the income statement to make key decisions both personally and for your company is a useful skill. Recognizing the different formats of an income statement is also important. Companies can decide which format they would prefer to utilize. You will see both formats as you continue to analyze more companies in the future. Understanding the similarities and differences between the single-step and the multiple-step income statements can be helpful. Finally, having an overall understanding of how the income statement results impact both the balance sheet and statement of cash flows can improve your overall financial knowledge. Next, we will look more closely at the balance sheet.

0.13 Balance Sheet
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Discuss the usefulness of the balance sheet.
2. Demonstrate the balance sheet format.
3. Explain how the balance sheet relates to other key financial statements.
Usefulness of the Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company’s financial position at a specific point in time. It provides detail about the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity, showing what a company owns and owes. The balance sheet has many uses. Knowing what a company’s net worth is and understanding whether a company should be able to make its payments and sustain operations with its working capital are some of the key uses. Both accounting and finance professionals find this information useful.

A company’s net worth is determined by subtracting liabilities from assets. Every company will determine its net worth goals and requirements, and they can be very different from company to company. Typically, companies prefer a high net worth, but there are instances when a company may have a negative net worth and still continue to operate, as long as cash flow can be managed and creditors are being paid. (Obviously, the latter is not ideal.) Almost all companies, however, share the goal of being able to pay for liabilities from existing assets. Most companies hope to pay for current liabilities from current assets. Working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. Individuals looking at investing and creditors looking at lending money will often calculate working capital. Working capital is a good way to determine whether or not a company has strong liquidity.

Stop and Consider: How can a balance sheet help you quickly determine if a company of interest has good liquidity?

If you learn how to recognize which types of assets and liabilities are current, the math is typically simple. Often, balance sheets have the current assets and current liabilities nicely classified! If not provided, you can learn to identify which assets are current, such as cash, receivables, and inventory. You can also learn to identify which liabilities are current, such as accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and dividends payable. Once identified, you can calculate and utilize working capital in your decision-making process.

Example

Joshua Tree Inc. has the following balances (in thousands): Cash $352; Receivables $225; Inventory $180, Property, Plant, and Equipment $680; Accounts Payable $136; Accrued Interest $85; Dividends Payable $45; and Long-Term Notes Payable $800. No other asset or liability accounts exist. What is the company’s net worth and what is its working capital?

Stop and Consider: Can there be a negative consequence of incorrectly classifying current assets and current liabilities?

Improper operational decisions can be made if you improperly classify current versus noncurrent assets and liabilities. In the Joshua Tree example above, notice that net worth is a different amount than working capital. If you were making an inventory-related decision, for example, and you did not realize that property, plant, and equipment and notes payable were noncurrent, you might make your inventory decision based on $371 (net worth) instead of the proper $491 (working capital) amount. This may alter your decision process in some way.

Did You Know

You should be aware that GAAP-based reporting standards in the United States differ from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). One of the major differences is that IFRS may reports assets such as PP&E at market or fair value, whereas U.S. GAAP reports at historical cost, This is especially important if, during your finance career, you find yourself comparing a U.S.-based company to a company based in a country that uses IFRS. The old phrase you are not comparing apples to apples becomes relevant. When studying both companies’ assets, it will be important to remember that one company may be reporting at historical cost while the other is reporting at fair value. This can be a significant factor in the analysis.

While considering the usefulness of the balance sheet, it is important to recognize that with financial statements based on U.S. GAAP, the reported amounts represent the assets historical cost. This means that no matter how long ago the asset was purchased, the value on the balance sheet is historical or original cost, not market value. One area most affected by this is Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E).

Stop and Consider: A building is a great example of PP&E that is heavily impacted by historical cost valuation. Think of a building bought 20 years ago in a city that was suffering extreme financial hardship. That same city today has once again become a thriving metropolitan area. The building could have been purchased 20 years ago for $500,000 but today could have a market value of $2,000,000. The $500,000 would still be reflected on a GAAP-based balance sheet, while the $2,000,000 is nowhere to be found. How could this impact a financial statement user?

Regardless of initial or not, the building is still reflected as cost less accumulated depreciation. Replace this part of the sentence with: On the financial statements, the building would reflect the $500,000 historical cost, less the accumulated depreciation that has been recorded. For all decisions that are asset-based, such as a company’s net worth, asset values could be substantially less than what the assets are truly worth in the marketplace. Both accounting and finance professionals see the flaws in this way of presentation. The difficulty and expense of determining what market value is at any point in time is part of the reason U.S. GAAP requires reporting at historical cost versus maket value.

The Balance Sheet Format
The balance sheet is structured around the basic accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder’s Equity. The format of the balance sheet is actually designed around this equation (see Exhibit 0.13.1).

EXHIBIT 0.13.1


Did You Know?

Another difference between GAAP and IFRS that relates to this section is the reporting of assets and liablities according to liquidity. IFRS lists noncurrent assets before current assets and noncurrent liablities before current liailities. IFRS uses the opposite order, reporting the least liquid items first. So again, if you find yourself at some point in your future looking at international financial statements, make sure you are aware of this difference.

To look at an example, see Exhibit 3-1 Diaz Manufacturing Balance Sheets as of December 31.

Looking at this example, you can see that total assets (on the left side of the statement) equal total Liablities and equity (on the right side). The double-entry accounting system ensures that debits equal credits, so the total of both side of the statement. Note that more than one year of financial information is provided. Most balance sheets provide the current year’s balance as well as the previous year’s for comparison purposes. This allows a financial statement user to quickly compare asset, liability, and equity amounts from one period to the next. This information allows users to calculate key financial ratios or simply do a quick change-in-balance analysis—comparing this year’s cash balance to last, for example.

A classified balance sheet has clear subtotals for current assets and current liabilities and noncurrent liablities. It is helpful when these categories are nicely laid out for you, but if they are not, a basic understanding of current versus noncurrent is useful. Later, in our ratio section, we will look at some key ratios in which current versus noncurrent classifications can make a big difference in how calcualtion ends up.

Finally, within the various classifications of current assets and current liabilities, the assets and liabilites are listed in order of liquidity (e.g., how quickly an asset can be converted to cash that will be readily available for the company to use). For example, cash is most liquid, followed by accounts receivable and then inventory. On the liablility side, accounts payable, notes payable, and accrued taxes are considered current, whereas long-term debt is noncurrent.

How the Balance Sheet Relates to Other Key Financial Statements
As discussed earlier, once net income is finalized, it increases retained earnings on the balance sheet. Although retained earnings is a component of the balance sheet, companies often have a separate stockholders’ equity detailing the components of the retained earnings balance for the period. When the statement of retained earnings is present, net income is added and dividends declared are subtracted from the beginning balance of retained earnings to calculate the year-end balance.

Another key relationship to understand is how cash on the balance sheet compares to cash on the statement of cash flows (Exhibit 0.13.2). On the balance sheet, you can see the beginning balance of cash and the ending balance of cash. You see this in the comparative numbers when both the current- and prior-year financials are provided. That same cash amounts are represented as the beginning and ending cash amounts on the statement of cash flows, but in this statement, the activities that caused the changes in cash are explained. The next section will cover the statement of cash flows in greater detail.

EXHIBIT 0.13.2


Summary
The balance sheet helps financial statement users with the decision-making process in many ways. Providing amounts to be used to determine amounts such as net worth and working capital is one example. Despite the usefulness of the balance sheet, there are limitations. One primary limitation is the fact that, under U.S. GAAP, some items are presented at historical cost rather than at current value. Despite this limitation, financial statement users can gain useful information by comparing account balances from one year to the next. Understanding liquidity is critical to a company’s successful operations. The accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity, represents how the balance sheet is presented. Finally, the three main financial statements are all linked together, as illustrated in this module.

0.14 Statement of Cash Flows
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Discuss the usefulness of the statement of cash flows.
2. Demonstrate the format of the statement of cash flows.
3. Explain how the statement of cash flows relates to other key financial statements.
Usefulness of the Statement of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows is a financial statement that helps users understand not just how much cash changed in a reporting period, but also how it changed. Business students often only think of the income statement and balance sheet when asked to analyze a company’s financial statements, not even giving the statement of cash flows an initial thought. The reality is, however, that the statement of cash flows is a highly useful tool for ensuring that a company can continue to operate effectively into the future. Without this statement, a change in cash balance can be deceiving.

Stop and Consider: Think of a company that had $400,000 cash at the beginning of the period but and $600,000 at the end of the period. Would your initial feeling be positive or negative when you learned that the overall cash balance went up $200,000?

Most financial statement users would feel very positive about a $200,000 increase in cash. Who would not like a larger verses a smaller balance of cash, after all? The reality is, however, that if the $200,000 increase came solely as the result of a $250,000 loan, the increase is not as positive as it initially seemed. Overall cash went up $200,000 in this example, but overall debt went up $250,000. So cash did increase, but at what cost? The company now has a lot of additional debt to repay.

In order for a company to continue to operate in the long run, the company must have positive income from operations. Likewise, in order for a company to be able to rely on proper cash flows in the long run, the company must have positive cash flow from the regular operations of its business. The statement of cash flows shows how much cash is being provided by, or used by, the operations of the business. The cash provided by the operations of a business is the cash from the company’s main line of operations For example, a shoe manufacturer generates profit and cash by selling its shoes and other related products. A doctor’s office generates profit and cash by providing healthcare services. The income received from the sale of shoes and heatlhcare services is considered operational. The statement of cash flows identifies the cash that was brought into or taken out of the company based on the operational components of the business.

Stop and Consider: Here are three sources of cash for a company the company can sell its products or services, sell a fixed asset that it owns, or borrow money. Of the three examples, which way is the most favorable and why?

The best way in the long-run for a company to bring in cash is through its operations, by selling its products or services. Although selling a fixed asset that has possibly appreciated in value can be very positive, and clearly brings in positive cash flow, this is not something that can be relied on regularly in the future. Companies have limited fixed assets, so selling them in order to achieve positive cash flow is not sustainable in the long-run. Finally, a company would not want to borrow money each time there was a need for cash.

As you learn more about the format of the statement of cash flows, it will become more apparent how useful the statement can be.

The Format of the Statement of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows exists in two common formats: direct and indirect. There are advantages and disadvantages to each method. The direct method is the preferred method according to the rule-making authorities in the accounting profession, as it is more transparent to users. This method shows the primary cash receipts and cash payments for the period. The disadvantage to the direct method is the time and expense involved in maintaining the accounting records in a way that makes this method possible. Separate accounting records, above and beyond regularly used accounting system records, are often required. The indirect method is preferred by most companies. The method starts with A reconciliation of net income to cash flows provided or used by operating activities. For this reason, almost all U.S. companies you will analyze will present their statements of cash flows in the indirect format. The format of the indirect method, therefore, will be the focus of our attention in this section.

Did You Know: You learned that under U.S. GAAP, we can use one of two methods: direct and indirect. Although the direct method is preferred, the indirect method is the most frequently used. If you find yourself analyzing international financial statements, however, you will most likely examine a direct method statement of cash flows. It is therefore important for you to know that this format exists. It is quite common for finance majors to analyze international financial statements at some point during their careers.

The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows prepared under the indirect method begins with a reconciliation of net income to cash provided or used by operating activities. This reconciliation appears in the operating activities section of the statement. Examine Exhibit 3.4 Diaz Manufacturing Statement of Cash Flows for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31 in your textbook. You can see when you look at this example that the statement includes three main sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.

The operating activities of the statement of cash flows begins with net income as reported on the income statement, which is Net income on the income statement is reported according to accrual-based accounting. Revenue is recorded when it is earned and expenses when they are incurred, not when the cash is received and paid. The statement of cash flows shows operating activities on a cash basis. For this reason, we start by adding back noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization to net income. Depreciation, for example, is an expense that reduces net income but has no cash impact. Therefore, in the operating activities section reconciliation, you must add this noncash expense back. You also need to reverse the effects of gains or losses from the period. This is because gains are added to net income but have no cash impact. Losses reduced net income though no cash if paid. Finally, you must also make adjustments for changes that occured in non-cash current assets and current liabilities during the period. These changes impact net income differently than they do cash and must be reconciled back to the cash basis. Fortunately, only the “net” change in each non-cash current asset and current liability account must be reported.

Example

TBL Products, Inc., has net income of $350,000 for the period. Depreciation expense was $40,000, gains were $35,000, losses were $25,000, current assets increased by $10,000, and current liabilties increased by $15,000. What is the overall cash provided by or used by operations?

Cash provided by operations = $385,000 ($350,000 + $40,000 − $35,000 + $25,000 − $10,000 + $15,000)

An increase in current assets must be deducted from net income, and an increase in current liabilities must be added. Rule of thumb: If current assets increase, subtract the change from if they decrease, add the change to If current liablities increase, add the change to if they decrease, subtract the change from

In this case, it looks like TBL has a healthy amount of cash being brought in from the operational part of the business; $385,000 is being provided by operations.

The investing activities section of a statement of cash flows shows how a company utilized cash related to investing activities for the period. Another way of thinking of it is that the investing activities section reports what happens because a company “has money and wants to make money.” Let’s think about a couple of examples. A company has money and wants make money Another example occurs when a company invests in fixed assets that help support operations of the business either directly or indirectly. When it buys the fixed asset, it uses cash, and when it sells the asset, it receives cash. It is important to keep in mind here that if the investment security or fixed asset is sold at a gain or a loss, the cash received is reported in the investing section, but the gain or loss is reported as an adjustment in the operating section.

The financing activities section of a statement of cash flows shows how a company raises capital and pays its investors and lenders back. Another way of thinking of this is that the company “needs money and has to get money.” If a company needs cash, it might be able to attain it by borrowing money with a short-term non-working capital or long-term note. It may also obtain additional cash by issuing shares of its own stock. These are all considered financing activities. Thus, whether a company is receiving cash from a short-term loan or using cash by paying back a short-term loan, this is reported in the financing section. Likewise, if a company is issuing stock to receive cash or buying back its own stock utilizing cash, this is reported in the financing section. Because it relates to the issued stock, paying a dividend to stockholders is also reported in the financing section.

Example

TBL Products, Inc. received cash this period in the following amounts: $600,000 from the sale of products for cash, $30,000 from selling a long-term investment security for cash, $25,000 from selling a company truck, $75,000 from taking out a short-term loanfor non-working capital purposes and $100,000 from taking out a long-term loan. How much cash was provided by investing activities and financing activities?

Cash Provided by Investing Activities = $55,000 ($30,000 + $25,000)

Cash Provided by Financing Activites = $175,000 ($75,000 + $100,000)

How the Statement of Cash Flows Relates to Other Key Financial Statements
The statement of cash flows is tied to both the income statement and the balance sheet (Exhibit 0.14.1). As we discussed in this section, the indirect method of reporting the statement of cash flows begins with a reconciliation of net income as reported on the income statement. This net income figure is the accrual-based figure acceptable according to GAAP. The statement of cash flows begins with the GAAP-based net income and reconciles it to cash provided or used by operations.

The statement of cash flows reports the same beginning and ending balance in cash as the balance sheet does. Looking at a balance sheet gives you no idea how a cash balance increased or decreased. Changes in the cash balance are explained in the statement of cash flows. Studying a company’s cash activity is a critical part of the financial analysis of a company, and the statement of cash flows provides information needed for analysis.

Note: The net operating cash flows, the net investing cash flow, and the net financing cash flow are added together to arrive at net cash provided by or used by the company for the period. The resulting change in the ending cash balance is the same for both the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows.

EXHIBIT 0.14.1 The Statement of Cash Flows Linked to Other Financial Statements


Summary
The statement of cash flows is a useful tool in determining how cash is obtained and utilized in a company. A study of a company’s statement of cash flows will tell you not just what the change in cash balance was from one period to the next, but how the cash balance changed. It is important to understand that a company’s operating activities must remain positive in order to sustain the company over long time periods. A company must to provide most of its cash through operations, not through investing activities, or financing activities, which can add debt or ownership equity. If a company is not obtaining proper cash flow from operations, the company’s ability to continue to operate into the future could be of concern. It is important for an informed financial statement user to be aware of this. Overall, all three primary financial statements are very useful to investors. The statement of cash flows is the statement that answers key questions about cash.

Accounting for Finance Majors
0.15 Impact of Accounting on Key Financial Ratios
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Discuss the usefulness of ratios in accounting.
2. Demonstrate the accounting impact on income statement–based, balance sheet–based, and statement of cash flows–based ratios.
3. Summarize the relationship between accounting and finance.
Usefulness of Ratios in Accounting
In this module, you have learned about the accounting cycle usefulness of the financial statements In this final section, you will learn how ratios are tools that utilize accounting data to provide powerful information to decision makers, both internal and external. This is information that the amounts on the face of the financial statements alone cannot provide.

Ratios and ratio analysis can take the two-dimensional information from financial statements and create a three-dimensional view of the company, giving the decision maker significant insigh’t. for use in the decision-making process. Proper understanding of the components of the ratios is key to your overall understanding of ratio analysis. The focus of this section is to explain the impact accounting has on the ratios that you will thoroughly analyze and utilize during your career in finance.

In accounting, users calculate financial ratios periodically in order to provide information used in decision making. Internally, financial ratios are utilized to help managers control production expenses, monitor the timely collection of receivables, and assist in determining the most profitable mix of products to offer customers. Ratios also provide managers with valuable inputs to make key financial decisions such as an investment in a new machine or manufacturing process. Externally, financial ratios are utilized by users to help make key financial decisions such as whether or not to invest in a company, whether to grant a company a loan, and whether to engage a company as a key vendor in a supply chain.

In an audit of financial statements, ratios are used during the planning, testing, and completion phases. They are used to do things like direct attention to areas that need to be focused on during the audit. They are used to find relationships between account balances that prove or disprove the reasonableness of the balances. They are also used to show areas that might have needed more attention and were overlooked throughout the course of the audit.

Ratios are heavily utilized in accounting and finance. In this final module, we will focus on some key ratios from each of the financial statements and how a solid understanding of the accounting components of the ratios can help your overall understanding of the ratios you will use regularly throughout your career.

Did You Know: Most of the time when we think of ratio analysis we think of ratios with common formulas that have easily recognized numerators and demoninators. Sometimes, however, you can simply take the beginning and ending balance of an account and look at the percentage change from one period to the next. By comparing this to changes in past years and to changes that are presently occurring within an industry, you can learn a lot about a company’s financial situation.

Example

TBL Product Inc. had an inventory balance of $450,000 as of 12/31/2020. As of 12/31/2021, the company had an inventory balance of $350,000. Clearly, the inventory balance declined by $100,000. Upon further analysis, however, you can see that it actually went down by 22% [($450,000–$350,000)/$450,000]. Both the $100,000 and the 22% are useful pieces of information. When you look at TBL’s industry data, and you compare other similar companies, the $100,000 decline may be useful, but the 22% may be a more relevant comparison, as companies within an industry can vary in size. If one company has $25 million in revenue and another has $5 million in revenue, the 22% figure provides a more useful comparison than the $100,000.

Accounting Impact on Balance Sheet–based, Income Statement–based and Statement of Cash Flows–based Ratios
Ratio analysis based on the study of financial statement data can be an extremely powerful decision-making tool. When properly utilized, ratio data can help in making decisions based on both past and present information. The information and knowledge gained about a company can help in making decisions that assist the company now and in the future.

In order for ratio analysis to be useful, it is key that the data utilized in the ratios be correct and understood. In this section, we will explain how a strong understanding of financial statement components can enhance your usage of ratio analysis results. More clearly stated, if you understand the financial statements from which you retrieve your data, you will have a better overall understanding of the ratio information you are working with.

For our balance sheet discussion, we will utilize the current ratio, a liquidity ratio. For our income statement discussion, we will utilize gross margin, which measures profitability. For our statement of cash flows discussion, we will utilize the cash flow solvency ratio, which measures solvency. Finally, we will briefly discuss the DuPont formula, which will tie a few concepts together.

EXHIBIT 0.15.1 Key Accounting and Finance Ratio


Current Ratio
In your finance role, you will utilize the data provided by accountants. The current ratio is a commonly used balance sheet ratio that measures a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations and tells financial statement users if a company can utilize its current assets to satisfy its current payables. As seen in Exhibit 0.15.1, it is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. As a financial analyst, you will utilize this formula often to consider the liquidity of a company. Accountants will be behind the scenes working with company accounting and information systems to make sure that each account balance on the financial statements is fairly and reasonably stated. As with net worth, which you previously learned about, it is very helpful to understand what is meant by current assets and current liabilities when utilizing the current ratio. As you work with these calculations, it is important that you remember that current assets are comprised of asset accounts such as prepaids and short-term investments receivables. If you accidentally include long-term assets such as property, plant, and equipment in your calculations, the ratio you are using to make decisions will be incorrect. You must look at current liabilities the same way. Current liabilities consist of accounts such as accounts payable and short-term notes payable various accrued obligations If you inadvertently included long-term notes payable in the calculation, your final ratio calculation will be incorrect. A solid understanding of the balance sheet is critical to proper usage of the current ratio.

Gross Margin
Gross margin is a commonly used profitability ratio. As seen in reference the exhibit number, it is calculated by taking Sales revenues minus cost of goods sold and dividing the result by Sales revenues. Total sales revenues minus cost of goods sold gives you the amount of profit generated from the sale of products or providing services before considering the other types of expenses and support costs, such as selling and administrative expenses, and interest expenses. The sales revenue used in this calculation is the revenue from sale of the actual product. Revenue such as interest revenue and gains on sale of assets are not part of gross margin. The cost of goods sold is the production cost of the goods sold by the company, including costs such as direct material and direct labor. Costs such as interest expense and loss on sale of assets are not included in the cost of goods sold Gross margin is a ratio commonly used in the financial world by accountants, investors, and analysts alike. Understanding the meaning behind it is crucial. It is important when you are working with gross margin that you understand what part of profitability you are looking at; you are looking at the profit made from the actual “sale of the shoe,” for example. You are not looking at the profit after all costs have been considered. Beyond gross margin, you must consider selling and administrative and other types of expenses and revenues.

Cash Flow Solvency Ratio
The cash flow solvency ratio is a commonly used solvency ratio. It is calculated by dividing total cash flows from operations by total liabilities. It measures the company’s ability to pay its debts with its current cash flow. Relative to its industry, a company hopes to have a high cash flow solvency ratio. This ratio requires that, once again, you understand liabilities as presented on the balance sheet. It also requires that you understand cash used or provided by operations in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. Once you have gained a better understanding of the statement of cash flows, making sense of this ratio will be much easier. We have seen that, in order to be successful in the long run, a company must generate cash from the operations of its business, as opposed to cash provided by investing or financing activities. This ratio shows whether cash provided by performing the company’s actual business function is sufficient, or not to pay off the company’s debts.

DuPont Formula
The DuPont formula helps companies analyze their return on equity (ROE). It helps investors understand how efficiently the money they have invested is being managed by the company. The formula gives companies a more meaningful understanding of their ROE by focusing on three basic parts. As seen in Exhibit 0.15.1, the three parts are profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. The DuPont formula requires that you understand components of both the balance sheet and the income statement. The amount of total assets from the balance sheet are used to calculate return on assets. amounts of total assets and total equity from the balance sheet are used to calculate financial leverage. Net profit and sales amounts from the income statement are used to calculate the net profit margin, and sales revenue is used to calculate the return on assets. When looking at return on equity in it most simple form, net profit divided by equity, both the income statement and the balance sheet must be utilized to determine net profit and equity balances. This formula shows you how components of each financial statement work together to give meaning to ratio analysis.

Each of the formulas discussed above is widely used in both accounting and finance. As you become more knowledgable in your understanding of the basic financial statements, calculating and interpreting the results of these ratios will become easier and more meaningful. Consider the ratios and think about what each of the components represent. You will find it much more meaningful to discuss the current ratio when you feel confident you understand what is meant by current assets and current liabilities. You will be much more comfortable discussing company margins when you have a more solid understanding of what the amounts generated by the calculation represent. With the cash flow solvency ratio and the return on equity ratio, the same is true. Once you understand the meanings behind the components from the financial statements, the calculation results will be more useful in your decision-making process.

Summarize the Relationship between Accounting and Finance
Sections 0.11–0.15 of Chapter 0 were designed to give you a basic, yet solid overview of accounting. Accounting knowledge can prove useful throughout your career in finance. Financial analysts have stronger skillsets if they have a solid understanding of how accounting works. Understanding the big picture of how the accounting cycle and adjusting entries work and understanding in what ways the financial statements are useful is a critical part of an analyst’s career. In finance, much of your time and effort will be spent working with key financial ratios. Understanding the accounting origins of those components can help you better understand the ratios you are working with as a whole. Accountants work hard to provide information to decision makers in many ways. A basic understanding of how an accounting cycle works and how the financial statements can be useful is critical to your long-term success throughout your career in finance.
