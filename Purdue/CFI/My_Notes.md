Hi Chris,

	It is true that financial leverage or debt financing could be really beneficial if used correctly, how ever it also come with some tradeoff. Highly leverage practive of debt could increase the risk and restricting the available cash flow for the future. Your example of the AST SpaceMobile financial situation to demonstrate the important of using debt financing as leverage. As you have pointed out this company have a leverage ratio of 0.7 and require a significant boost in sale or revenue to meet its upcoming financial challegnes. If cash reserves are depleted and refinancing is not possible, the company may face insolvency or bankruptcy.
	In conclusion some level of debt financing could provide some benefits as long as it is within check and not over leverage to put the company at risk.	
	
Thanks
