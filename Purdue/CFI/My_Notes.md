Hi Samuel,

	I strongly agree with you, ERM is a comprehensive and organized way to managed risk to ensure that the firm's assets, the decision-making process from derailing the firms establish objective or mission. It also correct that level of risk varies due to  the differeces in operational and fincial structure of the firms.
