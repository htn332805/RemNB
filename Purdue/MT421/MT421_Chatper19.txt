Chapter 19Retirement Planning

Vince has earned a very good income for the last 25 years. He devised a retirement plan when he first began his career that was intended to let him retire by age 50. Vince decided to only contribute about $200 per month ($2,400 per year) to the retirement account established for him by his employer. He wanted to use a large portion of each paycheck on individual stocks separate from his retirement account, because these investments were not available within his retirement account. This strategy backfired because he always spent most of his income rather than setting any money aside for investments.

For the limited contributions that Vince made to his retirement account, he selected one particular international stock mutual fund as his only investment. While that international stock fund had the potential for high growth, it was also very risky. Over the years, it performed poorly.

Vince is now 48 years old, but he only has about $120,000 in his retirement account. Therefore, he will need to work many more years to be financially secure. If he had set aside the maximum amount that he was allowed to contribute to his retirement account over the last 25 years and invested his retirement fund money in a more conservative stock mutual fund, he probably could have retired at age 50.

If you begin early in your working years to contribute to a retirement plan, you can avoid the situation experienced by Vince. The size of your retirement savings by the time you retire will depend largely on your own retirement planning decisions. This chapter describes the retirement planning process that can make you financially secure.

Social Security
Recall from Chapter 4 that Social Security is a federal program that taxes you during your working years and uses the funds to make payments to you on retirement (subject to age and other requirements). It is intended to ensure that you receive some income once you retire and therefore is an important part of retirement planning. However, Social Security does not provide sufficient income to support the lifestyle of most individuals. The average benefit for those who qualify and are receiving benefits is about $1,700 per month, or $20,400 per year. Therefore, additional retirement planning is necessary to ensure that you can live comfortably when you retire.

Qualifying for Social Security
To qualify for Social Security benefits, you need to build up a total of 40 credits from contributing to Social Security over time through payroll taxes. You can earn four credits per year if your income is at least $1,640 per quarter. In addition to receiving income at retirement, you will also receive Social Security benefits if you become disabled, as discussed in Chapter 4, or if you are the survivor when a breadwinner of the household dies.

Retirement Benefits
The amount of income that you receive from Social Security when you retire depends on the number of years you earned income and your average level of income. Social Security replaces about 40% of a worker’s average annual income from their working years. However, this proportion is higher for individuals who had low income levels and lower for those who had high income levels.

You can receive retirement benefits starting at age 62, but the benefits will be lower than if you wait until you reach full retirement age. As a general rule, though, early retirement will give you about the same total Social Security benefits over your lifetime as full retirement benefits. Full retirement benefits begin at age 65 (for those born before 1938) to 67 (for those born in 1960 and later), depending on what year you were born (the age for qualification gradually increases over time). If you can wait until you are 70 to receive benefits, you will receive an even larger amount.

You can earn other income while receiving Social Security benefits. If you have not reached full retirement age, however, and your income from your job exceeds a specified limit ($21,240 in 2023), your Social Security benefits may be taxed. You can obtain an estimate of your retirement benefits at www.ssa.gov.

Social Security Benefits in the Future
There is some concern about whether full Social Security benefits will be available for retirees in the future. Today’s retirees are living longer, which means that the program must provide income over a longer period to individuals on average. In addition, there will be more retirees in the future and fewer workers to support them. Therefore, given the program’s uncertain future, many individuals are relying less on Social Security income in their retirement planning.

Even if the Social Security program continues, you may want more income after retirement than it provides. Many individuals accumulate their own retirement assets either through an employer-sponsored retirement plan or by establishing an individual retirement account (IRA).

Defined-Benefit versus Defined-Contribution Plans
Employer-sponsored retirement plans are designed to help you save for retirement. Each pay period, you and/or your employer contribute money to a retirement account. The money in most of these accounts can be invested in a manner that you specify (within the range of options offered by your specific plan). The money you contribute to the retirement plan is not taxed until you withdraw it from the account. If you withdraw money from the account before you reach age 
5

,
 you will be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty tax. Any money you withdraw from the retirement account after you retire is taxed as ordinary income.

Employer-sponsored retirement plans are classified as defined-benefit or defined-contribution plans.

Defined-Benefit Plans
Defined-benefit plans guarantee a specific amount of income when you retire, based on factors such as your salary and years of employment. Your employer makes all the contributions to the plan. The specific formula varies among employers. Guidelines also determine when employees are vested, which means that they have a claim to a portion of the retirement money that has been reserved for them on retirement. For example, a firm may allow you to be 20% vested after two years, which means that 20% of the amount reserved for you through employer contributions will be maintained in your retirement account even if you leave the company. The percentage increases with the number of years with the employer, so you may be fully vested (able to retain 100% of your retirement account) after six years based on the guidelines of some retirement plans. Once you are fully vested, all money that is reserved for you each year will be maintained in your retirement account. These vesting rules encourage employees to stay at one firm for several years.

Having a claim to a portion of the money in an employer-sponsored retirement account that has been reserved for you on your retirement even if you leave the company.

One major advantage of a defined-benefit plan is that the benefits accumulate without the initiation of the employees. This helps employees who would not save money for retirement if they were given the money in the form of a salary. Therefore, it ensures that people save for their retirement.

The number of companies offering defined-benefit plans has declined dramatically in recent decades. In the late 1990s, the majority of private-sector retirement plans were defined-benefit plans, but today less than 10% of companies offer a defined-benefit plan. These plans are still common in the public sector, however. More than 80% of state and local government workers are covered by defined-benefit plans.

Defined-Contribution Plans
Defined-contribution plans specify guidelines under which you and/or your employer can contribute to your retirement account. The benefits that you ultimately receive are determined by the performance of the money invested in your account. You can decide how you want the money to be invested. You can also change your investments over time.

defined-contribution plan
An employer-sponsored retirement plan that specifies guidelines under which you and/or your employer can contribute to your retirement account and that allows you to invest the funds as you wish.

As a result of their flexibility, defined-contribution plans have become very popular, and many employers have shifted from defined-benefit to defined-contribution plans. This places more responsibility on the employees to contribute money and to decide how the contributions should be invested until their retirement. Therefore, you need to understand the potential benefits of a defined-contribution plan and how to estimate the potential retirement savings that can be accumulated under this plan.

The Decision to Contribute
PSYCHOLOGY of Personal Finance

Some people who have defined-contribution plans make the mistake of waiting too long to save for retirement. They do not worry about saving for retirement when they are younger because they believe that they can save later. With this rationale, they may spend all the money that they earn. Then, as they get older, they may be forced to catch up on investing for retirement, but doing that severely cuts into the funds they have available for spending. As a result, they might not save enough to have a comfortable retirement. The flexibility to postpone saving for retirement is one disadvantage of a defined-contribution plan for those people who don’t consider saving on their own.

Advantages of a Defined-Contribution Plan
A defined-contribution plan has many advantages. Any money contributed by your employer is like extra income paid to you beyond your salary. In addition, having a retirement account can encourage you to save money each pay period by directing a portion of your income to be automatically added to the account before you receive your paycheck.

Investing in a defined-contribution plan also offers tax benefits. The retirement account allows you to defer taxes on income paid by your employer because your contribution to your account is deducted from your pay before taxes are taken out. If you invest $5,000 per year in your retirement account, you can reduce your taxable income by $5,000 each year, which reduces your taxes. If your marginal tax bracket is 24%, you could reduce your income tax by $1,200 (computed as 
24
%

$

).

Also, note that the income generated by your investments in a retirement account is not taxed until you withdraw the money after you retire. This tax benefit is valuable because it provides you with more money that can be invested and accumulate in value. In addition, by the time you are taxed on the investments (when you withdraw funds from your retirement account), you will likely be in a lower tax bracket because you will have less taxable income.

Investment Decisions within Your Retirement Account
Most defined-contribution plans sponsored by employers allow some flexibility in how your retirement funds can be invested. You can typically select from a variety of stock mutual funds, bond mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or even money market funds. The amount of funds you accumulate in your retirement account will depend on how your investment in the retirement account performs.
Types of Defined-Contribution Retirement Plans Offered by Employers
Many large companies and some government agencies offer their employees a defined-contribution retirement plan, and there are also plans available for small businesses. The more popular defined-contribution retirement plans are described here.

401(k) Plans
A 401(k) plan is a plan established by firms for their employees. Federal guidelines establish the maximum amount that employees can contribute per year ($22,500 in 2023 and an additional $7,500 if the employee is age 50 or older). The money you contribute is deducted from your paycheck before taxes are assessed. Your 401(k) contributions are fully vested regardless of when you leave the firm.

401(k) plan
A defined-contribution plan that allows employees to contribute up to a set maximum amount each year on a pretax basis.

Employers offer a set of investment alternatives for the money contributed to a 401(k). For example, you may be able to invest in one or more mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The funds are not necessarily part of a single family, so you may be able to choose among funds sponsored by many different investment companies.

Some firms allow a managed account in which an adviser provides you with investment advice and asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Each company relies on a different program, so the prescribed allocation could depend on the company that manages your 401(k) plan. There are advisory fees, which normally range from 0.2% to 0.8% or higher per year. The company is required to disclose the amount of all fees, the historical performance of the investments available in the plan, the plan’s objectives, and its strategies. The required disclosures are similar to those that mutual funds must make.

Matching Contributions by Employers
Some 401(k) plans require the entire contribution to come from the employee with no matching contribution from the employer. Other employers match the employee’s contribution. In a dollar-for-dollar match, the employer matches the entire employee contribution up to the company’s limit. So, for example, if an employee contributes $400 per month, the employer will provide an additional $400 per month to the employee’s retirement account. Or the firm may match a percentage of the employee’s contribution. For example, if the employee contributes $400, the employer may contribute 50% of that amount, or an additional $200. The amount of matching (if any) provided by the employer has a large impact on the savings that the employee will accumulate by retirement. Most employers offering 401(k) plans match at least a portion of an employee’s contributions.

Tax on Money Withdrawn from a 401(k) Account
If you withdraw money from your 401(k) account before age 
59

 you will be subject to a penalty equal to 10% of the amount withdrawn. The amount you withdraw will also be taxed as regular income at your marginal income tax rate. However, if you are retired and over age 
59

2
 when you withdraw the money, you may not have much other taxable income and therefore will be in a very low marginal income tax bracket. Thus, the 401(k) plan allows you to defer paying taxes on the income you contributed for several years and may also allow you to pay a lower tax rate on the money once you withdraw it.

Roth 401(k) Plans
Some companies offer a Roth 401(k) plan as an alternative to the traditional 401(k) retirement plan by participating companies. Income contributed to a Roth 401(k) is taxed at the contributor’s marginal tax rate at the time of the contribution. The advantage of a Roth 401(k) is that funds are not taxed when they are withdrawn from the account, as they are when withdrawn from a traditional 401(k) account. In essence, the Roth 401(k) plan allows contributors to avoid paying taxes on the interest or capital gains generated by the account.

The decision to invest in a Roth 401(k) or traditional account may depend on your marginal tax rate today versus your expected tax rate when you withdraw funds after retirement. If you are currently in a very low marginal tax bracket, you may benefit from using the Roth 401(k) because the taxes on your contribution will be small, and you will not be taxed on the funds at withdrawal. However, many people may prefer the traditional 401(k) because the tax benefit occurs while they are earning an income from their employer; at this time, they may be subject to a higher marginal tax rate, compared to their rate when they will be making withdrawals from the retirement account.

403(b) Plans
Nonprofit organizations such as educational institutions and charitable organizations offer 403(b) plans, which are very similar to 401(k) plans in that they allow you to invest a portion of your income on a tax-deferred basis. The maximum amount that you can contribute depends on your compensation and years of service, up to a limit of $22,500.
403(b) plan
A defined-contribution plan that allows employees of nonprofit organizations to invest up to a set maximum amount of their income on a tax-deferred basis.

A 403(b) plan allows you to choose investment alternatives. You will be penalized for withdrawals before age

 and when you withdraw the money at retirement, you will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates.

Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) Plans
A Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan is commonly set up by business owners for themselves and their employees. The employee is not allowed to make contributions. The employer can contribute up to 25% of the employee’s annual income, up to a maximum annual contribution of $66,000 in 2023. SEPs give an employer a lot of flexibility in determining how much money to contribute. The employer may establish your SEP account at an investment company, depository institution, or brokerage firm of your choice. If it is established at an investment company, you will be able to invest the money in a set of mutual funds that the company offers. If the account is established at a depository institution, you will be able to invest the money in certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by the institution. If it is established at a brokerage firm, you may be able to invest in some individual stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs that you choose. Withdrawals should occur only after age

 to avoid a penalty, and the withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax rates at that time.

SIMPLEs
SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) is intended for firms with 100 or fewer employees. A SIMPLE plan can be established at investment companies, depository institutions, or brokerage firms. In 2023, an employee could contribute up to $15,500 (additional contributions of $3,500 are allowed for employees who are age 50 or older). This contribution is not taxed until the money is withdrawn from the account. Thus, a SIMPLE account is an effective means of deferring tax on income. In addition, the employer can match a portion of the employee’s contribution.

A defined-contribution plan intended for firms with 100 or fewer employees.

Profit Sharing
Some firms provide profit sharing, in which the employer makes contributions to employee retirement accounts based on a specified profit formula. The employer can contribute up to 25% of an employee’s salary each year, up to a maximum annual amount of $66,000 in 2023.

A defined-contribution plan in which the employer makes contributions to employee retirement accounts based on a specified profit formula.

Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)
With an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), the employer contributes some of its own stock to the employee’s retirement account. A disadvantage of this plan is that it is focused on one stock; if this stock performs poorly, your retirement account will not be able to support your retirement. An ESOP is generally riskier than retirement plans invested in diversified funds.

A retirement plan in which the employer contributes some of its own stock to the employee’s retirement account.

Keogh Plans
One of the first retirement plans created for self-employed individuals is the Keogh plan (pronounced “KEE-oh”), named after the congressman who sponsored the bill creating it. However, Keogh plans are rarely used today because their rules are complicated and the plans are difficult to set up. Nevertheless, they still are used by certain high-income, self-employed individuals. As with other retirement accounts, contributions are not taxed until they are withdrawn at the time of retirement.

A retirement plan that enables high-income, self-employed individuals to contribute part of their pretax income to a retirement account.

Managing Your Retirement Account After Leaving Your Employer
When you leave an employer, you may be able to retain your retirement account there if you have at least $5,000 in it. Another option is to transfer your assets tax-free into your new employer’s retirement account, assuming that your new employer allows such transfers (most employers do). However, some employers charge high annual fees to manage transferred retirement plans.

You can also create a rollover IRA by transferring your assets tax-free from your company retirement plan into an IRA. You can initiate a rollover IRA by completing an application provided by various investment companies that sponsor mutual funds or by various brokerage firms. By transferring your retirement account into a rollover IRA, you can avoid cashing in your retirement account and therefore can continue to defer taxes and avoid the early withdrawal penalty. To avoid taxes on a rollover IRA, you must comply with a number of stringent rules, so be sure to check the rules before initiating a rollover.

An individual retirement account (IRA) into which you can transfer the assets from your company retirement plan tax-free while avoiding early withdrawal penalties.
Individual Retirement Accounts
Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) allow individuals to set up retirement accounts for themselves without the involvement of an employer. Thus, they are very popular among self-employed individuals. There are two main types of IRAs: the traditional IRA and the Roth IRA.

Traditional IRAs
The traditional IRA enables you to save for your retirement separate from any retirement plan provided by your employer. An IRA allows you to invest up to a set amount each year ($6,500 for an individual in 2023) and receive a tax deduction on your contribution. Individuals who are age 50 or older can make additional contributions of $1,000 per year. However, there are restrictions for individuals who have income above specified levels or who are covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans.

traditional individual retirement account (IRA)
A retirement plan that enables individuals to invest a set amount up to a maximum each year and receive a tax deduction if they meet certain income and other requirements; income earned in the plan is not taxed until it is withdrawn.

When you contribute to an IRA, your investment choices will depend on the retirement plan sponsor. Many sponsors allow a wide range of mutual funds and ETFs. You can withdraw funds from an IRA without penalty at age 
59

 or later. You are taxed on the income earned by your investments at your ordinary income tax rate at the time you withdraw funds. If you withdraw the funds before age 
59

 you are not only taxed at your ordinary income tax rate but also typically charged a penalty equal to 10% of the withdrawn funds.

Roth IRAs
The Roth IRA is an alternative to the traditional IRA, whereby the money invested is taxed at the time of the contribution, but your withdrawals are not taxed, as long as you withdraw the money after age 
59
1

 and your Roth IRA has been in existence for at least five years. Thus, the main difference between Roth and traditional IRAs is that the Roth IRA is taxed at the time funds are invested in the retirement account, while the traditional IRA is taxed when funds are withdrawn from the account. The Roth IRA contribution limits are similar to those of the traditional IRA. To review the specific limits, go to the Internal Revenue Service website (www.irs.gov) and use the website search engine to search IRA contribution limits.

Roth IRA
A retirement plan that enables individuals who are under specific income limits to invest after-tax income up to a set maximum each year; income earned in the plan is not taxed, and withdrawals are also tax-free.
Annuities
When conducting your retirement planning, you should also consider investing in annuities. An annuity is a financial contract that provides annual payments until a specified year or for one’s lifetime. This definition differs from the use of the term annuity elsewhere in this textbook in that it represents a specific financial contract sold by financial institutions. The minimum investment in an annuity is usually $5,000. The investment in an annuity is not sheltered from income taxes. Thus, if you invest $5,000 in an annuity, you cannot reduce your taxable income by $5,000. The return on the investment in an annuity is tax-deferred, however, so any gains generated by the annuity are not taxed until the funds are paid to the investor. Although there are benefits from being able to defer the tax on your investment, they are smaller than the benefits from sheltering income by using a retirement account. Therefore, annuities are not suitable substitutes for retirement plans.

annuity
A financial contract that provides annual payments over a specified period.

Fixed versus Variable Annuities
Annuities are classified as fixed or variable. Fixed annuities provide a specified return on your investment, so you know exactly how much money you will receive at a future point in time. Variable annuities allow you to allocate your investment among various subaccounts (specific stock and bond portfolios), so the return depends on the performance of those investments. You may periodically change your allocation. You can withdraw your investment as a lump sum or as a series of payments over time.

fixed annuity
An annuity that provides a specified return on your investment, so you know exactly how much money you will receive at a future point in time (such as retirement).

variable annuity
An annuity in which the return is based on the performance of the selected investment vehicles.

Variable annuities commonly provide a death benefit, so that when you die, your heirs receive the account balance or the amount that you initially invested in the annuity, whichever is greater. In most cases, the value of your investments should increase over time, so the guarantee that your heirs will receive the amount that you initially invested is not extremely beneficial. Furthermore, the company that sells you the annuity charges you for this death benefit, and the amount that it charges is typically much more than the expected benefit.

Annuity Fees
The main disadvantage of annuities is the high fees charged by the financial institutions (primarily insurance companies) that sell and manage annuities. These fees include management fees that are charged every year (similar to those for a mutual fund) and a surrender charge that may be imposed on any money withdrawn in the first eight years or so. The surrender charge is intended to discourage withdrawals. Some annuities allow you to swap one type of annuity for another, but when you do, you are typically charged surrender fees. The surrender charges are especially high if you withdraw money shortly after you purchase the annuity, and they decline over time.

surrender charge
A fee that may be imposed on any money withdrawn from an annuity.

In addition, there may be “insurance fees” that are essentially commissions to salespeople for selling the annuities to you. These commissions commonly range from 5.75% to 8.25% of your investment. Some insurance companies have been criticized because their brokers aggressively sold annuities to customers without concern for the needs of their customers. Because brokers earn commissions on how much they sell, they may be tempted to make a sale without fully disclosing the disadvantages of annuities.

Some financial institutions now offer no-load annuities that do not charge commissions and also charge relatively low management fees. For example, Fidelity and Vanguard offer annuities with relatively low annual expenses.
Your Retirement Planning Decisions
Many individuals who have a defined-contribution plan do not invest in their retirement accounts in their early years, and therefore they do not take full advantage of the tax savings provided by retirement accounts. One reason for not saving for retirement is that the payoff comes so far in the future. When you’re 25 years old, retirement is a long time away, and you may prefer to spend your money today in a way that will provide immediate satisfaction. The problem with that approach is that if you don’t start saving for retirement early, you will have to save more in the years leading up to your retirement.

Your key retirement planning decisions involve choosing a retirement plan, determining how much to contribute, and allocating your contributions. Several websites including www.aarp.org, www.bankrate.com, and www.marketwatch.com provide useful calculators to help you make these decisions. Using the calculators can help you understand the trade-offs involved so that you can make retirement planning decisions that fit your specific needs. Each of your retirement planning decisions is discussed next.

Guidance on your retirement decisions.

One of the most important retirement planning decisions is how much to contribute each pay period, as this decision will influence the amount of funds you have to spend during your retirement. The amount of funds you plan to spend during your retirement may influence your decision on how much you should contribute to retirement. Financial advisers often suggest that as a rule of thumb, you will need 70% to 80% of your pre-retirement salary to cover your annual expenses during retirement. An alternative rule of thumb is that your savings should be at least 10 to 12 times your pre-retirement salary, so a person earning $70,000 at retirement would need $700,000 to $840,000. However, a person who is planning on an inexpensive lifestyle would likely be able to live comfortably on less. Many investment companies such as Fidelity and Vanguard provide retirement budget worksheets on their websites, which can help you estimate the expenses that you might incur during retirement.

A large retirement expense that is often overlooked is the cost of health care. Although you will qualify for Medicare at age 65, you will still have health care expenses. You will have to pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part B (about $170 per month in 2023 for most people) and for Part D drug coverage, which will be deducted from your Social Security benefits, and you will also need Medicare Supplemental Insurance. Over many years of retirement, these costs are significant. Assuming that a couple will live to their mid-80s, they might pay a total of $250,000 or more for health insurance premiums and other health care expenses during retirement.

Given the difficulty of estimating how much income you will need at retirement, a safe approach is to recognize that Social Security will not provide sufficient funds and to invest as much as is allowed on a consistent basis in your retirement plan, especially when your contribution is matched by your employer. Alternatively, you can assess how much you need to cover your typical expenses and liquidity needs and invest the remainder in retirement accounts. The size of your contribution should increase as your salary increases. If you tend to spend whatever excess funds you have after covering all your obligations, consider retirement contributions to be an obligation. As you notice your retirement account accumulating funds, the saving process will become easier because you will notice how your retirement account balance grows over time.

How Should You Invest Your Contributions?
All the money you withdraw from your retirement account at the time you retire will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, regardless of how it was earned. Most financial advisers suggest a diversified set of investments, such as investing most of the money in one or more stock mutual funds or ETFs and investing the remainder in one or more bond mutual funds.

Your retirement plan investment decision should take into account the number of years until your retirement, as shown in Exhibit 19.1. If you are young and far from retirement, you are in a position to take more risks with your investments. Consider mutual funds and ETFs that invest in stocks with a high potential for growth (such as a capital appreciation fund, a technology fund, and maybe an international stock or bond fund).
Exhibit 19.1 Typical Composition of a Retirement Account Portfolio

Figure 19.1 Full Alternative Text
As you approach retirement, your investments should become more conservative. You might consider Treasury bond funds and a stock fund that focuses on stocks of very large firms that pay high dividends. Some investments (such as a money market fund focused on U.S. Treasury bills or bank CDs) are less risky but also offer less potential return. Most retirement plans allow a wide variety of investment alternatives to suit various risk tolerances.

The amount that you try to save by the time you retire partially depends on the retirement income that you will need to live comfortably. There are various methods of determining the amount that you should save for your retirement. Among the important variables to consider are the levels of your existing assets and liabilities, whether you will be supporting anyone besides yourself at retirement, your personal needs, the expected price level of products at the time of your retirement, and the number of years you expect to live while retired. If you plan to travel extensively, you may need nearly as much annual income as you needed during your working years. Various online calculators are available that can provide estimates based on your input.

Some individuals focus too heavily on risky investments in their retirement account because they get a psychological boost from investments that have the potential to generate very high returns. However, these investments could cause very large losses. Some investors end up gambling their retirement money on risky investments and possibly risking major losses that they cannot afford. Consequently, some retirees’ accounts may lack sufficient funds to support their retirement, which might force them to work additional years.
Retirement Planning Analysis
The amount of your accumulated retirement savings at the time you retire is highly dependent on your retirement decisions: (1) how much you contribute to your retirement account each year and (2) how you invest the money in your retirement account, which affects the rate of return on your investments. If you plan to save a specified amount of money every year for retirement, you can easily estimate the value of your savings by the time you retire. Recall that a set of annual payments is called an annuity. The future value of an annuity can be computed by using the future value interest factor of an annuity

Example

Stephanie Spratt is considering whether she should start saving toward her retirement. Although her retirement is 40 years away, she wants to ensure that she can live comfortably on her retirement income. She decides to contribute $3,600 per year ($300 per month) to her retirement through her employer’s defined-contribution plan. Her employer will provide a partial matching contribution of $1,400 per year. Therefore, the total contribution to her retirement account will be $5,000 per year. As a result, Stephanie will have less spending money and will not have access to these savings until she retires in about 40 years. However, her annual contribution helps reduce her taxes now, because the money she contributes is not subject to income taxes until she withdraws it at retirement.

Stephanie wants to determine how much money she will have in her retirement account in 40 years based on the total contribution of $5,000 per year

Impact of Your Annual Contribution on Retirement Savings
Consider how the amount of your savings at retirement is affected by the size of your annual contribution to your retirement account each year. Based on the previous example for Stephanie Spratt, you could accumulate about $774,000 in your retirement account if you contribute $5,000 (at a 6% rate of return) to your retirement account every year. This level is shown in Exhibit 19.2 at $5,000 on the horizontal axis.

Exhibit 19.2 Relationship between Amount Saved per Year and Amount of Savings at Retirement (in 40 Years, Assuming a 6% Annual Return)

Figure 19.2 Full Alternative Text
However, notice from Exhibit 19.2 that if you could only contribute a total of $3,000 to your retirement account each year, you would accumulate about $464,000 in retirement savings in 40 years. Thus, you would give up more than $300,000 in retirement savings if you contribute $3,000 per year instead of $5,000 per year to your retirement account.

As a more favorable scenario, if you could contribute a total of $7,000 per year to your retirement account, you could accumulate more than $1,000,000 in retirement savings in 40 years. Even if you cannot contribute $7,000 per year, knowing the potential benefits of boosting your contribution might motivate you to increase your retirement contributions in the future when your income increases.

Impact of Savings Duration on Retirement Savings
The amount of retirement savings that you will accumulate by the time you retire also depends on the duration (number of years) over which you contribute to your retirement account. As Exhibit 19.3 shows, the longer your annual savings are invested, the greater will be your retirement savings. If you plan to retire at age 65, notice that if you start saving $5,000 per year at age 35 (and therefore save for 30 years until retirement), you will have about $395,000 at the time of your retirement (assuming a 6% annual return on investment). However, if you start saving $5,000 per year at age 25 (and therefore save for 40 years until retirement), you will have about $774,000 at the time of your retirement. This comparison should motivate you to start saving for retirement earlier in your career, because the ultimate reward (your retirement savings) is substantial.

Impact of Your Annual Return on Your Retirement Savings
The amount of your retirement savings also depends on the return that you earn on your investments in your retirement account, as shown in Exhibit 19.4. Recall that contributing $5,000 per year at a 6% rate of return over 40 years results in retirement savings of about $774,000, as is shown in Exhibit 19.4 (see the bar for 6% on the horizontal axis). Notice how the results change if the rate of return is worse than expected. A $5,000 retirement contribution per year at a 4% rate of return over 40 years would result in retirement savings of less than $500,000, which is almost $300,000 less than if the rate of return was 6%. This illustrates the importance of generating a decent rate of return on the investments in your retirement account.

Exhibit 19.4 Relationship between the Annual Return on Your Annual Savings and Your Savings at Retirement (in 40 Years, Assuming a $5,000 Annual Investment)

Figure 19.4 Full Alternative Text
Retirement savings is just as sensitive if the rate of return is higher than expected. A $5,000 retirement contribution per year for 40 years at 8% would result in retirement savings of almost $1.3 million, which represents more than $500,000 in extra retirement savings if the rate of return is just 2% higher than expected.

However, by pursuing more risky investments in order to achieve an 8% return, you could experience a low rate of return or even a loss (negative return) on your investments. Furthermore, if you overestimate the return that you will earn on your retirement account, you will overestimate the accumulated retirement savings that you will have by the time you are planning to retire, which might force you to continue working. Therefore, select the investments in your retirement account carefully, because those investments will determine the rate of return that you earn over time, which will influence the total retirement savings that you accumulate by the time that you retire.

Summary
ROLE OF SOCIAL SECURITY. Social Security provides income to qualified individuals to support them during their retirement. However, the income provided normally is not sufficient for most individuals to live comfortably. Therefore, individuals engage in retirement planning so that they will have additional sources of income when they retire.

DEFINED-BENEFIT VERSUS DEFINED-CONTRIBUTION PLANS. Retirement plans sponsored by employers are normally classified as defined-benefit plans or defined-contribution plans. Defined-benefit plans guarantee a specific amount of income to employees on retirement, based on factors such as their salary and number of years of service. Defined-contribution plans provide guidelines on the maximum amount that can be contributed to a retirement account. Individuals have the freedom to make decisions about how much to invest and how to invest for their retirement.

DEFINED-CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLANS OFFERED BY EMPLOYERS. Defined-contribution retirement plans offered by employers include the 401(k) plan, 403(b) plan, Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan, SIMPLE plan, profit sharing, and ESOP. These plans offer similar types of benefits in that they encourage you to save for retirement and can defer your income from taxes. The specific eligibility requirements and other characteristics vary among retirement plans.

INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. In addition to or instead of retirement accounts offered by employers, individuals can also establish an individual retirement account (IRA), such as a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.

ANNUITIES. An annuity is a financial contract that provides annual payments until a specified year or for one’s lifetime. The return on the investment in an annuity is tax-deferred, so any gains generated by the annuity are not taxed until the funds are paid to the investor. However, this tax benefit is smaller than the benefit from sheltering income by using a retirement account.

YOUR RETIREMENT PLANNING DECISIONS. One of the most important retirement planning decisions is how much of your periodic income to invest in retirement. Many people do not invest much money in their retirement account because they would prefer to spend the money immediately. This limits the amount of money that can be accumulated in the retirement account. A second important decision is how to invest the money in your retirement account. While risky investment strategies might build larger retirement savings, they could cause you to lose much of your retirement savings.

ESTIMATING THE FUTURE VALUE OF YOUR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. Your future savings from investing in a retirement account can easily be estimated based on information regarding the amount you plan to invest each year, the annual return you expect, and the number of years until retirement.

HOW RETIREMENT PLANNING FITS INTO YOUR FINANCIAL PLAN. While you are working, you should be setting aside funds for your retirement. This will allow you to spend more money once you have retired and have more time for leisure activities. Retirement planning at an early age can have a major impact on your wealth by the time you retire.
