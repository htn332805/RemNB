Description
Where does it all go? To some people, it seems like the last paycheck is gone before the next one comes in. They don’t believe that they are living extravagantly. Last month they made a pledge to themselves to spend less than the month before. Somehow, though, they are in the same position as they were last month: Their money is gone. Does this sound like you, or do you recognize this scenario?

What are your expenses? Many people are not aware of how much money they spend per month, or how the spending is allocated. Each expense may seem harmless, but combined they can quickly gobble up your income. What can you do to gain control of your personal finances?

In this chapter, you will learn how to take control of your finances. However, your task is not easy because it takes self-discipline, and there may be no immediate reward. The process can be easy to start, but hard to carry through.

Your tools are the personal balance statement, the personal cash flow statement, and a budget. These three tools show your present financial status, predict where you will be after three months or a year, and help you control expenses. The potential benefits are reduced spending, increased savings and investments, and peace of mind from knowing that you are in control.

The objectives of this chapter are to
Explain how to create your personal cash flow statement.

Identify the factors that affect your cash flows.

Describe how to forecast your cash flows.

Explain how to create your personal balance sheet.

Explain how budgeting influences your financial plan.
Personal Cash Flow Statement
As we mentioned in Chapter 1, budgeting is the process of forecasting future expenses and savings. When budgeting, the first step is to create a personal cash flow statement, which measures your cash inflows and cash outflows. Comparing your cash inflows and outflows allows you to monitor your spending and determine the amount of cash that you can allocate toward savings or other purposes.

Cash Inflows
The main source of cash inflows for working people is their salary, but there can be other important sources of income. Deposits in various types of savings accounts can generate cash inflows in the form of interest income. Some stocks also generate quarterly dividend income.

Cash Outflows
Cash outflows represent all your expenses, which are the result of your spending decisions. Expenses are both large (for example, monthly rent) and small (for example, dry cleaning costs). It is not necessary to document every expenditure, but you should track how most of your money is spent.

The easiest way to track your outflows is through an app on your smartphone, if you have one. Many apps are available, and new ones are constantly being introduced. These apps can track your income and your spending (even providing color-coded lists for different categories such as groceries, entertainment, and gasoline), enable you to set up a budget and send you an alert when your expenditures exceed the amount budgeted for a certain category, remind you to pay bills, allow you to track your bank and credit card balances and check your credit score, and show your progress in saving for a goal such as a vacation.

Some apps will send you a weekly summary showing your cash inflows and outflows for the week. Not all of these features are available on every app, but if you search for “spending recording apps” on the Internet, you can read reviews and select the best app for you. Of course, if you withdraw cash from an ATM to make purchases, the app will not be able to track the specific items that you purchase. But spending with credit or debit cards or smartphone pay systems linked to those cards will be tracked, as will any checks that you write. If you do not want to use a tracking app, you can use your bank account statements and credit card statements to identify how you spent your money. Software programs such as Quicken can be used to record and monitor cash outflows.

Creating a Personal Cash Flow Statement
You can create a personal cash flow statement by recording how you received cash and how you used cash for expenses over a given period.

Example

Maridav/Shutterstock
Stephanie Spratt tried to limit her spending in college but never created a personal cash flow statement. Now that she has begun her career and is earning a salary, she wants to monitor her spending on a monthly basis. She decides to create a personal cash flow statement for the last month.

Stephanie’s Monthly Cash Inflows
Stephanie’s disposable (after-tax) income is about $36,000 per year, or about $3,000 per month.

Then Stephanie considers other potential sources of cash inflows. She does not receive any dividend income from stocks, and she does not have any money deposited in an account that pays interest. Thus, her entire monthly cash inflows come from her paycheck. She inserts the monthly cash inflow of $3,000 at the top of her personal cash flow statement.

Stephanie’s Monthly Cash Outflows
Stephanie uses an app that documents how she spends her money each month, based on her purchases with checks and credit cards. Her household payments for the previous month were as follows:

$1,000 for rent (this is her share per month, as she shares the apartment with a friend)

$100 for a student loan payment

$50 for Internet

$100 for electricity and water

$50 for smartphone expenses

$300 for groceries

$100 for a health care plan provided by her employer

Next, Stephanie reviews her accounts to estimate her other typical monthly expenses:

About $100 for clothing

About $200 for car expenses (insurance, maintenance, and gas)

About $600 for recreation (including restaurants and a health club membership)

Stephanie uses this cash outflow information to complete her personal cash flow statement, as shown in Exhibit 2.1. Her total cash outflows were $2,600 last month.

Exhibit 2.1 Personal Cash Flow Statement for Stephanie Spratt

Stephanie’s Net Cash Flows
Monthly cash inflows and outflows can be compared by estimating net cash flows, which are equal to the cash inflows minus the cash outflows. Stephanie estimates her net cash flows to determine how easily she covers her expenses and how much excess cash she has to allocate to savings or other purposes. Her net cash flows during the last month were:
Stephanie enters this information at the bottom of her personal cash flow statement.

Cash inflows minus cash outflows.
Factors Affecting Cash Flows
To enhance your wealth, you want to maximize your (or your household’s) cash inflows and minimize cash outflows. Your cash inflows and outflows depend on various factors, as will be described next.

Factors Affecting Cash Inflows
Cash inflows are highly influenced by factors that affect your income level. The key factors to consider are the stage in your career path and your job skills.

Stage in Your Career Path
The stage you have reached in your career path influences cash inflows because it affects your income level. Cash inflows are relatively low for people who are in college or just starting a career (like Stephanie Spratt). They tend to increase as you gain job experience and progress within your chosen career.

Your career stage is closely related to your place in the life cycle. Younger people tend to be at early stages in their respective careers, whereas older adults tend to have more work experience and are thus farther along the career path. It follows that cash inflows tend to be lower for individuals in their 20s and much higher for individuals in their 50s.

There are many exceptions to this trend, however. Some older adults switch careers and therefore face a setback in their career path. Other people who switch careers from a low-demand industry to a high-demand industry may earn higher incomes. Many parents (especially women) put their careers on hold for several years to raise children and then resume their professional lives.

The final stage in the life cycle is retirement. The cash flows that come from a salary are discontinued at the time of retirement. After retirement, individuals rely on Social Security payments and interest or dividends earned on investments as sources of income. Consequently, retired individuals’ cash inflows tend to be smaller than when they were working. How age commonly affects cash inflows is summarized in Exhibit 2.2. Notice that there are three distinct phases.

Exhibit 2.2 How Your Cash Inflows Are Related to Your Age

Figure 2.2 Full Alternative Text
Type of Job
Income also varies by job type. Jobs that require specialized skills tend to pay much higher salaries than those that require skills that can be obtained quickly and easily. The income level associated with specific skills is also affected by the demand for those skills. For example, the demand for people with a nursing license has been high in recent years, so hospitals have been forced to pay high salaries to outbid other hospitals for nurses.

Number of Income Earners in Your Household
If you are the sole income earner, your household’s cash inflows will typically be lower than if there is a second income earner. Many households now have two income earners, which has substantially increased the cash flows to these households.

Factors Affecting Cash Outflows
The key factors that affect cash outflows are a person’s family status, age, and personal consumption behavior.
Family Size
A person who is supporting a family will normally incur more expenses than a single person without dependents. The more family members, the greater the amount of spending and the greater the cash outflows. Families with dependents have higher expenses for food and clothing, as well as for services such as day care, school tuition, home care aides, medical care, or medical equipment.

Age
As people get older, they tend to spend more money on houses, cars, and vacations. This adjustment in spending may result from the increase in their income (cash inflows) over time as they progress along their career path.

Personal Consumption Behavior
PSYCHOLOGY of Personal Finance

Most people’s consumption behavior is affected by their income. For example, a two-income household tends to spend more money when both income earners are working full-time. Yet people’s consumption behavior varies substantially. At one extreme are people who spend their entire paycheck within a few days of receiving it, regardless of the size of the paycheck. Although this behavior is understandable for people who have low incomes, it is also a common practice for some who have very high incomes.

Some people spend excessively to achieve immediate satisfaction, without any attempt to plan for their financial future. Their consumption may be intended to match that of what they consider to be their peer group; for example, they purchase a car or a home that is at least the same value as those of their peers. This behavior can lead to financial problems for individuals whose cash inflows are less than those of their peers, because they may not be able to afford their lifestyle. Alternatively, they may be attempting to match peers who are also living beyond their means. They (and perhaps even their peers) may need to constantly borrow to support their excessive consumption, which could ultimately result in credit problems.

You can assess your spending behavior by measuring the proportion of your cash outflows over a recent period (such as the last month) for each purpose. First, classify all your spending into categories such as car, rent, school expenses, clothing, and entertainment. Then determine the proportion of your cash outflows that are allocated toward each of these categories. If a very high percentage of your cash outflows are allocated toward your car, it might suggest that your car dictates your lifestyle, because it leaves very little money for you to spend on anything else. Determining the proportion of your income that is spent on each category will also allow you to assess where most of your money is spent.
Forecasting Your Cash Flows
The next step in the budgeting process is an extension of the personal cash flow statement. You can forecast net cash flows by forecasting the cash inflows and outflows for each item on the personal cash flow statement. A cash flow statement that is based on forecasted cash flows for a future time period is referred to as a budget. For example, you may develop a budget to determine whether your cash inflows will be sufficient to cover your cash outflows. If you expect your cash inflows to exceed your cash outflows, you can also use the budget to determine the amount of excess cash that you will have available to invest in additional assets or to make extra payments to reduce your personal debt.

Example

Stephanie Spratt wants to determine whether she will have sufficient cash inflows this month. She uses the personal cash flow statement she developed last month to forecast this month’s cash flows. However, she adjusts that statement for the following additional anticipated expenses:

Total health care expenses will be $400 this month ($300 more than normal) due to a minor procedure she had done recently that is not covered by her insurance.

Car maintenance expenses will be $500 this month ($300 more than normal), mainly due to a car repair.

Stephanie revises her personal cash flow statement from last month to reflect the expected changes this month, as shown in Exhibit 2.3. The numbers in brackets show the revised cash flows as a result of the unusual circumstances for this month.

The main effects of the unusual circumstances on Stephanie’s expected cash flows for this month are summarized in Exhibit 2.4. Notice that the expected cash outflows for this month are $3,200, or $600 higher than the cash outflows in a typical month. In this month, the expected net cash flows are as follows:
The budgeting process has alerted Stephanie to this expected $200 cash shortage. This allows Stephanie to plan for how she can cover the deficit.

Anticipating Cash Shortages
If you have a large amount of unexpected expenses in a particular month, your cash inflows may not be sufficient to cover your cash outflows. If the cash shortage is small, you would likely withdraw funds from your checking account to make up the difference. However, if you expect a major deficiency for a future month, you might not have sufficient funds available in your checking account. Your budget can warn you of such a problem well in advance so that you can determine how to cover the deficiency. Consider setting aside funds in a savings account that can serve as an emergency fund for use if you experience a cash shortage.

Tips on effective budgeting.

Unanticipated expenses can occur often because of various unexpected events such as a car repair. Because you may not always be able to predict an event that will cause your expenses to be higher than normal, you might consider budgeting for unanticipated expenses. You could include an amount such as $30 per month for unanticipated expenses, even though you do not know what the expenses will be. This may allow you to establish a more realistic budget, with more accurate estimates of how much money you will spend per month, and therefore more accurate estimates of how much you can save per month. Such a budgeting strategy might seem painful because it will result in smaller expected savings. But to the extent that it allows you to more accurately estimate your savings, it can help you achieve the savings goals that are set by your budget.

PSYCHOLOGY of Personal Finance

Assessing the Accuracy of the Budget
Periodically compare your actual cash flows over a recent period (such as the last month) to the forecasted cash flows in your budget to determine whether your forecasts are on target. Many individuals tend to be overly optimistic about their cash flow forecasts. They overestimate their cash inflows and underestimate their cash outflows; as a result, their net cash flows are lower than expected. By detecting such forecasting errors, you can take steps to improve your budgeting. You may decide to limit your spending to stay within your budgeted cash outflows, or you may choose not to adjust your spending habits, but to increase your forecast of cash outflows to reflect reality. By budgeting accurately, you are more likely to detect any future cash flow shortages and therefore can prepare for any deficiencies.

Forecasting Net Cash Flows over Several Months
To forecast your cash flows for several months ahead, you can follow the same process you used for forecasting one month ahead. Whenever particular types of cash flows are expected to be normal, they can be forecasted from previous months when the levels were normal. You can make adjustments to account for any cash flows that you expect to be unusual in a specific month in the future
Example

Maridav/Shutterstock

Recall that Stephanie Spratt forecasted cash flows to create a budget for the coming month. At the end of the month, she assesses whether her forecasts were accurate. Her forecasted cash flows are shown in the second column of Exhibit 2.5. She compares the actual cash flows (third column) to her forecast and calculates the difference between them (shown in the fourth column). This difference between columns two and three is referred to as the forecasting error.

Exhibit 2.5 Comparison of Stephanie Spratt’s Budgeted and Actual Cash Flows for This Month

Figure 2.5 Full Alternative Text
Reviewing the fourth column of Exhibit 2.5, Stephanie notices that total cash inflows were as expected, but total cash outflows were $100 more than expected. Her net cash flows were 
−
$
300
 (a deficiency of $300), which is worse than the expected level of 
−
$
200
.
 Stephanie assesses the individual cash outflows to determine where she underestimated them. Although grocery expenses were slightly lower than expected, her clothing and recreation expenses were higher than she anticipated. She decides that the expenses were abnormally high in this month only, so she believes that her budgeted cash flows should be reasonably accurate in most months.
Some types of expenses such as health care, car repairs, and household repairs often occur unexpectedly. Although such expenses are not always predictable, you should budget for them periodically. You should assume that you will likely incur some unexpected expenses for health care as well as for repairs on a car or household items over several months. Thus, your budget may not be perfectly accurate in any specific month, but it will be reasonably accurate over time. If you do not account for such possible expenses over time, you will likely experience lower net cash flows than expected over time.

Creating an Annual Budget
If you are curious about how much money you may be able to save in the next year, you can extend your budget for longer periods.

Example

Maridav/Shutterstock

Stephanie Spratt believes her budget for last month (except for the unusual health care and car expenses) is typical for her. She wants to extend it to forecast the amount of money that she might be able to save over the next year. Her cash inflows are predictable because she already knows her salary for the year. Some of the monthly cash outflows (such as rent and the Internet bill) in her monthly budget are also constant from one month to the next. To forecast these types of cash outflows, she simply multiplies the monthly amount by 12 (for each month of the year) to derive an estimate of the annual expenses, as shown in the third column of Exhibit 2.6.

Exhibit 2.6 Annual Budget for Stephanie Spratt

Figure 2.6 Full Alternative Text
Some other items vary from month to month, but Stephanie knows what the typical monthly cash outflow is for each item. She multiplies the typical monthly cash outflow by 12 to estimate cash outflows for the next 12 months. Over the next 12 months, Stephanie expects total cash outflows to be $31,200. Because she knows her total cash inflows (her disposable income) will be $36,000 over the year, she expects that her net cash flows will be $4,800 (computed as 
$
36,000
−
$
31,200
). Therefore, she sets a goal of saving $4,800 over the next year.
Improving the Budget
As time passes, review your budget to determine whether you are progressing toward the financial goals that you established. To increase your savings or pay down more debt so that you can more easily achieve your financial goals, identify the components within the budget that you can change to improve your budget over time.

Example

Maridav/Shutterstock

Recall that Stephanie Spratt expects to spend about $2,600 and save the remaining $400 each month. She would like to save a substantial amount of money so that she can purchase a new car and a home someday, so she considers how she might increase her net cash flows.

Stephanie reviews her budget’s summary of cash outflows to determine if she can reduce spending. Of the $2,600 that she spends per month, about $2,000 is spent on what she considers necessities (such as her rent and utilities). The remainder of the cash outflows (about $600) is spent on recreation; Stephanie realizes that any major reduction in spending will have to be in this category of cash outflows.

Most of her recreation spending is on her health club membership and eating at restaurants. She recognizes that she can scale back her spending while still enjoying these activities. Specifically, she realizes that her health club is overpriced. She can save about $60 per month by going to a different health club that offers essentially the same services. She also decides to reduce her spending at restaurants. By revising her spending behavior in these ways, she believes that she can reduce her cash outflows by $100 per month, as summarized here:

 	Previous Cash Flow	Planned Cash Flow
Monthly cash inflows	$3,000	$3,000
Monthly cash outflows	$2,600	$2,500
Monthly net cash flows	$400	$500
Yearly net cash flows	$4,800	$6,000
This reduction in spending will increase net cash flows from the present level of about $400 per month to a new level of $500 per month. If she can maintain this level of savings over a year, her net cash flows will now be $6,000, which would add to her savings. Although Stephanie had hoped to find a solution that would improve her personal cash flow statement more substantially, she believes this is a good start. Most importantly, her budget is realistic.

Personal Balance Sheet
The next step in the budgeting process is to create a personal balance sheet. A budget tracks your cash flows over a given period of time, whereas a personal balance sheet provides an overall snapshot of your wealth at a specific point in time. The personal balance sheet summarizes your assets (what you own), your liabilities (what you owe), and your net worth (assets minus liabilities).

Assets
The assets on a balance sheet can be classified as liquid assets, household assets, and investments.

Liquid Assets
Liquid assets are financial assets that can be easily sold without a loss in value. They are especially useful for covering upcoming expenses. Some of the more common liquid assets are cash, checking accounts, and savings accounts. These assets are viewed as safe, as their value does not decline over time.

liquid assets
Financial assets that can be easily sold without a loss in value.

Cash is handy to cover small purchases, and a checking account is convenient for larger purchases. Savings accounts are desirable because they pay interest on the money that is deposited. Thus, you can earn interest on your money in a savings account but can access that account if you need funds to cover a cash shortage. The management of liquid assets for covering day-to-day transactions is discussed in Part 2 of this text.

Household Assets
Household assets include items normally owned by a household, such as a home, car, and furniture. The financial planning involved in purchasing large household assets is discussed in Part 3 of this text. Household assets tend to make up a larger proportion of your total assets than the liquid assets.

household assets
Items normally owned by a household, such as a home, car, and furniture.

When creating a personal balance sheet, you need to assess the value of your household assets. The market value of an asset is the amount you would receive if you sold the asset today. For example, if you purchased a car last year for $20,000, the car may have a market value of $14,000 today, meaning that you could sell it to someone else for $14,000. The market values of cars can easily be obtained from various sources on the Internet, such as www.kbb.com (Kelley Blue Book). Establishing the precise market value of some assets, such as your house, may be difficult; for your house, you can use recent selling prices of other similar houses nearby to obtain a reasonable estimate.

Household assets are separated from liquid assets because you normally would not attempt to sell household assets such as a car or home for liquidity purposes. In general, the process of selling household assets is complicated because you may have to advertise what is for sale and then negotiate with a prospective buyer before selling these assets. So if you experience a temporary cash shortage of $300, accessing liquid assets such as a checking or savings account would be much easier than selling household assets.

Investments
Some of the more common investments are in bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and rental property.

Bonds are securities issued by borrowers (typically firms and government agencies) to raise funds. When you purchase a $1,000 bond that was just issued, you provide a $1,000 loan to the issuer of the bond. You earn interest while you hold the bond for a specified period. The value of a bond can rise or fall over time, as explained in more detail in Chapter 16.
bonds
Securities issued by borrowers to raise funds.

Stocks are securities representing partial ownership of a firm. Firms issue stock to obtain funding for various purposes, such as purchasing new machinery or building new facilities. Many firms have millions of shareholders who own shares of the firm’s stock.

stocks
Securities representing partial ownership of a firm.

The investors who purchase stock are referred to as shareholders, or stockholders. You may consider purchasing stocks if you have excess funds. You can sell some of your stock holdings when you need funds.

The market value of stocks changes daily, and the value of a stock can rise or fall over time, as explained in more detail in Chapter 15. You can find the current market value of a stock on many websites, including the finance section of www.Yahoo.com. Stock investors can earn a return on their investment if the stock’s value increases over time. They can also earn a return if the firm pays dividends to its shareholders.

Stocks are commonly viewed as a long-term investment and therefore are not used to cover day-to-day expenses.

NOTE: Your professor may assign you the “Selecting Your Investment” project, which is briefly described after all the exercises at the end of this chapter. The project can be found in Appendix B in the back of this textbook. If you are assigned this project, your only task at this point would be to select one stock that you would like to purchase, as explained at the beginning of the project in Appendix B.

Mutual funds sell shares to individuals and invest the proceeds in an overall portfolio of securities such as bonds or stocks. They are managed by portfolio managers who decide what securities to purchase so that the individual investors do not have to make the investment decisions themselves. The minimum investment varies depending on the particular fund, but it is usually between $500 and $3,000. The value of any mutual fund shares can be found in periodicals such as The Wall Street Journal or on various websites. The value of a mutual fund can rise or fall over time, as discussed in detail in Chapter 17.

mutual funds
Investment companies that sell shares to individuals and invest the proceeds in investment instruments such as bonds or stocks.

Real estate includes holdings in rental property and land. Rental property is housing or commercial property that is rented out to others. Some individuals purchase a second home and rent it out to generate additional income every year. Others purchase apartment complexes for the same reason. Some individuals purchase land as an investment.

rental property

Investments such as bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and real estate are normally not considered liquid assets because they can result in a loss in value if they have to be sold suddenly. So even if you own these types of investments, always maintain some liquid assets as well to cover any temporary shortages of cash.

Liabilities
Liabilities represent debt (what you owe) and can be divided into current liabilities and long-term liabilities.

Current Liabilities
Current liabilities are debts that you will pay off in the near future (within a year). The most common example of a current liability is a credit card balance that will be paid off in the near future. Credit card companies send the cardholder a monthly bill that itemizes all the purchases made in the previous month. If you pay your balance in full on receipt of the bill, no interest is charged on the balance. The liability is then eliminated until you receive the next monthly bill.

current liabilities
Debts that will be paid within a year.

Credit cards deserve special attention when discussing the personal budget. Although they offer a convenient source of funds, they also create serious credit problems for many people. Some people use credit cards to purchase products or services that they do not need and cannot afford. Two psychological forces cause this behavior. First, some people make unnecessary purchases with credit cards that they cannot afford to achieve immediate satisfaction and to keep up with their peers.

PSYCHOLOGY of Personal Finance

Second, some people are especially willing to spend excessively when using a credit card to make purchases because a credit card avoids the use of cash. That is, they would rather create a current liability (debt) than use an asset (cash) to make their purchases. They would feel more pain from using their cash and are more disciplined about how to spend the cash they have. They know that taking $50 out of their wallet to make a purchase will leave $50 less for other cash purchases. Yet when they use a credit card and keep their cash, they may feel like they can obtain products or services for free. Because the focus of their purchases is on achieving immediate satisfaction by making purchases they cannot afford, they ignore the fact that they will have to pay off the credit card in the future. This type of behavior tends to result in a large accumulation of current liabilities, which can result in credit problems.

Long-Term Liabilities
Long-term liabilities are debts that will be paid over a period beyond one year. A common long-term liability is a student loan, which is a debt that a student must pay back to a lender over time after graduation. This liability requires you to pay an interest expense periodically. Once you pay off this loan, you eliminate this liability and do not have to pay any more interest expenses. In general, you should limit your liabilities so that you can limit the amount of interest that you must pay (a cash outflow) to lenders every month.

long-term liabilities
Debts that will be paid over a period longer than one year.

Other common examples of long-term liabilities are car loans and mortgage (housing) loans. Car loans typically have a maturity of around five or six years, whereas mortgage loans typically have a maturity of fifteen or thirty years. Both types of loans can be paid off before their maturity date.

Net Worth
Your net worth is the difference between what you own and what you owe.

Net Worth
=
Value of Total Assets
−
Value of Total Liabilities
In other words, if you sold enough of your assets to pay off all of your liabilities, your net worth would be the amount of assets you would have remaining. Your net worth is a measure of your wealth because it represents what you own after deducting any money that you owe.

Some people tend to assess their financial wealth by reviewing their assets without considering their liabilities. Psychologically, they may feel the immediate satisfaction from their assets, but may not necessarily feel any immediate pain from their liabilities. This might even encourage them to make purchases that they cannot afford as long as they can obtain the credit.

PSYCHOLOGY of Personal Finance

To illustrate the point, consider a student who purchased a $20,000 car last month with borrowed funds. Because the market value of a car commonly declines by 20% as soon as the car is purchased (as explained in Chapter 9), assume the market value of the car is now about $16,000. The student’s liabilities equal $20,000. If the student has no other assets or liabilities, his net worth is estimated as:

Assets of
$
16,000
−
 Liabilities of
$
20,000
_
=
Net worth of 
−
$
 
4,000
Whenever assets are less than liabilities, net worth is negative. Many people who rely heavily on credit cards and do not pay off the balance each month have negative net worth, which means that they could not repay their debt even if they sold all of their assets. This situation can lead to bankruptcy.

Creating a Personal Balance Sheet
You should create a personal balance sheet to determine your net worth. Update it periodically to monitor how your wealth changes over time.

Stephanie’s Net Worth
Stephanie determines her net worth as the difference between her total assets and total liabilities. Notice from her personal balance sheet that her total assets are valued at $6,000, whereas her total liabilities are valued at $10,000. Thus, her net worth is:

Net Worth
=
Total Assets
−
Total Liabilities

Changes in the Personal Balance Sheet
If you earn new income this month but spend all of it on products or services such as rent, food, and concert tickets that are not personal assets, you will not increase your net worth. As you invest in assets, your personal balance sheet will change. In some cases, such as when you purchase a home, your assets increase while at the same time your liabilities may increase from taking on a mortgage loan to finance the home purchase. In any case, your net worth will not grow unless the increase in the value of your new assets exceeds the increase in your liabilities.

Example

Stephanie Spratt is considering purchasing a new car for $20,000. If she makes the purchase, Stephanie would do the following:

She would trade in her existing car, which has a market value of about $1,000.

She would write a check for $3,000 as a down payment on the car.

She would obtain a five-year loan for $16,000 to cover the remaining amount owed to the car dealer.

Her personal balance sheet would be affected as shown in Exhibit 2.8 and explained next.

Exhibit 2.8 Stephanie Spratt’s Personal Balance Sheet if She Purchases a New Car

Change in Stephanie’s Assets
Stephanie’s assets would change as follows:
Her car would now have a market value of $16,000 (assuming 20% depreciation in the market value of the new car) instead of $1,000.

Her checking account balance would be reduced from $3,500 to $500.

Thus, her total assets would increase by $12,000 (her new car would be valued at $15,000 more than her old one, but her checking account would be reduced by $3,000).

Change in Stephanie’s Liabilities
Stephanie’s liabilities would also change:

She would now have a long-term liability of $16,000 as a result of the car loan.

Therefore, her total liabilities would increase by $16,000 if she purchases the car.

Change in Stephanie’s Net Worth
If Stephanie purchases the car, her net worth would be:

Net Worth
=
Total Assets
−
Total Liabilities
=

Stephanie’s net worth would decline because the value of her assets would increase by a smaller amount than the increase in her liabilities.

Stephanie’s Decision
Because the purchase of a new car would increase her debt level substantially, she decides not to purchase the car at this time. Still, she is concerned that her old car will require expensive maintenance in the future, so she will likely buy a car after she improves her financial position.

How Cash Flows Affect the Personal Balance Sheet
The relationship between the personal cash flow statement and the personal balance sheet is shown in Exhibit 2.9. This relationship explains how you build wealth (net worth) over time. If you use net cash flows to invest in more assets, you increase the value of your assets without increasing your liabilities. Therefore, you increase your net worth. You can also increase your net worth by using net cash flows to reduce your liabilities. Thus, the more of your income that you allocate to investing in assets or to reducing your debt, the more wealth you will build.

Exhibit 2.9 How Net Cash Flows Can Be Used to Increase Net Worth

Figure 2.9 Full Alternative Text
Your net worth can change even if your net cash flows are zero. For example, if the market value of your car declines over time, the value of this asset is reduced, and your net worth will decline. Conversely, if the value of a stock that you own increases, the value of your assets will rise, and your net worth will increase.

Impact of the Economy on the Personal Balance Sheet
ECONOMIC IMPACT

Economic conditions can affect your cash flows and therefore affect your personal balance sheet, as illustrated in Exhibit 2.10. Favorable economic conditions can increase job opportunities and therefore your income. You can use the extra income to increase your net worth by investing in more assets or paying off some of your liabilities. Favorable economic conditions can also boost your net worth by boosting the market value of the assets you own. During a strong economy, consumers tend to increase their demand for some types of assets such as homes or stocks, which can increase the market values of those assets.
Exhibit 2.10 The Impact of the Economy on the Personal Balance Sheet

Figure 2.10 Full Alternative Text
Unfavorable economic conditions tend to reduce your job opportunities and income. If you earn less income, your net worth may decline because you can no longer afford to invest in assets or pay off your liabilities. Such unfavorable conditions might also reduce your net worth by reducing the market value of the assets you own.

Some economic crises have had a devastating effect on the net worth of some individuals. During the credit crisis in 2008, many people lost their jobs due to a major slowdown in the construction of new homes and apartments. Their incomes declined, which prevented them from investing in more assets. It also prevented some of them from paying off their existing liabilities. The market values of their homes declined substantially, further reducing their net worth. The coronavirus pandemic in 2020 forced the closure of many restaurants and other small businesses (especially those in the travel industries), which led to many job layoffs and a decline in income.

Analysis of the Personal Balance Sheet
The budgeting process helps you monitor your cash flows and evaluate your net worth. In addition, by analyzing some financial characteristics within your personal balance sheet or cash flow statement, you can monitor your level of liquidity, your amount of debt, and your ability to save.

Liquidity
Recall that liquidity represents your access to funds to cover any short-term cash needs. You need to monitor your liquidity over time to ensure that you have sufficient funds when they are needed. Your liquidity can be measured by the liquidity ratio, which is calculated as:

Liquidity Ratio
=
Liquid Assets/Current Liabilities
A high liquidity ratio indicates a high degree of liquidity. For example, a liquidity ratio of 3.0 implies that for every dollar of liabilities that you will need to pay off in the near future, you have $3 in liquid assets. Thus, you could easily cover your short-term liabilities.

A liquidity ratio of less than 1.0 means that you do not have sufficient liquid assets to cover your upcoming payments. In this case, you might need to borrow funds.
Example

Maridav/Shutterstock

Stephanie does not have any current liabilities. She periodically uses a credit card instead of cash for convenience but always pays the balance off every month, so that by the end of the month, she has no credit card balance. She only makes credit card purchases when she knows that she has sufficient current assets (her checking account) to pay off the balance. Overall, Stephanie consistently maintains adequate liquidity.

Debt Level
You also need to monitor your debt level to ensure that it does not become so high that you are unable to cover your debt payments. A debt level of $20,000 would not be a serious problem for a person with assets of $100,000, but it could be quite serious for someone with hardly any assets. Thus, your debt level should be measured relative to your assets, as shown here:

Debt-to-Asset Ratio
=
Total Liabilities/Total Assets
A high debt ratio indicates an excessive amount of debt and should be reduced over time to avoid any debt repayment problems. Individuals in this position should review their cash flows to maximize inflows and minimize outflows.

Example

Maridav/Shutterstock

Based on her personal balance sheet, Stephanie calculates her debt-to-asset ratio as:

Debt-to-Asset Ratio
=
Total Liabilities/Total Assets
=
$
10,000
/
$
6,000
=
166.7
%
This debt-to-asset ratio is high, but now that Stephanie has graduated college and started a full-time job, she is well-positioned to pay off her debt.

Savings Rate
To determine the proportion of disposable income that you save, you can measure your savings over a particular period in comparison to your disposable income (income after taxes are taken out) using the following formula:

Savings Rate
=
Savings during the Period/Disposable Income during the Period
Example

Maridav/Shutterstock

Based on her cash flow statement, Stephanie has cash inflows (disposable income) of about $3,000 per month and net cash flows of $400 for savings. She calculates her typical savings rate per month as:

Savings Rate
=
Savings during the Period/Disposable Income during the Period
=
$
400
/
$
3,000
=
13.33
%
Thus, Stephanie saves 13% of her disposable income. If she achieves her goal of saving $500 per month (as described earlier), her savings rate would be 16.7% (computed as $500/$3,000).
How Budgeting Influences Your Financial Plan
The key budgeting decisions for building your financial plan are:

How can I improve my net cash flows in the near future?

How can I improve my net cash flows in the distant future?

These decisions influence all aspects of your financial plan, including your liquidity, personal financing, protection of wealth, personal investing, and retirement and estate planning. By limiting your spending, you may be able to increase your net cash flows, your liquidity, and your net worth. Exhibit 2.11 provides an example of how the budgeting decisions apply to Stephanie Spratt’s financial plan.

Summary
PERSONAL CASH FLOW STATEMENT. The personal cash flow statement measures your cash inflows, your cash outflows, and their difference (net cash flows) over a specific period. Cash inflows result from your salary or income generated by your investments. Cash outflows result from your spending.

FACTORS AFFECTING CASH FLOWS. Your cash inflows are primarily affected by the stage in your career path and your type of job. Your cash outflows are influenced by your family status, age, and personal consumption behavior. If you develop specialized skills, you may be able to obtain a job that increases your cash inflows. If you limit your consumption, you can limit your spending and therefore reduce your cash outflows. Either of these actions will increase net cash flows and thus allow you to increase your wealth.

FORECASTING YOUR CASH FLOWS. You can forecast your net cash flows (and therefore anticipate cash deficiencies) by creating a budget, which is based on forecasted cash inflows and outflows for an upcoming period.

Comparing your forecasted and actual income and expenses will show whether you were able to stay within the budget. By examining the difference between your forecast and the actual cash flow, you can determine areas of your budget that may need further control or areas of your budget that required fewer expenditures than you predicted. This analysis will help you modify your spending in the future or perhaps adjust your future budgets.

PERSONAL BALANCE SHEET. The personal balance sheet measures the value of your assets, your liabilities, and your net worth. The assets can be categorized into liquid assets, household assets, and investments. Liabilities can be categorized as current or long-term liabilities. The difference between total assets and total liabilities is net worth, which is a measure of your wealth.

The net cash flows on the personal cash flow statement are related to the net worth on the personal balance sheet. When you have positive net cash flows over a period, you can invest that amount in additional assets, which increases your net worth (or your wealth). Alternatively, you may use the net cash flows to pay off liabilities, which also increases your wealth.

HOW BUDGETING INFLUENCES YOUR FINANCIAL PLAN. Decisions that reduce your spending can improve both your budget and your financial plan, including your liquidity, personal financing, and all other components of your financial plan.
