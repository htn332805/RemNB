Description
When you are asked to make a charitable contribution, you may be reminded that the donation is deductible on your taxes because the organization is a not-for-profit agency. You may also hear, at some point in your life, that you should purchase a home because the mortgage interest and the tax you pay on your property can be deducted from your income when determining your federal income tax.

What you might not realize is that the deductions just mentioned are itemized deductions. Their benefit does not begin until the total of all of your itemized deductions exceeds the standard deduction. As you will learn in this chapter, for single taxpayers in 2023 that threshold was $13,850 and double that for married taxpayers. So if you purchase a home and pay $10,000 in mortgage interest, you will not have any real tax benefit unless you can add other deductions that total more than the standard deduction amount. Yet some circumstances offer tax benefits even if you do not itemize your deductions, such as paying interest on a student loan or contributing to your retirement account.

Many taxpayers are intimidated by the tax system and hire an expert to determine how much taxes they owe for a particular year. However, most taxpayers could easily estimate their taxes in a short amount of time. This chapter gives a very simple explanation of how you can determine your taxes. Once you understand the process, you may have the confidence to estimate your taxes or use software that can do so. Furthermore, you may properly account for any particular circumstances that allow you to reduce your taxable income and therefore reduce your taxes. Knowledge of some basic tax laws can help you improve your financial planning decisions.

The objectives of this chapter are to
Provide a background on the tax system.

Explain how to calculate your taxable income.

Explain how to calculate your taxes if you take the standard deduction.

Explain how to calculate your taxes if you itemize your deductions.

Describe conditions that can provide you with tax benefits.

Explain how tax planning fits within your financial plan.
Background on the Tax System
When you are managing your income, you decide how much of your disposable income should be allocated to necessities and discretionary spending in a particular month (as discussed in Chapter 2), and the remainder is savings. You can also manage your disposable income over the long term by limiting your periodic spending to achieve a specific level of savings in the distant future (Chapter 3). Now we turn to how you can manage your income through tax planning so that you minimize the amount of your income that is taxable every year. This chapter explains how to determine the taxes that you owe for a particular year based on your income and other information. It also explains various legal methods that you can use to reduce your taxes.

Taxes are a significant source of funding for governments and governmental agencies in the United States. They are used to pay for a wide variety of governmental services and programs, including national defense, Social Security, fire and police protection, and our education systems. Individuals pay taxes at the federal, state, and local levels. Congress periodically revises the federal tax laws that provide guidelines for how much taxes people must pay based on their income and other criteria.

The federal tax system is administered by a branch of the U.S. Treasury Department called the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS enforces federal tax laws and attempts to ensure that taxpayers pay the amount of taxes that they owe. Taxpayers owe federal income taxes on both their earned and their unearned income. Earned income is income from employment, such as salary, wages, and tips. Unearned income is income from investments such as dividends from stocks and interest paid on a savings account.

earned income
Income from employment, such as salary, wages, and tips.

unearned income
Income from investments such as dividends and stocks as well as interest paid on savings.

One of the ways that the IRS ensures that it collects the taxes owed is the withholding system, in which your employer (if you are an employee of the business) withholds a portion of your paycheck and sends the money to the IRS to pay the taxes that you owe on that income. The portion of your paycheck that your employer withholds is referred to as a withholding tax, which is used to pay your Social Security, Medicare, and personal income taxes. If you are not an employee and are not subject to the withholding system, you are responsible for paying the taxes due.

withholding tax
Portion of your paycheck that is withheld by the employer and sent to the IRS.

Social Security and Medicare Taxes
Your earned income is subject to FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare. The Social Security taxes are used by the Social Security Administration (a branch of the U.S. government) to make payments to taxpayers upon their retirement (subject to age and other requirements). Medicare is a government health insurance program that covers people 65 years of age and older by making payments to their health care providers. The Social Security tax is equal to 6.20% of your salary up to a maximum salary ($160,200 as of 2023) that increases over time, and the Medicare tax is equal to 1.45% of your salary without a maximum salary limit. Your employer withholds FICA taxes from each of your paychecks and also pays FICA taxes on your behalf equal to the amount that is withheld from your paychecks. You do not need to submit any tax forms or do anything to pay your FICA taxes, but you should at least be aware that your employer will be withholding some of your income every pay period to pay these taxes on your behalf. Because the formula for FICA taxes is the same for everyone, you can calculate the amount of FICA taxes that you will pay over the year.

Stephanie Spratt recently started her full-time job. Her annual salary for this year will be $43,000. She knows that she will be subject to a total FICA tax rate of 7.65%, which is based on 6.20% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare. She wants to determine how much FICA taxes she will pay for the entire year. She completes the following table:

 	Social Security Tax	Medicare Tax	Total FICA Taxes
Tax Rate	6.20%	1.45%	7.65%
Tax Amount	
6.20

3,289
Thus, over the year Stephanie will pay FICA taxes of $3,289, which her employer will withhold from her paycheck.

Personal Income Taxes
Your income is also subject to personal income taxes, which are taxes imposed on your income. In addition to withholding for FICA taxes, your employer withholds a portion of your paycheck for your personal income taxes (also referred to as federal income taxes). The specific percentage of income that is withheld to pay personal income taxes varies among taxpayers based on factors such as the salary amount and number of dependents.

personal income taxes
Taxes imposed on personal income.

Tax Forms
Each year you must complete a tax return using tax forms developed by the IRS that discloses your income and other information used to calculate the total personal income taxes that you owe (sometimes referred to as your personal income tax liability) for the year. The year used to calculate your personal income taxes ends on December 31. You must complete and submit your tax return to the IRS by April 15 of the following year.

The primary income tax form to complete when submitting your tax return to the IRS is Form 1040. This form allows you to report your total income and deductions that can be subtracted from your total income to derive your taxable income. However, you may also need to include supplemental forms when submitting your tax return to clarify some types of income or deductions.

You can download tax forms from the IRS website at www.irs.gov/forms-instructions.

Comparing Your Tax Liability and Withholding Tax
When completing your tax return, you will compare your personal income tax liability for the year (based on your calculation on the IRS tax form) to the amount of income withheld by your employer over the year, which is how much personal income tax you have already paid to the IRS. The amount of your income that was withheld may not perfectly match the personal income taxes that you owe for the year. For example, if you earned interest on your savings account, you must report the interest on your tax form as personal income, but no taxes are withheld from that type of income. Therefore, your tax liability for the year may be higher than the total amount of personal income taxes that were withheld from your paycheck. In that case, you will need to include a payment to the IRS for the difference when you submit your completed tax return to the IRS. Conversely, if your personal income tax liability for the year is less than the total amount of personal income taxes that were withheld from your paycheck, the IRS will send you a refund for the difference.

Using Tax Preparation Software
Many taxpayers use tax preparation software to determine their tax liability. For example, H&R Block and TurboTax are tax preparation businesses that offer several versions of tax preparation software, ranging from basic tax preparation software for taxpayers with simple tax returns to more sophisticated software for taxpayers with complicated tax returns. The software is often updated annually to account for any applicable changes in tax laws. Thus, using tax preparation software from a credible business can ensure that your tax return is accurate, assuming that the information you entered into the software was accurate. Yet if you understand the process that is used to determine your tax liability, you may be more able to recognize various ways to legally minimize your tax liability.

Your Filing Status
To calculate your personal income tax liability, you must first determine your specific filing status. The alternatives are as follows:

Single

Married filing jointly

Married filing separately

Head of household

Qualifying surviving spouse

The filing status is important because it affects the rate at which your income is taxed. Married people usually combine their incomes and file a joint return. However, a married couple may file separate tax returns in some circumstances. The head of household status can be selected by single people who have at least one dependent in their household. The tax rates applied when using this status, or the qualifying surviving spouse, may be more favorable than when filing under the single status.
Calculating Your Taxable Income
Before you determine your federal income tax liability for the year, you must first calculate your taxable income by following these three steps:

Determine your gross income (reportable income from all sources).

Subtract your IRA contribution and interest expenses on your student loan (if any) to determine your adjusted gross income.

Apply your allowable deduction (standard or itemized).

These steps are described next.

Gross Income
First, you will determine your gross income, which consists of all reportable income from any source. It includes your salary or wages, interest income, dividend income, and capital gains received during the tax year. It also includes income from your own business as well as from tips, prizes and awards, rental property, and scholarships that exceed tuition fees and book costs. Some types of income are not taxed, including health and casualty insurance reimbursements, child support payments received, veteran’s benefits, and welfare benefits.

gross income
All reportable income from any source, including salary, net business income, interest income, dividend income, and capital gains received during the tax year.

Wages and Salaries
If you work full-time, your main source of gross income is probably your salary. Wages and salaries, along with any bonuses, are subject to federal income taxes. You and the IRS should receive a W-2 form from your employer about two months before the tax deadline, and you can use this form to verify the income you earned from that employer. Contributions to your employer-sponsored retirement account, whether made by you or your employer, are not subject to income taxes until those funds are withdrawn from the account. Consequently, they are not subject to immediate taxation. Many employees take advantage of their employer-sponsored retirement plans to reduce their current income taxes and obtain tax-deferred growth of their retirement fund.

Interest Income
Individuals can earn interest income from investments in various types of savings accounts or certificates of deposit at financial institutions. They can also earn interest income from investing in debt securities such as Treasury bonds or from providing loans to other individuals.

interest income
Interest earned from investments in various types of savings accounts at financial institutions, from investments in debt securities such as Treasury bonds, or from providing loans to other individuals.

Dividend Income
Individual taxpayers can earn dividend income by investing in stocks or mutual funds. Some firms pay dividends to their shareholders quarterly. Other firms elect not to pay dividends to their shareholders and instead reinvest all their earnings to finance their existing operations. This can benefit shareholders because a firm’s share price is more likely to appreciate over time if the firm reinvests all its earnings. Dividend income is generally taxed at more favorable rates than salaries or interest income, but that topic is beyond the scope of this chapter. If you have income from dividends, consult the instructions provided by the IRS on how to treat it.

dividend income
Income received in the form of dividends paid on shares of stock or mutual funds.

Capital Gains
You can purchase securities (also called financial assets) such as stocks or debt instruments (such as bonds) that are issued by firms to raise capital. You can also invest in other income-producing assets such as rental properties. When you sell these types of assets at a higher price than you paid, you earn a capital gain. If you sell the assets for a lower price than you paid, you sustain a capital loss. Capital gains are generally taxed at more favorable rates than salaries or interest income, as discussed later in the chapter.

capital gain
Income earned when an asset is sold at a price higher than that paid for the asset.
Calculating Gross Income
Gross income is determined by adding your salary, interest income, dividend income, and capital gains.

Example

As Stephanie Spratt recently started her full-time job, she wants to determine what her personal income taxes will be for the entire year. Her annual salary for the entire year will be $43,000. She earned no income from interest, dividends, or short-term capital gains. Her gross income over the year is as follows:

Salary	$43,000
+
 Interest Income
0
+
 Dividend Income
0
+
 Capital Gain
   0
=
 Gross Income
$43,000
Adjusted Gross Income
Your adjusted gross income (AGI) is calculated by adjusting your gross income for contributions to individual retirement accounts (IRAs), interest paid on student loans (up to a $2,500 limit), and other special circumstances.

adjusted gross income (AGI)
Gross income adjusted for contributions to IRAs, interest paid on student loans, and other special circumstances.

This year, Stephanie Spratt will not contribute any of her salary to an IRA, but she will start paying off her student loan. Her interest payments for her student loan will be about $600 for the year. Therefore, her adjusted gross income is as follows:

Standard Deduction
When determining your taxable income, you are allowed to take a deduction from your adjusted gross income. This deduction is important because it reduces your taxable income, which reduces your personal income tax liability. You can choose between two methods of applying a deduction to your adjusted gross income:

You can take a standard deduction from adjusted gross income to determine taxable income. The standard deduction in tax year 2023 was $13,850 for single taxpayers and $27,700 for married taxpayers filing a joint return.

standard deduction
A fixed amount that can be deducted from adjusted gross income to determine taxable income.

If you incurred specific expenses over the year that qualify as itemized deductions (such as interest payments on a mortgage), you may choose to itemize your deductions rather than taking the standard deduction. The specific types of itemized deductions that are allowed are described later in this chapter.

Taxpayers will choose to apply the standard deduction rather than itemize their deductions when the total of their itemized deductions fails to exceed the standard deduction. Choosing the standard deduction results in lower personal income tax for many taxpayers.

Example

Stephanie Spratt’s filing status is single. She does not have a mortgage and would not benefit from itemizing deductions. Recall that her adjusted gross income is $42,400. She chooses to take the standard deduction of $13,850, which causes her taxable income to be as follows:

Calculating Your Taxes if You Take the Standard Deduction
To calculate your personal income tax, you need to apply the tax rate that applies to your specific tax bracket. The tax rate that applies to each of the seven different brackets is shown in Exhibit 4.1. Panel A of the exhibit (at the top) shows the income brackets and corresponding tax rates for taxpayers who file single, while Panel B of the exhibit shows the income brackets and corresponding tax rates for taxpayers who are married and file jointly.

Exhibit 4.1 Tax Brackets Applied to Determine Personal Income Taxes

Table 4.1 Full Alternative Text
Single Filer Calculation of Personal Income Taxes
Review Panel A of Exhibit 4.1 as you continue reading to understand how these brackets are applied to determine your personal income taxes. Panel A shows that taxpayers filing single are subject to a 10% tax on their first $11,000 of taxable income (see the first bracket), then a 12% tax on taxable income above that level up to $44,725 (see the second bracket), then a 22% tax on taxable income above that level up to $95,375 (see the third bracket), and so on.

The specific tax bracket whose income range includes the taxpayer’s taxable income is referred to as the marginal tax bracket. Thus, if you file single and your taxable income is $30,000, your marginal tax bracket is the second tax bracket. In this case, your income associated with the first bracket ($11,000) is taxed at 10%, while your remaining (marginal) income is included in the second bracket and therefore is taxed at 12%. The tax rate imposed on the taxable income within your marginal tax bracket is referred to as your marginal tax rate. It is the rate that would be imposed on any additional income earned beyond the bracket below it. In this example, the marginal tax rate is 12%.

marginal tax bracket
Tax bracket specifying the income range that includes a taxpayer’s annual taxable income.

marginal tax rate
The tax rate imposed on any additional (marginal) income earned.

If your taxable income is $50,000, you are in the third tax bracket, so your taxes are determined by the tax rates in the first three tax brackets. Specifically, your income associated with the first bracket ($11,000) is taxed at 10%, your income associated with the second bracket (from income $11,000 to income $44,725) is taxed at 12%, and your remaining income associated with the third bracket is taxed at 22%. Notice that as you reach higher taxable income brackets, the tax rates applied to those brackets are higher. This structure is intended to make taxpayers who have higher levels of taxable income pay a higher percentage of their taxable income as taxes.

If you file single, and your taxable income for the year is less than $11,000 (the maximum income within the first bracket), you would be subject to a tax rate of 10% on all of your taxable income (because all of your income is covered by the first bracket). However, if your taxable income exceeds $11,000, you would pay the 10% tax on the first $11,000 (first tax bracket), then a higher tax rate on a your taxable income beyond $11,000 (beyond the first tax bracket). Now that you understand the process of applying tax rates across income brackets, you can calculate your personal income taxes based on your specific taxable income for the year.

For example, if your taxable income is $20,000 for the year, you fall into the second (12%) marginal tax bracket. Your taxes can be computed as follows:

Tax Rate	On Taxable Income of:	Tax Amount
10%	$11,000	
10
%

11,000

If your taxable income is $50,000 for the year, you fall into the third tax bracket. Consequently, your taxes can be computed as follows:

10%	$11,000	
10

If your taxable income for the year is higher than $95,375 and less than $182,100, you would be in the fourth tax bracket, which means your personal income tax would be determined by the first four tax brackets. At the extreme, if your taxable income for the year is greater than $578,125, a portion of your income is taxed within each of all seven tax brackets shown in Panel A of Exhibit 4.1, with the income in each bracket associated with the tax rate for that particular bracket.

Example

Stephanie Spratt’s taxable income of $28,550 over this year falls into the second income bracket. Therefore, her personal income taxes will be determined by the first (10%) and second (12%) tax brackets, as shown here:

Recall that Stephanie will also pay FICA taxes of $3,289 along with her $3,206 in personal income taxes. Thus, her total taxes will be $6,495, which represents about 15% of her $43,000 salary. Joint Filer Calculation of Personal Income Taxes
Panel B of Exhibit 4.1 shows that taxpayers who are married and filing jointly are subject to a 10% tax on their first $22,000 of taxable income, then a 12% tax on taxable income above that level up to $89,450, then a 22% tax on taxable income above that level up to $190,750, and so on. The maximum income in each bracket of Panel B is substantially larger than the corresponding bracket in Panel A because the taxable income is for a married couple in Panel B versus one person in Panel A. Notice that taxpayers filing jointly with higher levels of taxable income are subject to higher tax rates, just as single taxpayers are.

The process of determining the personal income tax for a married couple filing jointly is the same as the process of determining the personal income tax for a person filing single.

Example
If a married couple had taxable income of $90,000 for the year, they would pay:

10% tax on their taxable income up to $22,000 (first income bracket in Panel B),

12% tax on the taxable income from $22,000 to $89,450 (which represents taxable income of $67,450 in the second bracket of Panel B), and

22% tax on their remaining taxable income from $89,450 to $90,000 (which represents taxable income of $550 in the third bracket of Panel B).

The couple’s tax is computed as follows:

Exhibit 4.2 illustrates how the tax brackets are used to determine your personal income taxes. The chart shows seven bars, each of which represents a specific tax bracket. You begin with the first bar (the lowest income bracket) and move from one bar to the next until you reach the bar representing the tax bracket that includes your annual taxable income. Each bar along your path is meaningful, because you pay the tax rate corresponding to that bar on the portion of your taxable income included in that tax bracket. Specifically, the chart illustrates how your taxable income associated with the first bracket (represented by the first bar) is taxed at 10%, your income associated with the second tax bracket (represented by the second bar) is taxed at 12%, and so on.

Exhibit 4.2 How the Income Bracket Influences Tax Rate

Figure 4.2 Full Alternative Text
Summary of Determining Your Personal Income Taxes with the Standard Deduction
In summary, if you take the standard deduction rather than itemize deductions, you can follow this simple process to determine your taxes (unless you have some special circumstances that complicate your tax calculation):
Start with your salary and add any interest income to derive your gross income.

Subtract IRA contributions and interest paid on your student loans (up to $2,500) from your gross income to derive your adjusted gross income.

Subtract your standard deduction to derive your taxable income.

Apply the proper tax rates from the tax brackets to derive your personal income tax.

A fifth step would be needed if you qualify for the child tax credit or other credits discussed later in the chapter. If you have the information that you need, you can determine your personal income taxes quickly.

Calculating Your Taxes if You Itemize Deductions
Itemized deductions are specific types of expenses that can be deducted to reduce your taxable personal income. The U.S. Congress has approved these itemized deductions as tax preference items to encourage certain behaviors such as home ownership and support of not-for-profit organizations. Recall that you can choose to itemize your deductions instead of taking the standard deduction when calculating your personal income taxes. Some of the more common itemized deductions are described next.

itemized deductions
Specific expenses that can be deducted to reduce taxable income.

Interest Expenses on Mortgage Loans
When people borrow funds to purchase a home, they pay interest on the money that they borrow. The annual interest payments made on their mortgage loans are an itemized deduction. Before the 2017 tax law, interest paid on the first $1,000,000 of a mortgage was deductible. Existing mortgages still retain that tax treatment, but for new mortgages interest is only deductible on the first $750,000 of the mortgage. Interest payments made on car loans and other types of consumer loans are not tax deductible.

State and Local Taxes
Many states impose a state income tax on people who receive income from employers in that state. Local municipalities such as large cities or counties may also impose an income tax. Owners of homes or other real estate are subject to a real estate tax (or property tax) imposed by the county where the property is located. These types of state and local taxes are deductible as itemized deductions. However, the deduction that can be applied for all state and local taxes in aggregate is capped at a maximum of $10,000.

real estate tax
A tax imposed on a home or other real estate in the county where the property is located.

Medical Expenses
Taxpayers with medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of their adjusted gross income may deduct that excess amount as an itemized deduction. Notice that the amount of medical expenses that is equal to or less than 7.5% of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income is not deductible. This deduction is specifically for people who incur an unusually high level of medical expenses relative to their income in a particular year.

Eligible medical expenses include diagnosing, treating, easing, or preventing disease; health insurance premiums paid for policies that cover medical care or long-term care insurance; and the cost of prescription drugs and insulin. For more examples of costs you can deduct, see IRS Publication 502, Medical and Dental Expenses. Only unreimbursed medical expenses are deductible.

Charitable Gifts
People who make charitable gifts to qualified organizations can deduct their contributions as an itemized deduction (total donations are subject to a cap of 50% of the donor’s adjusted gross income). You should keep track of all your charitable contributions throughout the year, whether you paid by cash, check, or credit card. For large contributions, you will need a receipt from the charitable organization; many organizations, such as churches, will send a confirmation of all donations as a matter of policy. You may deduct the value of property donated to charitable organizations. If the property is valuable, you should probably obtain a professional appraisal.

Comparison of Itemized Deductions to the Standard Deduction
Some taxpayers do not own a home, contribute to charities, or have any other characteristics that would allow them to benefit from itemizing their deductions; their best option is to take the standard deduction when calculating their personal income taxes. However, other taxpayers may benefit from itemizing their deductions. If their itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction, they can reduce their personal income taxes by itemizing their deductions.

Example
Eli has a salary of $70,000, which is the same as his adjusted gross income because he does not contribute to an IRA and has no interest expenses on student loans. He will file for taxes as a single taxpayer and therefore has the option to apply the standard deduction of $12,000 to reduce his taxable income. If Eli chooses to itemize his deductions, he can claim the following deductions for the year:

He owns a large home and paid about $20,000 in interest on his mortgage.

He paid property taxes of about $7,000.

He made charitable gifts of about $3,000.

Notice that his total itemized deductions add up to $30,000, which exceeds the standard deduction of $13,850. Therefore, Eli will benefit from itemizing his deductions rather than taking the standard deduction. Exhibit 4.4 shows a detailed comparison of the tax calculation if Eli applies a standard deduction (second column) versus if he itemizes his deductions (third column).

The second column of Exhibit 4.4 shows that if Eli claimed a standard deduction of $13,850, he could not apply the itemized deductions. His personal income taxes would be $7,660. However, the third column of Exhibit 4.4 shows that if Eli itemizes his deductions, he can deduct $30,000 instead of the standard deduction of $13,850 from his taxable income. In this case, Eli’s personal income taxes would be $4,580, which is $3,080 less than if he takes the standard deduction. This example illustrates how some people can reduce their taxes substantially if they itemize their tax deductions.
Conditions That Can Provide Tax Benefits
Whether you take the standard deduction or itemize your deductions, you may be able to reduce your personal income tax liability if you experience any of the following conditions that would allow you to receive income tax credits, tax exemptions, or other tax benefits.

Child Tax Credits
If you have one or more children, you may be eligible for the child tax credit, which is allowed for each child in a household who is less than 17 years old at the end of the tax year. The child must be either a U.S. citizen or a resident alien. The child tax credit in 2023 was worth $2,000 per child. The child tax credit is not available to households above certain income levels, but taxpayers who owe no taxes may still receive up to $1,600 of the credit per child provided they meet certain minimum income levels. The child tax credit was increased during the pandemic but returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2022.

Tax Credits
Tax credits offset taxes on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as the full amount of the tax credit is subtracted from taxes owed: A tax credit of $1,000 will reduce your taxes by $1,000. Compare this result with the effect of a $1,000 deduction, which reduces your taxable income by $1,000 but reduces your taxes by only a proportion of that amount. For this reason, a dollar’s worth of tax credits is more valuable than a dollar’s worth of deductions.

Child and Dependent Care Credit
The child and dependent care credit (CDCC) is a special credit for parents or caregivers who incur expenses associated with the care of a child under the age of 13 as a result of working or pursuing employment. The types of expenses that qualify include preschool and after-school care programs as well as day camps. The person who is incurring the expenses must claim the child as a dependent to qualify for this credit, although there may be some exceptions. The amount of the credit is measured as a percentage of expenses that the parents or caregivers incur, and the percentage is higher for parents or caregivers with a lower adjusted gross income. The credit for one dependent is doubled if there are two or more dependents. The credit may also be extended for a spouse who is mentally or physically unable to care for themselves and has lived in the household more than one-half of the year. The maximum allowable credit was increased during the pandemic but has since returned to pre-pandemic levels.

College Expense Tax Credits and Education Savings Plans
College expense credits are tax credits that can help parents and students pay for college by lowering their taxes, while some education savings plans allow for income or gains on investments to be tax exempt.

college expense credits
A tax credit allowed to those who contribute to their own or their dependents’ college expenses.

Example
Reconsider the case of the married couple whose taxable income was $90,000 and whose total tax was $10,415. If they had a child under the age of 17, they would be able to apply a credit of $2,000, which would reduce their personal income tax to $8,415. If they had two children under the age of 17, they would be able to apply a tax credit of

 which would reduce their personal income tax to $6,415.

American Opportunity Tax Credit
The American opportunity tax credit allows students (or their parents who claim them as dependents) to receive a tax credit of 100% of the first $2,000 that they spend on college expenses and a tax credit of 25% on up to $2,000 of additional college expenses in each year of a four-year period. The credit is phased out if their income is above specific limits, which increase over time.

Lifetime Learning Tax Credit
The lifetime learning tax credit allows undergraduate, graduate, or vocational students or their parents to claim 20% of the first $10,000 of college expenses (such as tuition, fees, and books) per year as a tax credit. Like the American opportunity tax credit, the lifetime learning tax credit is phased out for higher-income taxpayers. The American opportunity tax credit and the lifetime learning tax credit cannot both be claimed for the same student in the same year.
Coverdell Savings Accounts
Coverdell education savings accounts allow contributions of up to $2,000 per year. These accounts can be used for a wide variety of elementary, high school, and college expenses including tuition, fees, academic tutoring, books, supplies, and equipment. The contribution to this account is not tax deductible, but when money in the account is invested and generates income, that income is exempt from federal taxes if withdrawals from the account are used for appropriate education expenses. Taxpayers must earn income below specific limits to qualify for these savings accounts.

Section 529 Savings Plan
Parents can invest funds in a 529 savings plan, in which the money invested will ultimately be used to pay for their children’s educational expenses. The savings plan does not provide tax credits, but any income or gains earned within the savings plan are exempt from federal taxes as long as the money in the account is ultimately used to pay for elementary, high school, or college expenses. Some states impose a state tax on income earned within the account when funds are withdrawn and used to pay educational expenses. All parents are eligible for a 529 plan, regardless of their income. If the parents decide not to use the funds to pay for the designated child’s educational expenses, they can withdraw the funds, but the funds are then subject to significant penalties. However, they have the option to shift the funds to another child within the family.

You can set up a 529 savings plan with a particular state agency in the state where you reside or with an investment firm such as Fidelity or Vanguard. If your state charges income tax, and if you contribute to the 529 fund established by that state, you may qualify for a state tax deduction or credit. You can decide how the money that you contribute to the 529 savings plan is invested by choosing among the various investment funds (called mutual funds, which are described in detail in Chapter 17) that have been established by the investment firm or the state agency that is managing the plan.

A management fee is taken out of any of the funds in which you invest. Some funds are designed to match a particular type of stock index and are easier to manage. Therefore, the typical management fee associated with an index fund is relatively low compared with the management fee associated with an actively managed fund. You can review the exact details online for any investment firm that offers a 529 savings plan.

Prepaid Tuition 529 Plans
Prepaid 529 plans allow parents to prepay tuition and fees at state colleges for their children, the ultimate beneficiaries. The beneficiary must be no more than 15 years old when the prepaid 529 account is created. The primary benefit of this type of plan is that the tuition you will ultimately pay is based on the existing state tuition at the time you make the contributions. Thus, by paying all the tuition before the beneficiary enrolls, you can avoid subsequent increases in tuition levels.

This plan is less flexible than the 529 savings plan, as states tend to restrict enrollment periodically in any given year. Furthermore, the money can usually only be used for tuition and cannot be used for room and board or some other expenses, but there may be exceptions in some states. Search online for any particular state in which you may be interested to determine the specific rules. Many states that had once offered the prepaid tuition plans are no longer offering them, which may be due to their restrictions and to the more desirable flexibility of the 529 savings plans.

Residential Clean Air Credit
A tax credit is available to homeowners who incur expenses for the installation of solar heating or solar electricity panels. The credit can also be applied to a second home or vacation home. The credit is up to 30% of the expenses incurred.

Electric Vehicle Credit
A tax credit of up to $7,500 is available to taxpayers who purchase an electric vehicle (EV) for their own use (not for resale) within the United States. To qualify for the credit, taxpayers must earn income that is no more than the specified limits: $225,000 for taxpayers who file as head of household and $300,000 for married couples. The EV that they purchase must also satisfy some additional requirements, including specific battery and critical mineral requirements, and final assembly must be within the United States. Some states offer an additional tax credit for taxpayers who purchase an EV that reduces their state taxes.

Earned Income Credit
The earned income credit is a special credit for low-income taxpayers that reduces the amount of taxes owed, if any. To qualify, you must work, have earned income, and have a limited investment income and adjusted gross income under specified limits that change over time. The maximum income tax credit is highest if you have three or more children.

Investments That Offer Tax Benefits
Some types of investments offer tax benefits in the form of either a tax exemption on the income earned or a lower tax rate applied to the gain on the investment.

Debt Issued by Municipalities
The income (coupon payments) earned from investing in debt securities issued by municipalities is commonly exempt from federal taxes. This topic is discussed in more detail in Chapter 16.

Long-Term Capital Gains
A long-term capital gain is a gain from an investment in assets that were held for longer than 12 months. A long-term capital gain is not taxed for individuals with annual income less than $44,625 for taxpayers filing single and $89,250 for married taxpayers filing jointly and is taxed at 15% or 20% for others, depending on their income level. The limits change over time. The long-term capital gains tax rate is normally lower than what the tax rate would be if the gain were taxed as ordinary income for any taxpayers. A short-term capital gain is a gain on assets that were held for 12 months or less, and that gain is treated just like ordinary income, so there is no tax benefit. Capital gains taxes are discussed in more detail in Chapter 14.

short-term capital gain

Holding an investment for more than one year can yield significant tax benefits, assuming that you have a gain. But taxation of your capital gains is just one of many factors that should be considered when making your investment decisions.
How Tax Planning Fits within Your Financial Plan
Tax planning involves taking actions throughout the year to be able to pay the least amount of taxes allowed by law. If you can reduce your taxes, you increase your disposable income and therefore can increase your net worth. The key tax planning decisions for building your financial plan are the following:

What tax savings are currently available to you?

How can you increase your tax savings in the future?

What records should you keep?

An example of how the tax concepts apply to Stephanie Spratt’s financial plan is provided in Exhibit 4.5.

Summary
BACKGROUND ON TAXES. Your earned income is subject to FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act), taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare, and personal income taxes. If you have an employer, they withhold a portion of your paycheck to both pay your FICA taxes and cover your personal income taxes.

PROCESS FOR DETERMINING PERSONAL INCOME TAXES. To determine your personal income taxes, you must first determine your gross income, which represents all reportable income. Next, subtract any IRA contributions and interest expenses on student loans to find your adjusted gross income. Then apply any allowable deductions, depending on whether you take the standard deduction or itemize.

CALCULATING PERSONAL INCOME TAXES WHEN TAKING THE STANDARD DEDUCTION. To determine your taxable income, you have the option to take a deduction from your adjusted gross income. The standard deduction is $13,850 for single taxpayers and $27,700 for married taxpayers filing a joint return.

CALCULATING PERSONAL INCOME TAXES WHEN ITEMIZING. Rather than take the standard deduction, you can itemize to determine your personal income taxes. Itemized deductions are allowed for interest payments on mortgages, state and local tax payments (such as property taxes), unusually high medical expenses, and charitable gifts.

CONDITIONS THAT ALLOW TAX BENEFITS. Child tax credits can be applied directly to reduce your tax liability. In addition, college expense credits are available to individuals who contribute to their own or their dependents’ college education. Some college savings plans allow gains of funds invested to be exempt from taxes.

Taxpayers who incur expenses for installing solar heating or purchasing an electric vehicle are also eligible for a tax credit. There are also some types of investments that offer tax benefits in the form of either a tax exemption on the income earned or a lower tax rate applied to the gain on the investment.

TAX PLANNING WITHIN YOUR FINANCIAL PLAN. Effective tax planning may enable you to reduce your tax liability. By reducing your personal income taxes, you can increase your disposable income and, therefore, increase your net worth.
