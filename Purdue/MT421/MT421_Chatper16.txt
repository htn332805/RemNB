Chapter 16Investing in Bonds

Stephen VanHorn/Shutterstock

Noah wanted to invest in bonds because he knew that they could provide periodic interest payments that would serve as a source of income. He knew that he could buy bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. However, these bonds only offered a yield of 5%. Noah wanted to earn a higher yield. He noticed that some offered a yield of 10%, double the yield provided by Treasury bonds. He decided to invest in bonds issued by one particular company that was offering a yield of 11%. During the following year, the U.S. economy weakened, and the company could not afford to cover its debt. It filed for bankruptcy, and Noah’s bonds became worthless. Noah learned the potential adverse consequence of investing in bonds that offer an unusually high yield.

Like other investments, bonds have unique characteristics. As with stocks, the return and risk vary depending on their issuer as well as current and expected economic conditions. Understanding the different types of bonds and various bond investment strategies can help you build your own investment portfolio and enhance your wealth.

Background on Bonds
Recall that investors commonly invest some of their funds in bonds, which are long-term debt securities issued by government agencies or corporations. Bonds commonly offer more favorable returns than bank deposits. In addition, they typically provide fixed interest payments (called coupon payments) that represent additional income each year. The par value of a bond is its face value, or the amount returned to the investor at the maturity date when the bond is due.

Most bonds have maturities between 10 and 30 years, although some bonds have longer maturities. Investors provide the issuers of bonds with funds (credit). In return, the issuers are obligated to make interest (or coupon) payments and to pay the par value at maturity. When a bond has a par value of $1,000, a coupon rate of 6% means that

 is paid annually to investors. The coupon payments are normally paid semiannually (in this example, $30 every six months).

Some bonds are sold at a price below par value; in this case, investors who hold the bonds until maturity will earn a return from the difference between par value and what they paid. This income is in addition to the coupon payments earned.

You should consider investing in bonds rather than stocks if you wish to receive periodic income from your investments. As will be explained in Chapter 18, many investors diversify among stocks and bonds to achieve their desired return and risk preferences.

Bond Characteristics
Bonds that are distributed by a particular type of issuer can offer various features, such as a call feature or convertibility.

Call Feature
A call feature on a bond allows the issuer to buy back the bond from the investor before maturity. This feature is desirable for issuers because it allows them to retire existing bonds with coupon rates that are higher than the prevailing interest rates.

call feature
A feature on a bond that allows the issuer to repurchase the bond from the investor before maturity.

Investors are willing to purchase bonds with a call feature only if the bonds offer a slightly higher return than similar bonds without a call feature. This premium compensates the investors for the possibility that the bonds may be called before maturity.

Example
Five years ago, Plak, Inc., issued 15-year callable bonds with a coupon rate of 9%. Interest rates have declined since then. Today, Plak can issue new bonds at a rate of 7%. It decides to retire the existing bonds by buying them back from investors and to issue new bonds at a 7% coupon rate. By calling the old bonds, Plak has reduced its cost of financing.

Convertible Feature
A convertible bond allows the investor to convert the bond into a stated number of shares of the issuer’s stock if the stock price reaches a specified price. This feature enables bond investors to benefit when the issuer’s stock price rises. Because convertibility is a desirable feature for investors, convertible bonds tend to offer a lower return than nonconvertible bonds. Consequently, if the stock price does not rise to the specified trigger price, the convertible bond provides a lower return to investors than alternative bonds without a convertible feature. If the stock price does reach the trigger price, however, investors can convert their bonds into shares of the issuer’s stock, thereby earning a higher return than they would have earned on nonconvertible bonds.

A Bond’s Yield to Maturity
A bond’s yield to maturity is the annualized return on the bond if it is held until maturity. Consider a bond that is priced at $1,000, has a par value of $1,000, a maturity of 20 years, and a coupon rate of 10%. This bond has a yield to maturity of 10%, which is the same as its coupon rate because the price paid for the bond equals the principal.

yield to maturity
The annualized return on a bond if it is held until maturity.

As an alternative example, if this bond’s price were lower than the principal amount, its yield to maturity would exceed the coupon rate of 10%. The bond would also generate income in the form of a capital gain because the purchase price would be less than the principal amount to be received at maturity. Conversely, if this bond’s price were higher than the principal amount, its yield to maturity would be less than the 10% coupon rate because the amount paid for the bond would exceed the principal amount to be received at maturity.

Bond Trading in the Secondary Market
Investors can sell their bonds to other investors in the secondary market before the bonds reach maturity. Bond prices change in response to interest rate movements and other factors. Some bonds are traded on stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange. Other bonds are traded in over-the-counter markets. Many investors sell their bonds in the secondary market so that they can obtain funds to cover upcoming expenses or to invest in other more attractive types of securities. Brokerage firms take orders from investors to buy or sell bonds and execute the transactions for investors.
Types of Bonds
Bonds can be classified according to the type of issuer as follows:

Treasury bonds

Municipal bonds

Federal agency bonds

Corporate bonds

Treasury Bonds
Treasury bonds are long-term debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, a branch of the federal government. Because the payments are guaranteed by the federal government, they are not exposed to the risk of default by the issuer. The interest on Treasury bonds is subject to federal income tax, but it is exempt from state and local taxes. Treasury bonds are very liquid because they can easily be sold in the secondary market.

Municipal Bonds
Municipal bonds are long-term debt securities issued by state and local government agencies; these agencies generate fees from some municipal projects or use tax revenues to repay the debt. They have typically been perceived to be a safe investment, but some municipal bonds have defaulted when city municipalities filed for bankruptcy. Furthermore, there are still some local government agencies (such as in Illinois) that have very large budget deficits and might struggle to repay all the debt that they have borrowed. Before buying municipal bonds, investigate the issuer to determine if it has any pension liabilities that could cause repayment problems in the future. To entice investors, municipal bonds that are issued by a local government with a relatively high level of risk offer a higher yield than other municipal bonds with a lower level of risk.

Information about municipal bonds.

The interest on municipal bonds is exempt from federal income tax, which is especially beneficial to investors who are in a high tax bracket. The interest is also exempt from state and local taxes when the investor resides in the same state as the municipality that issued the bonds. Municipal bonds tend to have a lower coupon rate than Treasury bonds issued at the same time. However, the municipal bonds may offer a higher after-tax return to investors.

Example
Javier Rivas lives in Florida, where there is no state income tax. For federal income tax, however, he faces a 35% marginal rate, meaning that he will pay a tax of 35% on any additional income that he earns this year. Last year, Javier invested $100,000 in Treasury bonds with a coupon rate of 6% and $100,000 in municipal bonds with a coupon rate of 5%. His annual earnings from these two investments are shown here:

Interest income after taxes	$3,900	$5,000
Notice that even though Javier received more interest income from the Treasury bonds, he must pay 35% of that income to the federal government. Therefore, he keeps only 65% of that income, or a total of $3,900. In contrast, none of the interest income of $5,000 from the municipal bonds is taxed. Consequently, every year Javier receives $1,100 more in after-tax interest income from the municipal bonds with the 5% coupon rate than from the Treasury bonds with the 6% coupon rate.
Federal Agency Bonds
Federal agency bonds are long-term debt securities issued or guaranteed by federal government agencies or government-sponsored entities (GSEs). The Government National Mortgage Association (called Ginnie Mae or abbreviated GNMA), for example, guarantees mortgage-backed securities that are issued by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and by the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association (called Freddie Mac) is a GSE that commonly issues bonds and uses the proceeds to purchase conventional mortgages. Another GSE that commonly issues bonds is the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae).

Bonds issued by government agencies such as Ginnie Mae are taxed in the same way as Treasury bonds. The interest is taxed at the federal level but is exempt from state and local taxes. The interest on bonds issued by GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is subject to federal, state, and local taxes.

Corporate Bonds
Corporate bonds are long-term debt securities issued by large firms. The repayment of debt by corporations is not backed by the federal government, so corporate bonds are subject to default risk. At one extreme, bonds issued by very large and well-established corporations such as Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble Company have very low default risk because of the companies’ proven ability to generate sufficient cash flows for many years. At the other extreme, bonds issued by smaller, less stable corporations are subject to a higher degree of default risk. These bonds are referred to as high-yield bonds, or junk bonds. Many investors are willing to invest in junk bonds because they offer a relatively high rate of return. However, they are more likely to default than other bonds, especially if economic conditions are poor.

Corporate Bond Quotations
Corporate bond quotations are not as widely available as stock quotations. A few abbreviated quotations can be found in financial newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal, and financial websites provide some bond quotations. A good place to search for bond quotes is www.finra.org/marketdata. The website of the brokerage house where you purchased your bonds also may provide bond quotations. The quotations typically include the following information:

Coupon rate

Maturity

Current yield

Volume

Closing price

Net change in price from the previous trading day

To illustrate how bond quotation information can be used, review the information disclosed for Zugle Company in Exhibit 16.1. The bonds pay an annual coupon rate of 5.00%, which reflects a payment of $50 per $1,000 par value. The maturity date of these bonds is December 1, 2026. The last price at which these bonds were traded on the previous day was 100.00, which means that the bonds are selling at par value. The yield (5.00%) represents the yield that will be earned by investors who purchase the bond at the latest price and hold it until maturity. The estimated trading volume of the bonds is $4,000,000.

Return from Investing in Bonds
If you purchase a bond and hold it until maturity, you will earn the yield to maturity specified when you purchased the bond. However, as mentioned earlier, many investors sell bonds in the secondary market before they reach maturity. Because a bond’s price changes over time, your return from investing in a bond depends on the price at the time you sell it.

Impact of Interest Rate Movements on Bond Returns
Your return from investing in a bond can be highly influenced by the interest rate movements over the period you hold the bond. To illustrate, suppose that you purchase a bond at par value that has a coupon rate of 6%. After one year, you decide to sell the bond. At this time, new bonds being sold at par value are offering a coupon rate of 8%. Because investors can purchase a new bond that offers coupon payments of 8%, they will not be willing to buy your bond unless you sell it to them for less than par value. In other words, you must offer a discount on the price to compensate for the bond’s lower coupon rate.

If interest rates had declined over the year rather than increased, you would see the opposite effects. You could sell your bond for a premium above par value because the coupon rate of your bond would be higher than the coupon rate offered on newly issued bonds. Thus, interest rate movements and bond prices are inversely related. Your return from investing in bonds will be more favorable if interest rates decline over the period you hold the bonds.

Tax Implications of Investing in Bonds
When determining the return from investing in a bond, you need to account for tax effects. The interest income that you receive from a bond is taxed as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes (except for tax-exempt bonds, as explained earlier). Selling bonds in the secondary market at a higher price than the price you originally paid for them results in a capital gain. The capital gain (or loss) is the difference between the price at which you sell the bond and the initial price that you paid for it. Recall that a capital gain from an asset held one year or less is a short-term capital gain and is taxed as ordinary income. A capital gain from an asset held for more than one year is subject to a long-term capital gains tax.

Example
You purchase 10 newly issued bonds for $9,700. The bonds have a total par value of $10,000 and a maturity of 10 years. The bonds pay a coupon rate of 8%, or 
$
800
 
(

)
 per year. The coupon payments are made every six months, so each payment is $400. Exhibit 16.2 shows your return and the tax implications for four different scenarios. Notice how taxes incurred from investments in bonds depend on the change in the bond price over time and the length of time the bonds are held.

Valuing a Bond
Before investing in a bond, investors commonly determine its value using time value of money analysis. A bond’s value is determined as the present value of the future cash flows to be received by the investor, which are the periodic coupon payments and the principal payment at maturity. The present value of a bond can be computed by discounting the future cash flows (coupon payments and principal payment) to be received from the bond. The discount rate used to discount the cash flows should reflect the rate of return that you would require to invest in the bond.

Thus, the value of a bond consists of the present value of the future coupon payments, along with the present value of the principal payment. If you pay the price that is obtained by this valuation approach and hold the bond to maturity, you will earn the return that you require.

A summary of recent financial news related to the bond market, which you may want to consider before selling or buying bonds.

Example
Assume that you wish to purchase a bond that has seven years remaining until maturity, a par value of $1,000, and a coupon rate of 6% (assume the coupon payments are paid once annually at the end of the year). Assume that you are only willing to purchase this bond if you can earn a return of 8%, because you know that you can earn 8% on alternative bonds.

The coupon payment of $60 represents a seven-year annuity. The principal payment represents a single payment to you at the end of seven years. Thus, the future cash flows from holding the bond contain an annuity along with a lump sum payment. To determine the value of this bond, discount the future cash flows of the bond with the help of the present value tables in Appendix C:

If you required a higher return, then your computed present value would have been reduced, which means that the maximum price that you would be willing to pay for the bond would be lower. For example, if you required a return of 9% to purchase this bond, the present value of the bond would be $849 (verify this as an exercise). This implies that you should pay no more than $849 for the bond if you want to earn a return of at least 9%.
Risk from Investing in Bonds
Bond investors are exposed to the risk that the bonds may not provide the expected return. The main sources of risk are default risk, call risk, and interest rate risk.

Default Risk
If the issuer of the bond (a local government or a firm) defaults on its payments, investors do not receive all the coupon payments that they are owed and will not receive the principal. These bonds are subject to default risk, which represents the risk that the borrower defaults on the bond and will not repay the creditors. Treasury bonds do not contain a risk premium because they are free from default risk. Investors will only invest in a bond that is subject to default risk if it offers a higher yield than Treasury bonds to compensate for the risk. The extra yield required by investors to compensate for default risk is referred to as a risk premium.

default risk
The risk that the borrower of funds will not repay the creditors.

risk premium
The extra yield required by investors to compensate for the risk of default.

Many investors purposely invest in the riskier bonds because of the higher return offered on these bonds. However, if these bonds default, investors could lose most or all of their investment.

ECONOMIC IMPACT

The COVID-19 Pandemic and Default Risk
As the economy weakened during the COVID-19 pandemic, many firms and municipalities were unable to make payments on their bonds. Investors who purchased these bonds lost most or all of their investments. When the investors purchased these bonds, they probably viewed them as a good investment because they offered a higher rate of return than Treasury bonds. However, these investors did not anticipate the financial crisis that was triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Use of Risk Ratings to Measure the Default Risk
Investors can use ratings (provided by agencies such as Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s) to assess the risk of corporate bonds. The ratings reflect the likelihood that the issuers will repay their debt over time. The ratings are classified as shown in Exhibit 16.3.

Exhibit 16.3 Bond Rating Classes

Figure 16.3 Full Alternative Text
Investors can select the corporate bonds that fit their degree of risk tolerance by weighing the higher potential return against the higher default risk of lower-grade debt securities. The lower (weaker) the risk rating at a given point in time, the higher the yield (and risk premium) offered on a bond.
Example

Maridav/Shutterstock

Stephanie Spratt goes to a financial website and reviews today’s bond yields for bonds with a 10-year maturity, as shown in the second column:

Type of Bond	Bond Yield Offered	Risk Premium Contained within Bond Yield
Treasury bonds	6.0%	0.0%
AAA-rated corporate bonds	6.5	0.5
A-rated corporate bonds	6.8	0.8
BB-rated corporate bonds	8.0	2.0
CCC-rated corporate bonds	9.0	3.0
Based on the bond yields, she derives the risk premium for each type of bond, shown in the third column. Notice that because the Treasury bonds are risk-free, they have no risk premium. However, the other bonds have a risk premium, which is the amount by which their annualized yield exceeds the Treasury bond yield. Although the other bonds are appealing because they offer a higher yield than the Treasury bonds, they could default, causing investors to lose all of their investment.

Stephanie decides that she prefers Treasury bonds or AAA-rated bonds to other types of bonds because she believes the risk premium on the risky bonds is not enough compensation for the risk. However, at this time she has no plans to buy bonds.

Ratings are commonly lowered during weak economic conditions because risky bonds become more susceptible to default under these conditions. Some investors shift to investing in Treasury bonds when the economy weakens because they become more concerned that other types of bonds may default.

Call Risk
Bonds with a call feature are subject to call risk (also called prepayment risk), which is the risk that the bond will be called. If issuers of callable bonds choose to redeem these bonds under certain conditions, the bondholders must sell them back to the issuer.

call (prepayment) risk
The risk that a callable bond will be redeemed by the issuer.

Example
Two years ago, Christine purchased 10-year bonds that offered a yield to maturity of 7%. She planned to hold the bonds until maturity. Recently, interest rates declined and the issuer called the bonds. Christine could use the proceeds to buy other bonds, but the yield to maturity offered on new bonds is lower because interest rates have declined. The return that Christine will earn from investing in new bonds is likely to be less than the return that she would have earned if she could have retained the 10-year bonds until maturity.

Interest Rate Risk
All bonds are subject to interest rate risk, which is the risk that the bond’s price will decline in response to an increase in interest rates. A bond is valued as the present value of its future expected cash flows. Most bonds pay fixed coupon payments. If interest rates rise, investors will require a higher return on a bond. Consequently, the discount rate applied to value the bond is increased, and the market price of the bond will decline.
interest rate risk
The risk that a bond’s price will decline in response to an increase in interest rates.

Example
Three months ago, Calvin paid $10,000 for a 20-year Treasury bond that has a par value of $10,000 and a 5% coupon rate. Since then, interest rates have increased. New 20-year Treasury bonds with a par value of $10,000 are priced at $10,000 and offer a coupon rate of 7%. Thus, Calvin would earn 2 percentage points more in coupon payments from a new bond than from the bond he purchased three months ago.

He decides to sell his Treasury bond and use the proceeds to invest in the new bonds. He quickly learns that no one in the secondary market is willing to purchase his bond for the price he paid. These investors avoid his bond for the same reason that he wants to sell it: They would prefer to earn 7% on the new bonds rather than earn 5% on his bond. The only way that Calvin can sell his bond is by lowering the price to compensate for the bond’s lower coupon rate (compared to new bonds).

Impact of a Bond’s Maturity on Its Interest Rate Risk
Bonds with longer terms to maturity are more sensitive to interest rate movements than bonds with short terms remaining until they mature. To understand why, consider two bonds. Each has a par value of $1,000 and offers a 7% coupon rate, but one bond has 20 years remaining until maturity, whereas the other has only one year remaining. If market interest rates suddenly decline from 7% to 5%, which bond would you prefer to own? The bond with 20 years to maturity becomes very attractive because you could receive coupon payments reflecting a 7% return for the next 20 years. Conversely, the bond with one year remaining until maturity will provide the 7% payment only over the next year. Although the market price of both bonds increases in response to the decline in interest rates, it increases more for the bond with the longer term to maturity.

Now assume that, instead of declining, interest rates have risen from their initial level of 7% to 9%. Which bond would you prefer? Each bond provides a 7% coupon rate, which is less than the prevailing interest rate. The bond with one year to maturity will mature soon, however, so you can reinvest the proceeds at the higher interest rates at that time (assuming the rates are still high). In contrast, you are stuck with the other bond for 20 more years. Although neither bond would be very desirable under these conditions, the bond with the longer term to maturity is less desirable. Therefore, its price in the secondary market will decline more than the price of the bond with a short term to maturity.
Bond Investment Strategies
Most bond investment strategies involve investing in a diversified portfolio of bonds rather than in one bond. Diversification reduces your exposure to possible default by a single issuer. If you cannot afford to invest in a diversified portfolio of bonds, you may consider investing in a bond mutual fund with a small minimum investment (such as $1,000). Additional information on bond mutual funds is provided in Chapter 17. Whether you focus on individual bonds or bond mutual funds, the bond investment strategies summarized here apply.

Interest Rate Strategy
With an interest rate strategy, you select bonds based on interest rate expectations. When you expect interest rates to decline, you invest heavily in long-term bonds whose prices will increase the most if interest rates fall. Conversely, when you expect interest rates to increase, you shift most of your money to bonds with short terms to maturity to minimize the adverse impact of the higher interest rates.

interest rate strategy
Selecting bonds for investment based on interest rate expectations.

Investors who use the interest rate strategy may experience poor performance if their expectations about the future direction of interest rate movements are incorrect. In addition, this strategy requires frequent trading to capitalize on shifts in expectations of interest rates. Some investors who follow this strategy frequently sell their entire portfolio of bonds so that they can shift to bonds with different maturities in response to shifts in interest rate expectations. The frequent trading results in high transaction costs (in the form of commissions to brokerage firms). In addition, the high turnover of bonds may generate more short-term capital gains, which are taxed at the ordinary federal income tax rate. This rate is higher for most investors than the tax on long-term capital gains.

Passive Strategy
With a passive strategy, you invest in a diversified portfolio of bonds that are held for a long period of time. The portfolio is simply intended to generate periodic interest income in the form of coupon payments. The passive strategy is especially valuable for investors who want to generate stable interest income over time and do not want to incur costs associated with frequent trading.

A passive strategy does not have to focus on very safe bonds that offer low returns; it may reflect a portfolio of bonds with diversified risk levels. The diversification is intended to reduce the exposure to default from a single issuer of bonds. To reduce exposure to interest rate risk, a portfolio may even attempt to diversify across a wide range of bond maturities by including some bonds that will reach maturity in a few years.

Investing in a diversified portfolio of bonds that are held for a long period of time.

Maturity Matching Strategy
The maturity matching strategy involves selecting bonds that will generate payments to match future expenses. For example, parents of an 8-year-old child may consider investing in a 10-year bond so that the principal can be used to pay for the child’s college education. Alternatively, they may invest in a bond portfolio just before retirement so that they will receive annual income (coupon payments) to cover periodic expenses after retirement. The matching strategy is conservative, in that it is simply intended to cover future expenses rather than trying to outperform the bond market in general.

Summary
BACKGROUND ON BONDS. Bonds are issued to borrow long-term funds. Issuers are obligated to make interest (or coupon) payments and to pay the par value at maturity. You should consider investing in bonds rather than stocks if you wish to receive periodic income from your investments.

TYPES OF BONDS. The common issuers are the U.S. Treasury, municipalities, federal government agencies and government-sponsored entities (GSEs), and corporations.

RETURN ON BONDS. A bond’s yield to maturity is the annualized return that is earned by an investor who holds the bond until maturity. This yield is composed of interest (coupon) payments and the difference between the principal value and the price at which the bond was originally purchased. The return on a bond can differ from the yield to maturity for investors who sell the bond before maturity. The return is determined by the coupon payments received over the investment period, along with the price at which the bond was sold.

BOND VALUATION. A bond’s value is determined as the present value of the future cash flows to be received by investors. The future cash flows represent periodic coupon payments and the principal payment at maturity. The discount rate used to derive the present value of a bond reflects the required rate of return by investors. Such investors would only consider purchasing that bond if the prevailing market price of the bond is lower than the present value that they computed.

RISK OF BONDS. Bonds can be exposed to default risk, which reflects the possibility that the issuer will default on the bond payments. Some bonds are exposed to call risk, or the risk that the bond will be called before maturity. Bonds are also subject to interest rate risk, or the risk of a decline in the bond price in response to rising interest rates.

BOND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. A popular bond investment strategy is the interest rate strategy, in which bonds are selected based on the expectation of future interest rates. Another strategy is a passive strategy, in which a diversified portfolio of bonds is maintained over a period. A final bond strategy is the maturity matching strategy, in which the investor selects bonds that will mature on future dates when funds will be needed.

HOW INVESTING IN BONDS FITS INTO YOUR FINANCIAL PLAN. Investing in bonds can generate periodic income and therefore can help support your future spending or saving. In this way, investing in bonds can allow you to achieve your financial plan.
