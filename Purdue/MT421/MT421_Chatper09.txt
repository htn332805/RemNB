Melia realized that her car was facing some serious maintenance issues, so she decided to lease a new car. The monthly lease payment was $500, and she was allowed to drive 15,000 miles per year with extra miles charged at $0.25 per mile. After 18 months, however, Melia began to tire of the large monthly payment. She went back to the auto dealer to explore ending the lease early. The dealership told her that to end the lease, she must pay a substantial penalty. Melia only had two real choices: Buy the car outright or continue the lease for its three-year term. Ending the lease was not a financially attractive option.

You may be faced with a similar decision in the future. The time to make a “lease versus buy” decision is before the lease is signed or before the car is purchased. Once committed to either action, you most likely will have to remain committed to your decision.

Background on Personal Loans
Consumers commonly obtain a personal loan to finance a large purchase such as a car or a home improvement project. A personal loan is different from access to credit (from a credit card) in that a personal loan is normally used to finance one large purchase and has a specific repayment schedule. The loan is provided at the time of your purchase and is used along with your cash down payment to cover the entire purchase price. You can pay off the personal loan on an installment basis, for example, by making a payment each month for the next 48 months.

Sources of Personal Loans
The first step in obtaining a personal loan is to identify possible sources of financing and evaluate the possible loan terms. Common sources of personal loans are financial institutions, family members, and peer-to-peer lending. Before you attempt to obtain any type of loan, you should check your credit report to make sure that it does not contain any incorrect information.

Financial Institutions
The most common source of financing for a personal loan is a financial institution. Commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions provide personal loans. They pool the deposited funds that they receive from savers to create loans for borrowers.

Finance companies also provide personal loans. Some finance companies are subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers that finance car purchases.

Family Members or Friends
An alternative source of financing is one or more family members or friends. If they trust that you will repay the loan on time and in full, they may be willing to provide you with a loan that earns the same interest rate as their savings account. You could also offer to pay an interest rate on the loan that is a few percentage points above the savings rate. By borrowing funds from family and friends, you can often get a more favorable rate than financial institutions offer. The loan agreement should be in writing and signed by all parties to avoid any possible misinterpretations.

Peer-to-Peer Lending
Another source of financing, especially for those with good credit histories, is peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, which is done through online platforms. The two most important are Lending Club and Prosper, which together facilitate lending amounting to more than $1 billion per year. In P2P lending, the funds are provided by individual investors, not by financial institutions. Individuals may borrow amounts ranging from $1,000 to $50,000 at interest rates that may be lower than the interest charged by a financial institution. Although the borrower must pay a loan origination fee, it may also be less than what a financial institution would charge. Loans are issued for three- or five-year terms and require monthly payments.

To obtain a loan, you apply at a P2P lending website, which will obtain your credit report and FICO score. Your FICO score will largely determine the amount of money that you will be offered and the interest rate that you will be charged. The average FICO score for P2P borrowers is around 700. The majority of P2P borrowers use their loans to pay off existing loans from other lenders or to pay off credit card debt.

Avoiding Scams
Scammers often target people seeking personal loans online because they know that their potential customers may be worried about their financial situation and may not be as cautious as they should be when seeking a loan. You should avoid any lender that guarantees you a loan before reviewing your application or advertises with messages such as “We don’t care about your past” or “Bad credit history? No problem!” A legitimate lender will not promise you a loan until it reviews your application. Anyone who claims otherwise may be an identity thief who just wants you to fill out an application with personal information such as your Social Security number. Once you complete the application, you might not hear from the thief again. Alternatively, the fraudster may ask you to pay an upfront fee, which may be called an application fee, a document fee, or some other name. Legitimate lenders may charge an origination fee, but you are not asked to pay the fee until your application is processed and you are approved for a loan. Then the fee is generally deducted from the amount you receive. Fraudsters may ask you to pay the fee when you apply and may insist that you pay with a prepaid credit card, a wire transfer, or a money order. When you’ve paid using any of these methods, it can be almost impossible to get your money back. Another scam is to tell you that you have been approved for a loan but that you must wire money to pay for insurance before you can receive the loan amount. Needless to say, once you send the wire transfer, you do not receive the loan.

To avoid scams, check a lender’s reputation with the Better Business Bureau or your state attorney general’s office or consumer protection agency. If you are seeking a personal loan online, make sure that you are at the website of a reputable business. Often a scammer will set up a website with a name very similar to that of a legitimate business.

Background information on personal loans.

Determining Whether a Loan is Reasonable
Before pursuing a loan, you should first decide if the loan is reasonable for you. Even if you can obtain a loan, it might not be a good idea. The loan will require you to make periodic payments over time. Consider the sacrifices you may have to make as you use a portion of your monthly income to pay off the loan rather than for some other purpose, For example, a loan of $2000 to buy a used car so that you can commute to your workplace and to school may be sensible. However, a loan of $30,000 so that you can purchase a new high-performance car is questionable. Such a large loan will require very large monthly payments and might leave you with little income to cover necessities such as food or rent.

You should avoid a loan if your source of income to repay the loan is uncertain. When economic conditions are weak, job layoffs are common. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people lost their jobs and struggled to maintain their payments on personal loans. Consider the consequences of having a personal loan if there are no job opportunities. How would you repay the loan? Do you have alternative sources of funds to repay the loan?

Debt Consolidation
One reason that some people obtain personal loans is to consolidate unsecured loans such as credit card debts, medical bills, and even outstanding personal loans. Debt consolidation can simplify your financial situation and recordkeeping because you only have to pay one bill each month instead of several, and you sometimes can save money because the interest rate may be lower than the rates you were paying before on the various debts. Obtaining a personal loan is a popular way to consolidate debt, but there are several other ways such as transferring debt to a 0% or low-interest-rate credit card or obtaining a home equity loan (discussed later in this chapter). Financial institutions and finance companies offer debt consolidation loans.

Before obtaining a debt consolidation loan, make sure that it really will improve your financial situation. Sometimes the low interest rate that is offered is a “teaser rate” that lasts only for a specific period. If you don’t pay off the loan during that time, you may end up paying a higher interest rate than you were paying on your debts before obtaining the loan. In addition, you will probably have to pay origination fees and possibly other fees, which will add to the cost of the loan. Finally, note that even though your monthly payments may be smaller with a debt consolidation loan, the lower payments could occur over a longer period, so your total cost might be more than if you had simply paid off your unconsolidated debts.

Be wary of so-called debt consolidation companies. Some are legitimate finance companies that offer basic debt consolidation loans, but others are debt settlement companies that claim that they will negotiate with your creditors and persuade them to forgive part or all of your debt. Frequently, these companies charge large upfront fees, but you can generally accomplish as much as they can by calling your creditors yourself. Sometimes a company will tell you to stop paying your debts and pay the money into a special account, which it will use to negotiate with your creditors. Do not trust such advice. You may be charged fees for the administration of the account, and your creditors will charge you late fees and penalties.

The Personal Loan Process
The process of applying for a personal loan from a financial institution involves filling out an application, negotiating the loan contract, and negotiating the interest rate.

Application Process
When applying for a loan, you need to provide information from your personal balance sheet and personal cash flow statement to document your ability to repay the loan.

PERSONAL BALANCE SHEET. Recall from Chapter 2 that your financial condition is partially measured by a personal balance sheet. The personal balance sheet indicates your assets, liabilities, and net worth at a specific point in time. The assets are relevant because they may serve as possible collateral to back a loan. The liabilities are relevant because they represent your existing debts.

PERSONAL CASH FLOW STATEMENT. Your financial condition is also represented by your personal cash flow statement, as discussed in Chapter 2. This statement indicates your cash inflows and cash outflows and therefore suggests how much free cash flow you have on a periodic basis. Lenders use this cash flow information to determine whether you qualify for a loan and, if so, the maximum size of the loan for which you qualify. An individual with existing loans or credit card debt may have insufficient cash flows to cover the payments on any additional loans.

The key component of the personal cash flow statement of most prospective borrowers is their income. Lenders require income documentation, such as a Form W-2, which is a form from your employer that indicates your annual earnings, or pay stubs, which indicate your recent salary.

Loan Contract
If the lender approves your loan application, it will work with you to develop a loan contract, which specifies the terms of the loan, as agreed to by the borrower and the lender. Specifically, the loan contract identifies the amount of the loan, interest rate, repayment schedule, maturity, and collateral.

loan contract
A contract that specifies the terms of a loan, as agreed to by the borrower and the lender.

AMOUNT OF THE LOAN. The amount of the loan is based on how much the lender believes you can pay back. You should borrow only the amount that you will need, because you will be charged interest on the entire amount that you borrow.

INTEREST RATE. The interest rate is critical because it determines the cost incurred on a personal loan. It must be specified in a loan contract. More information about interest rates is provided in a later section.

LOAN REPAYMENT SCHEDULE. Personal loans are usually amortized, which means that the principal (original amount loaned out) is repaid through a series of equal payments. Each loan repayment includes both interest owed and a portion of the principal. As more of the principal is paid down, the amount of interest is reduced, and a larger portion of the payment is used to repay the principal.

amortize
To repay the principal of a loan (the original amount loaned out) through a series of equal payments. A loan repaid in this manner is said to be amortized.

MATURITY. A loan contract specifies the maturity, or life of the loan. A longer maturity for a loan results in lower monthly payments and therefore makes it easier to cover the payments each month. For example, the monthly payment on a five-year loan for $16,000 may be $100 less than the payment on a four-year loan for the same amount. With the five-year loan, however, you are in debt for an additional year, and you pay more interest over the life of the loan than you would on the four-year loan. In general, you should select a maturity on personal loans that is as short as possible, as long as you allow yourself sufficient liquidity. If you have extra funds during the time you have a loan, you should consider paying off the loan early for two reasons. First, you can reduce the total amount of interest by paying off the loan early. Second, you will be able to save the money that you would otherwise have used to make the loan payments. Before you pay off the loan early, however, you should check the loan contract to make sure that it does not impose a prepayment penalty. Lenders sometimes impose a penalty if a loan is paid off early because they are receiving less interest. When you obtain a loan, you should always ask if there is a prepayment penalty. If there is, you may want to try to negotiate to have it removed or search for other lenders.

loan maturity
With respect to a loan, the life or duration of the loan.

COLLATERAL. Collateral represents assets of the borrower (if any) that back the loan if the borrower defaults. A loan that is backed or secured by collateral is referred to as a secured loan; a loan that is not backed by collateral is an unsecured loan. In general, you will receive more favorable terms (such as a lower interest rate) on a secured loan because the lender has less to lose if the loan is not repaid.

collateral
Assets of a borrower that back a secured loan if the borrower defaults.

secured loan
A loan that is backed or secured by collateral.

unsecured loan
A loan that is not backed by collateral.

If the loan is secured, the loan agreement describes the collateral. When a loan is used to purchase a specific asset, that asset is commonly used as collateral. For example, if your purchase of a boat is partly financed, the boat will serve as collateral. That is, the lender can repossess the boat if you do not make the loan payments. Some loans are backed by assets other than those purchased with the loan. For example, a boat loan could be backed by stocks that you own.

Some personal loans are backed by the equity in a borrower’s home, and these loans are commonly referred to as home equity loans. The proceeds of the loan can be used for any purpose. Home equity loans are described later in this chapter.

Cosigning
Some borrowers are only able to obtain a personal loan if someone with a stronger credit history cosigns. The cosigner is responsible for any unpaid balance if the borrower does not repay the loan. If the borrower defaults and the cosigner does not repay the loan, the lender has the right to sue the cosigner or to try to seize that person’s assets, just as if the cosigner were the borrower. As a result, the cosigner’s credit report will be negatively affected. In addition, cosigning on a loan can restrict the amount that the cosigner is able to borrow. Therefore, you should only be willing to cosign a loan if you trust the borrower and will not need to borrow funds for yourself soon.

There are several steps you can take to protect yourself when applying for a loan. Be wary of any lenders who pursue you with high-pressure tactics. Short-term offers and up-front application fees also indicate a disreputable lender. Always make sure you understand the loan terms before signing a loan agreement. If you cannot obtain reasonable loan terms, reconsider whether you truly need a loan at this time.

More insight about your personal loan decisions. Interest Rates on Personal Loans
The three most common types of interest rates financial institutions use to measure the interest due on personal loans are the annual percentage rate, simple interest, and add-on interest.

Annual Percentage Rate
Because of the Truth in Lending Act (1969), lenders are required to disclose a standardized loan rate with directly comparable interest expenses over the life of the loan. This makes it easier for you to compare loans offered by different lenders and select the best loan. The annual percentage rate (APR) measures the finance expenses (including interest and all other expenses) on a loan annually.

annual percentage rate (APR)
A rate that measures the finance expenses (including interest and other expenses) on a loan annually.

Example
Suppose that you have a choice of borrowing $2,000 over the next year from Bank A, Bank B, or Bank C. Bank A offers an interest rate of 10% on its loan. Bank B offers an interest rate of 8% but also charges a fee of $100 at the time the loan is granted. Bank C offers an interest rate of 6% but charges a loan fee of $200 at the time the loan is granted. Exhibit 9.1 shows the APRs.

Exhibit 9.1 Measurement of the Annual Percentage Rate

*The APR is calculated by dividing the average annual finance expenses by the average annual loan balance.

Figure 9.1 Full Alternative Text
In this example, Bank A offers the lowest APR for a one-year loan. Even though its interest rate is higher, its total financing costs are lower than those charged by the other banks because it does not have any fees. Thus, the APR on its loan is equal to the interest rate charged on the loan. In contrast, the APRs on the loans provided by Banks B and C are much higher than the interest rate charged on their loans because of the fees.

Simple Interest
Simple interest is the interest computed as a percentage of the existing loan amount (or principal). It is measured using the principal, the interest rate applied to the principal, and the loan’s time to maturity (in years). The loan repayment schedule is easily determined by a computer or a calculator, or you can use various websites. If you input the loan amount, the interest rate, and the loan maturity, the loan repayment schedule will provide you with the following information:

The monthly payment

The amount of each monthly payment applied to pay interest

The amount of each monthly payment applied to pay down the loan principal

The outstanding loan balance that remains after each monthly payment

simple interest
Interest on a loan computed as a percentage of the existing loan amount (or principal).

The size of the monthly payment depends on the size of the loan, the interest rate, and the maturity. The larger the loan amount, the larger the monthly payment. The higher the interest rate, the larger the monthly payment. For a given loan amount and interest rate, the longer the period over which the loan is repaid (e.g., 36 months versus 24 months), the smaller the monthly payment. As mentioned earlier, however, the longer the maturity, the more you will pay in interest expenses.

Example
You obtain a loan of $2,000 that is based on the simple interest method with an annual interest rate of 12% (1% per month) and 12 equal monthly payments. Given this information, a computer generates the loan repayment schedule in Exhibit 9.2. Notice at the top of the exhibit that each monthly payment is $177.70. Each payment consists of an interest payment and a portion that goes to repay the loan principal. At the end of the first month, the interest owed on $2,000 based on a monthly interest rate of 1% is:
Because the total payment is $177.70 and the interest payment is $20, the remainder ($157.70) is applied to pay down the principal. The outstanding loan balance after one month is:

Outstanding Loan Balance
=
Previous Balance 
−
Principal Payment
=
$
2,000
−
$
157.70
=
$
1,842.30
At the end of the second month, the interest rate of 1% is applied to the outstanding balance to determine the interest payment:

Interest Owed
=
$
1,842.30
×
.01
=
$
18.42
This same process is followed to determine the amount of interest that is paid each month. The remainder of each payment is applied to pay off the principal. As each month passes, the outstanding loan balance is reduced, so the interest payment in the following month is reduced. The total monthly payment remains the same for all months, so the principal payment increases over time.

(monthly payment

Figure 9.2 Full Alternative Text
Add-On Interest
With the add-on interest method, the amount of the monthly payment is determined by calculating the interest that must be paid on the loan amount, adding the interest and loan principal together, and dividing by the number of payments.

add-on interest method
A method of determining the monthly payment on a loan; involves calculating interest that must be paid on the loan amount, adding together the interest and loan principal, and dividing by the number of payments.
Example
Reconsider the example in which you receive a loan of $2,000 to be repaid over one year, but now assume that you are charged 12% interest based on the add-on method. You would first determine the amount of interest that is owed by applying the annual interest rate to the loan amount:

Interest Owed
=
$
2,000
×
.12
=
$
240
Next, determine the total payment owed by adding the interest to the loan amount:

Total Payment
=
$
2,000
+
$
240
=
$
2,240
Finally, divide the total payment by the number of monthly payments:

Monthly Payment
=
$
2,240
/
12
=
$
186.67
Notice that your monthly payment with the add-on method is about $9 per month more than your payment with the simple interest method. Even though the same interest rate is used for both methods, the add-on method is more costly. The reason is that the interest payment is not reduced over time as you pay off the loan.

Car Loans
A common type of personal loan is a car loan. There are many decisions to make when you purchase a car: how much money to spend on it, what type to purchase, how to get the best price, whether to finance it or purchase it with cash, and whether to buy or lease the car. All these decisions are discussed in this chapter. The first decision is how much money to spend on a car, because this can influence all the remaining decisions about the car you’ll purchase.

How Much Money to Spend on a Car
PSYCHOLOGY of Personal Finance

The decision of how much money to spend on a car is critical because it can affect your budget as well as your lifestyle. When making this decision, carefully consider how your choices could affect your spending on other needs and your lifestyle in general.

Example
Ethan just started college and lives on campus. He spends all his time on campus or in the nearby college town, but he needs a car to get to his new part-time job. Ethan will earn about $500 per month from the job, which he hopes will cover his various college expenses over the next four years. The car dealer Ethan consults tells him that he could buy a new car for about $22,000, and he could obtain financing over a four-year period in which he would pay $500 per month. Ethan is excited about the idea of having a new car. However, the purchase of this car would use all the money he would earn from the job. He would have no money left to cover his monthly expenses, and covering those expenses was his reason for getting the job. Ethan realizes that purchasing a new car is not rational. He would be better off without the part-time job if the purchase of a car would require him to use all his income to make car payments. He decides that he will only purchase a car and keep his job if he can find a reliable car for less than $4,000. This would require about $100 in monthly payments over a four-year period, so that he could use the remaining $400 in monthly income from his job for other purposes.

College students like Ethan are often tempted to overspend on a car because credit is so easily available. Sometimes students make such a decision based on whether they can cover the monthly payment rather than on what they need. They receive immediate satisfaction from having a new car but will not feel the pain of paying off the large car loan until after the purchase. They may also face peer pressure to have a new car because their friends do. It is natural for college students, or any consumers, to assess what their peers have when making decisions. If all your friends have borrowed excessively to buy expensive cars, you may think that this is normal spending behavior and neglect to consider how it might constrain other forms of spending.

Consider How Your Decision Affects Your Personal Budget
Before buying an expensive new car, consider how large monthly car payments would affect your personal cash flow statement (explained in Chapter 2). If you do not have money saved to buy the car, and your car payment would be $500 per month, identify all the purchases in your typical monthly budget that you would no longer be able to make. You might need to cancel your spring break vacation, stop going out to restaurants, and stop going to movies. Alternatively, you might need to move into a smaller apartment so that you could reduce your rent expense to be able to make your car payment. Given all these sacrifices, you may decide not to buy a new car so that you have spending money to enjoy life in other ways.

Adding Credit Card Debt to Car Loan Debt
Some consumers might consider purchasing a new car with a car loan while continuing their other spending by using credit cards and making only the minimum required payments on the cards each month. This solution provides immediate satisfaction because it initially allows them to buy a new car while living a lifestyle beyond what they can afford. However, they will have to sacrifice in the future when the debt accumulates and they have to pay it off. They not only will have the burden of the large car payment every month for the next four years but also will have to make large payments to cover credit card debt. They will also pay high interest rates on their credit card debt.

Selling the New Car to Solve the Debt Problem
Some consumers who overspend on a car might believe that if they later realize that they cannot afford to make the monthly car payments, they could easily correct the situation by selling their car. However, this solution is limited. New cars lose at least 10% and sometimes as much as 20% of their value as soon as they are driven off the car dealer’s lot. Consider the new car that Ethan could have purchased for $22,000 with borrowed money in the example presented earlier. If Ethan purchased the car and tried to sell it a month later, he might receive about $18,000, or $4,000 less than what he owed on the car. In other words, the use of the new car for one month cost him $4,000. The point here is that consumers should not rush into purchasing a new car until they have carefully considered whether they can afford it.

The No-Debt Solution
Some consumers avoid the debt problems described earlier by limiting the amount of money they will spend on a car (or on any purchases) to whatever they can afford to pay with cash. This strategy forces them to purchase an inexpensive used car when they are younger because that is all that they can afford. In addition to avoiding debt, this approach might allow them to save much more of their income over time, because they can save some or all the money each month that they would have needed to make debt payments. This may enable them to save enough money so that they can purchase a new car with cash. Their decision to stay within a limited budget at an early age may be easier to accept when they realize that it will allow them to spend more money in the future.

The Limited-Debt Solution
There are many variations of the no-debt solution that are not as extreme but still very effective. Some consumers might use cash to purchase a used car and use credit cards for other purchases, but they may limit these purchases to what they can afford to pay off when they receive the credit card bill each month. In this way, they avoid the accumulation of debt. Alternatively, some consumers might be willing to borrow to purchase a car but may choose a short-term loan so that they can pay it off quickly. The payments on a short-term loan (such as one year) would be much higher than the payments on a four-year car loan, so this would reduce the amount that they could spend on the car. However, this restriction might be beneficial because it prevents them from overspending on the car.

Once you have decided how much money you will spend on a car, you can focus on the other related decisions, which are discussed next.

Selecting the Car
When selecting a car, consider the following factors.

Personal Preferences
Determine the car that fits your needs. Do you want a small car that is easy to park and gets good gas mileage? Or do you need a minivan to hold your children and their sports equipment? If you are concerned about the environment, you may want to consider an electric car or a hybrid that combines a gas engine with an electric battery. Although electric cars and hybrids generally cost more than a similar gas engine model, you will save on gasoline costs. Federal tax credits may be available, and many states have incentive programs that can lower the cost. You can always screen the cars on your list further by deciding on the size of the engine.

Price
While you have already determined the amount that you are willing to spend, you should compare the prices of the cars that fit your preferences and are within your price range. There will likely be more than one car within your price range that could satisfy your needs and preferences, and one of these cars might have a lower price because the dealer has a larger inventory of that car and so is more willing to sell it at a lower price.

Condition
When buying a used car, be sure to assess the condition of the car, beginning with the exterior. Has some of the paint worn off? Is there rust? Are the tires in good shape? Are the tires worn on one side (which may indicate that a wheel alignment is needed)? Next, check the interior. Are the seats worn? Do the electric devices work? Now look under the hood. Is there any sign of leaks? If you are still seriously considering the vehicle, ask to see the repair and maintenance records. Has the car been properly maintained and serviced over time? Has the oil been changed periodically? Most used car dealers subscribe to a vehicle history service such as Carfax or AutoCheck that will indicate whether a car has been in a major accident and has been repaired. Ask the dealer for the car’s history. You can also obtain the car’s history yourself, but you will have to pay a fee.

Estimates of the cost of a new or used car based on the car’s features and options that you specify.

All these checks can help you assess a car’s condition, but none replaces the expertise of a qualified mechanic. The cost of having a mechanic evaluate the car is worthwhile because it may enable you to avoid buying a car that will ultimately require large repair expenses.

You should also check to see if a car has any unrepaired conditions that are subject to a recall. In recent years, for example, many makes and models of cars have been recalled to deal with defective airbags, which can be dangerous if not replaced. You can learn whether a car is subject to a recall by going to www.safercar.gov and entering the car’s vehicle identification number (VIN). If there are recall notices, ask the mechanic to determine if the condition has been repaired.
Another consideration is whether a car has been in a flood. After disastrous floods such as occur in a hurricane, cars that were flooded are often quickly cleaned up and shipped out of state to be sold where buyers may not think to inquire about flood damage, which can require costly repairs. You can search for a car’s VIN in the database maintained by the National Insurance Crime Bureau, which will list any car on which an insurance claim for flood damage was paid. However, if the car was not insured, it will not be in the database. In purchasing any car, you should search for signs of water damage or the smell of disinfectant used to combat mold. A mechanic can check for signs that water has entered the various fluids in the car or damaged the electrical system.

The Federal Trade Commission’s Used Car Rule requires dealers to post a buyer’s guide in every used car offered for sale (a few states require their own similar guide). The guide must tell you whether the car is being sold “as is” or with a warranty and what percentage of the repair costs the dealer will pay under the warranty if there is one. If the buyer’s guide indicates that there is a warranty, the dealer must give you a written warranty indicating what the warranty covers.

Insurance
Some cars are subject to significantly higher insurance costs because they are more difficult to repair after accidents, are higher priced, or are common theft targets. Obtain insurance estimates on any car before making the purchase. Be aware that to obtain a loan to purchase a car, you will have to have insurance to cover the car.

Resale Value
Some cars have a much higher resale value than others. Although you cannot perfectly predict the future resale value of a car, you can look at today’s resale value of similar cars that were sold years ago. Numerous sites on the Internet, such as www.edmunds.com, provide the market values of used cars, which you can use to determine the resale value as a proportion of the original sales price.

Some cars are subject to much higher repair bills than others. To compare potential repair expenses, review Consumer Reports magazine, which commonly estimates the typical repair expenses for various cars.

Financing Rate
If you plan to finance your car purchase through the car dealer, you should compare financing rates among dealers. One dealer may charge a lower price for the car but charge higher financing costs for the loan. Other dealers may offer an unusually low financing rate but charge a higher price for the car.

Recall that in Chapter 1, Stephanie Spratt had graduated college and started a full-time job. It has been about one year since she started that job, and she has saved enough money to afford a down payment on a new car. She considers which car to buy based on the following criteria:

PRICE. Because Stephanie hopes to buy a home within a few years (which will require another loan), she wants to limit the amount she borrows now for a new car. Stephanie considers only small and inexpensive but safe new cars. She uses the Internet to identify five cars that are within her price range.

RESALE VALUE, REPAIR EXPENSES, AND INSURANCE. Stephanie also uses the Internet to obtain ratings on the resale value, safety record, repair expenses, and insurance rates for each of the five cars. She inputs information about her salary and her credit score on car financing websites and is quickly able to determine the financing rate she would pay.

Using the Internet, Stephanie easily obtains the information shown in Exhibit 9.3 Car A has a relatively low resale value after two years. Car D has relatively high repair expenses and service maintenance. Cars A and C have relatively high insurance rates. Therefore, she eliminates Cars A, C, and D. She will choose between Cars B and E.

Exhibit 9.3 Stephanie Spratt’s Car Analysis

Negotiating the Price
When shopping for a car, you have a choice between dealers that negotiate and dealers that offer one set price for a specific car to all customers. Any dealer that negotiates will purposely price its cars well above the price for which it is willing to sell the car. For example, the dealer may initially quote a price that represents the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP). This price is also referred to as the sticker price. The strategy of some dealers is to make you think that you are getting a great deal as a result of the negotiations. If any customer is naïve enough to pay the full price, the car dealer earns a much larger profit at the customer’s expense.

The salespeople are trained to act as if they are almost giving the car away to the customer by reducing the price by 5% to 20%. During the negotiations, they will say that they must discuss the price you offer with the sales manager. They already know the price at which they can sell the car to you, but this creates the appearance that they are pleading with the sales manager. During the negotiations, the dealer may offer you “free” rustproofing, a DVD system, leather seats, or other features. These features are usually priced very high to make you believe that you are getting a good deal.

If you intend to purchase a new car, consider ordering it if you don’t see what you want on the dealer’s lot. The cars on the lot may have many features that you don’t want. Thus, they will have a higher price. Sometimes, however, dealers want to sell their current inventory to make room for new models; in that case, you may be able to negotiate a better price.
Negotiating by Phone
When purchasing a new car, it may be beneficial to negotiate by phone. After deciding on the type of car that you want, call a dealer and describe the car and options you desire. Explain that you plan to call other local car dealers and that you will select the dealer that offers the lowest price. You may also want to emphasize that you will only call each dealer once.

Some dealers may not have the exact car that you want, so you may still have to compare features. For example, one dealer may quote a price that is $200 lower than the next-lowest quote, but the car may not be the color you requested. Nevertheless, the process described here can at least minimize the negotiation process.

Trade-In Tactics
If you are trading a car in, some dealers will pay a relatively high price for your trade-in but charge a high price for the new car. For example, they may pay you $500 more than your used car is worth, but then charge you at least $500 more than they would have charged for the new car if you did not have a car to trade in. Attempt to negotiate the price of the new car before even mentioning that you have a car to trade in.

If you purchase a car from a typical dealer, many of the salespeople will congratulate you as if you had just won the lottery. This is also part of their strategy to make you feel that you got a great deal.

No-Haggle Dealers
Some car dealerships advertise that they do not haggle on the price. They set one price for a car, so you do not have to prepare for a negotiating battle. Buying a car from these dealers is not only less stressful but also far less time-consuming. Some of these car dealerships still negotiate, however, so before you buy the car, you should make sure the price is no higher than that quoted by other dealers.

The Value of Information
Some car dealers attempt to make a higher profit from customers who are not well informed about the price that they should pay for a car. One way to avoid being taken advantage of when purchasing a car is to be informed. Shop around and make sure that you know the typical sales price for the car you want. You can obtain this information from Consumer Reports and various websites that will provide you with a quote based on the car model and features you want. You can do all your shopping from your computer or your smartphone. For example, you may be able to obtain the dealer invoice price, which is the price that the dealer pays the manufacturer for the car. The difference between the price quoted by the dealer and the invoice price is the dealer markup. Be aware that manufacturers commonly provide dealers a rebate (referred to as a holdback), but dealers do not normally provide this information to their customers. A dealer could charge a price that is only $200 above its dealer invoice, but if it received an $800 rebate from the manufacturer, the price is really marked up $1,000.

Purchasing a Car Online
You can buy a car online directly from some car manufacturers or from car referral services such as Autobytel. Car referral services forward your price quotation request to specific dealerships, which then respond by sending you a quote. CarsDirect at www.carsdirect.com provides you with quotes based on deals it has made with various dealerships. That is, it receives guarantees from some dealerships on the prices for various types of cars. When a customer requests a quote, the car-buying service provides quotations that include a markup for its service. In other words, it is serving as the middleman between you and the dealership. If a customer agrees to the price, the car-buying service instructs one of its dealerships to deliver the car.

Buying a new car online is not as efficient as buying an airline ticket or a book online. A car is not as standardized as a book, and the many options available can make online correspondence more difficult. At a dealership, a customer can see the actual difference in the design of two models of a particular car. It is not as easy to detect the differences on a website. Unlike a website, a dealership can anticipate your questions and arrange for a test drive. It is also more difficult to force an online service to meet its delivery promise to you. For example, an online car seller may guarantee you a price for a specific car, but not necessarily meet the delivery date. You have limited ability to enforce the deal because you may only be able to reach them by e-mail or voicemail. You can place more pressure on a local dealership to meet its promise by showing up at the dealership and expressing your concerns.

You can also buy used cars online through eBay and other websites. However, the purchase of a used car online is subject to the same limitations as the purchase of a new car online. Given the limitations of buying a car online, many customers still prefer to buy a car at a dealership.

Example

Maridav/Shutterstock
Stephanie Spratt has decided to use the Internet to shop for her car. Several websites state the price for each of the two new cars she is considering (Cars B and E from the previous example). She reviews specific details about each car, including which car has more value relative to its price, the options, available colors, and the delivery dates. She believes that although Car B is cheaper, its value will depreciate more quickly than Car E’s. In addition, she can get the exact options and color she desires for Car E, and it can be delivered soon. She is almost ready to purchase Car E, which is priced at $21,000 including taxes. But first, she wants to consider the financing costs per month and whether to lease the car or purchase it.

Financing Decisions
If you are considering purchasing a new car and plan to finance the purchase, you should estimate the dollar amount of the monthly payment. By evaluating your typical monthly cash inflows and outflows, you can determine whether you can afford to make the required payments to finance the car. You should conduct the estimate before shopping for a car so that you know how much you can afford. The more money needed to cover the car payments, the less you can add to your savings or other investments.

Example

Stephanie Spratt recognizes that if she made a larger down payment, she could reduce the amount of her car loan. However, she wants to retain some of her savings to maintain liquidity and to use for a future down payment on a house. She decides to use $4,000 for a down payment and borrow $17,000 to purchase the new car. She must also decide whether to repay the loan over three years, four years, or five years.

Stephanie goes to a car-financing website where she is asked to input the approximate amount she will borrow. The website then provides the available interest rate and shows the payments for each alternative loan maturity, as shown in Exhibit 9.4. The interest rate of 6.0% at the top of the exhibit is a fixed rate that would be available to Stephanie, as she has an excellent credit score.

Exhibit 9.4 Stephanie Spratt’s Loan Maturity Options for a Loan of $17,000 at a 6% Interest Rate

Figure 9.4 Full Alternative Text
Notice how the payment decreases if Stephanie extends the loan period. If she borrows $17,000, her payment would be $517 for a three-year loan, $400 for a four-year loan, or $329 for a five-year loan.

Stephanie selects the $17,000 loan with a four-year term and a $400 monthly payment. The four-year term is preferable because the monthly loan payment for a three-year term is higher than she wants to pay.

Extended Financing Period
Some auto dealerships provide financing for up to seven years. The advantage of such a long period to repay the loan is that for a given loan amount, your monthly payment will be lower. While extending a car loan period results in lower monthly payments, it will increase the total payments that you make on the loan. In addition, the disadvantage of such a long period is that by the time you pay off the loan, the car may be worth a lot less. Even if you sell the car after a few years, the car is likely to be worth less than the amount you still owe on the car. Conversely, if you pay off a car loan in a short amount of time, you are relieved of car payments until you purchase another car.

Zero Percent Financing
Some auto dealerships will also provide zero percent financing, which appears to be a very appealing offer. However, consider the selling price of the car as well when comparing an auto dealership that offers zero percent financing to another auto dealership that charges interest on its financing. In most cases, the auto dealership that offers zero percent financing will set a higher price for the car. You can compare the monthly payments that you would pay between the two dealerships, assuming the cars and the financing period are the same.

Recall that in the previous example, Stephanie Spratt plans to make a $4,000 down payment on a car priced at $21,000 and pay $400 per month for her $17,000 car loan. Imagine if she was given a zero percent financing offer from a different auto dealership for the same type of car, but that car was priced at $24,000. After applying her $4,000 down payment, her monthly payment on a four-year car loan of $20,000 with a 0% interest rate would be $417, which is higher than the monthly payment she will make with her 6% car loan.

The Sports Car Dilemma
One of the most desirable purchases for some college students is a new sports car. Auto dealerships make these purchases possible by being willing to finance much of the purchase price. You may have friends who have sports cars who try to convince you to buy one, too. The first column of Exhibit 9.5 presents common arguments that may be offered by your friends.

Exhibit 9.5 Arguments for and Against Buying a New Sports Car While in College

Figure 9.5 Full Alternative Text
Buying a sports car provides an immediate thrill, but that thrill might quickly wear off for college students who have to make many sacrifices to afford the car. These might include spending $600 per month for the next seven years on car payments, working more hours to afford the payments, slowing down their progress toward their college degree, and giving up other forms of recreation.

Furthermore, the maintenance and gasoline expenses associated with a sports car are typically higher than for other cars. The replacement of parts of a sports car (including tires) is more expensive than the replacement of parts on other cars, and the cost of insuring a sports car is about 30% higher on average than the cost of insuring other cars.

Many college students who purchase a new sports car with borrowed funds never recover from the large debt that they accumulate. They are often unable or unwilling to work more hours and are also unable to sufficiently reduce their monthly expenses to afford the car payments. Because they are using a large portion of their income to cover the car payment each month, they might rely on credit cards (as discussed in Chapter 7) to cover most of their other expenses. They might not feel the pain immediately if they make the minimum monthly payment on their credit card, but their credit card debt will grow quickly, as the interest rate on that credit may be 20% or more.

This scenario sometimes forces students to make drastic adjustments in their lifestyle to get control of their debt, such as dropping out of college to be able to work more hours. That decision can have a major adverse impact on their long-term careers. They might sell their sports car once these sacrifices become overwhelming, but the financial impact of the decision will remain because the value of sports cars typically depreciates quickly over time; the cars are sold at a steep discount in the used car market.

This situation can be avoided by considering the potential adverse financial effects before purchasing a new sports car. If you have the patience to defer such a major purchase until after you have started your career and saved a large amount of money, you will likely enjoy your sports car to a greater degree Purchase or Lease Decision
A popular alternative to buying a car is leasing one. An advantage of leasing is that you do not need a substantial down payment. In addition, you return the car to the car dealer at the end of the lease period, so you do not need to worry about finding a buyer for the car. Furthermore, you will always be driving a relatively new car.

Leasing a car also has disadvantages. Because you do not own the car, you have no equity investment in it, even though the car still has value. You are also responsible for maintenance costs while you are leasing it. Keep in mind that you will be charged for any damage to the car over the lease period. Note, too, that if you always lease another car when the lease period ends, you will be making lease payments indefinitely and will never actually own a car. Constantly leasing a car is almost always more expensive than purchasing a car. Some car dealers impose additional charges beyond the monthly lease payments. You will be charged if you drive more than the maximum number of miles specified in the lease agreement. You may be assessed a fee if you end the lease before the period specified in the contract. You may also have to purchase more car insurance than you already have. Some of these charges may be hidden within the lease agreement. Thousands of customers have filed legal claims, alleging that they were not informed of all possible charges when they leased a car. If you ever seriously consider leasing, make sure that you read and understand the entire lease agreement.

Maridav/Shutterstock

Stephanie Spratt now wonders if she should lease the car she is considering rather than purchasing it for $21,000. She wants to analyze the financial details of each possible option.

If Stephanie purchases the car, she can invest $4,000 as a down payment today and finance the remaining $17,000 with a car loan. She will pay $400 per month over four years to cover the financing. She expects that the car will be worth $10,000 at the end of four years. By purchasing instead of leasing, she forgoes interest that she could have earned from investing the $4,000 down payment over the next four years. If she invested those funds in a bank, she believes she would earn 4% annually after considering taxes paid on the interest.

Alternatively, she could lease the same car for $350 per month over the four-year period. The lease would require a $1,000 security deposit, which she would receive back at the end of the four years. However, she would forgo interest she could have earned if she had invested the $1,000 instead. And, at the end of a lease, she would have no car.

Stephanie’s comparison of the cost of purchasing versus leasing is shown in Exhibit 9.6. Stephanie estimates the total cost of purchasing the car to be $13,840 over the next four years, while the total cost of leasing over the next four years is $16,960. Therefore, she decides to purchase the car.

Exhibit 9.6 Stephanie Spratt’s Comparison of the Cost of Purchasing versus Leasing a Car
Figure 9.6 Full Alternative Text
The decision to purchase versus lease a car is highly dependent on the estimated market value of the car at the end of the lease period. If the expected value of the car in the previous example were $6,000 instead of $10,000 after four years, the total cost of purchasing the car would have been $4,000 more. Substitute $6,000 for $10,000 in Exhibit 9.6 (in the row indicating the expected amount to be received when the car is sold) and recalculate the cost of purchasing to verify this. If Stephanie’s car has an expected market value of $6,000 in four years, the estimated total cost of purchasing the car would have been $17,840, so leasing would have been preferable.

The accuracy of your analysis of purchasing versus leasing is highly dependent on your estimate of the market value of your car when you plan to sell it. There are some websites run by specialists in the appraisals of used cars (such as Edmunds) that provide an online free immediate estimate of the typical depreciation for any car. You could use this information and then adjust the estimate based on how well you take care of your car over time.

Simplified Analysis of the Purchase versus Lease Decision
While the measurement of the opportunity costs allows your analysis to be more accurate, it normally would not affect the conclusion of your analysis. Thus, a simplified analysis would be to (1) add the down payment plus total monthly car loan payments and then subtract the expected market value of the car at the end of the period to derive a rough estimate of the cost of purchasing a car, and (2) determine the total monthly lease payments over the lease period.

In the previous example, this simplified approach would produce the following results:

ESTIMATED COST OF PURCHASING CAR

Down payment $4,000

+
 Total monthly car payments
+
$
19,200

−

Student Loans
The largest personal loan for many students is the student loan, which is a loan to finance a portion of a student’s expenses while pursuing an undergraduate or graduate degree. About 70% of students graduate with at least some student loan debt. Based on data from the Federal Reserve, there are about 44 million U.S. citizens with outstanding student loans. For that group, the average level of debt is about $24,000, but the distribution is widely scattered. About 26% of those with student loans have debt of less than $10,000; 34% have debt between $10,000 and $30,000; 15% have debt between $30,000 and $50,000, and the remaining 25% have debt above $50,000.

student loan
A loan provided to finance part of the expenses a student incurs while pursuing a degree.

The total value of student debt is estimated to be about $1.6 trillion. Financing a college education has become much more common over time, which is why the outstanding debt of student loans is especially high among recent college graduates and students who are still in college. Loans are often provided as part of a financial aid package that includes scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study programs. The components of financial aid packages vary considerably among colleges, making it difficult to determine which package is the best offer. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a comparison tool that can help you compare multiple financial aid offers.

Types of Student Loans
There are two types of student loans: federal loans, which are provided by the U.S. government, and private loans, which are provided by financial institutions. There are four main types of federal student loans:

Direct subsidized loans, which are based on financial need

Direct unsubsidized loans, which are not based on financial need, so everyone is eligible

Direct PLUS loans, which are made to graduate students and parents of dependent undergraduates to help pay expenses not covered by other financial aid

Direct consolidation loans, which allow you to combine all of your federal student loans into one loan

An important difference between subsidized and unsubsidized loans is that the government pays the interest on the subsidized loans while you are in school. For unsubsidized loans, interest is charged while you are in school and is added to your loan balance. For most students, federal loans are preferable to private loans because the interest rate generally is lower, and it is fixed, not variable. In addition, federal student loans allow you to enroll in a repayment plan based on your income, an option that is not available with private loans. The amount of money available through government loans is limited, however, and many students find that they also need to obtain private loans.

You can borrow larger amounts of money with private loans than with federal loans, but private loans are also generally more expensive. Private loans usually charge a higher interest rate than federal loans, and interest is charged while you are in school just as it is for federal unsubsidized loans. In addition, these loans often have a variable interest rate, so your monthly payment could increase over time if market interest rates rise. Conversely, if you have outstanding federal loans at a fixed interest rate and interest rates fall, the variable rate on private loans may be lower than the rate on your federal loans. In that case, you may want to consider refinancing your federal loans as a private loan. Be careful in switching to a private loan, however, because interest rates may rise again. In addition, private loans are not eligible for loan forgiveness and other beneficial loan repayment programs. When considering a private loan, it is worth shopping around because the terms of private loans vary considerably among lenders. Most lenders require that undergraduates have a cosigner for the loan.

Repaying Student Loans
Even if you don’t graduate from college, you still have to pay back your student loans; not doing so will damage your credit history. The interest is tax deductible up to a maximum of $2,500, but the tax benefits are phased out for individuals in higher tax brackets. In certain circumstances, loan recipients who pursue occupations in some public service jobs might receive partial loan forgiveness after making loan payments over a period such as 10 years.

If you find yourself in a situation where you cannot repay your loans, you can ask your lender for a deferment or forbearance, which means that your payments are temporarily delayed. Deferment and forbearance are similar, although deferment is generally preferable because it is available for longer periods and interest will not be charged on your subsidized federal loans. Deferments are often granted for situations such as active duty in military service, reenrollment in school, or unemployment. Forbearance may be granted for a medical issue or temporary financial difficulties. Private lenders may not offer deferment and forbearance options, although some do. During both deferment and forbearance, interest will continue to be charged on private loans and unsubsidized federal loans. It will be added to your principal, so a long period of deferment or forbearance could substantially increase the amount that you will ultimately have to repay.

If your federal loan repayments are very high relative to your income, you can apply for Income-Based Repayment, or IBR (also known as Income-Driven Repayment, or IDR). This program offers four plans that call for repayment periods of 20 to 25 years. Your monthly payment is set at an amount intended to be affordable based on your income and family size. If your income and/or family size change, your payment is readjusted. At the end of the repayment period, any remaining loan balance is forgiven. You may have to pay income tax on the amount that is forgiven. Although IBR lowers your monthly payment, the payment period is extended, so you usually pay more in interest under this program.
When you are taking out student loans, you should also be aware that, unlike other types of debt, student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy except in very rare circumstances. Thus, unless you fit into one of the few exceptions, you will have to repay all the money that you borrow with interest. Note that if you default on your student loans without obtaining a deferment or forbearance, the entire loan amount becomes due.

Student loan programs can be quite complex because there are so many types of loans and repayment plans. You should investigate the options carefully before taking out loans. Your school’s financial aid office can be a good source of information. Several U.S. government websites can also be helpful: www.ed.gov and www.studentaid.gov (both from the Department of Education) and www.consumerfinance.gov (the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau).

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Student Loan Repayment
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with student loans provided by the Department of Education were allowed to discontinue their loan payments from March 2020 until September 2023. The interest did not accrue during this period. However, interest began to accrue again as of September 1, 2023, and payments on student debt resumed in October 2023.

Many commercial banks and financial institutions that provided student loans also allowed individuals to extend their loan period without penalty so that they could more easily repay their loans. Student loans provided by private sources are subject to the policies of the private lenders.

In 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic, 17% of people with student loan debt were behind on their payments. During the 3.5-year pause on payments, the percentage could not increase because no payments were required. Yet a recent estimate suggests that 12% of people with student loan debt are now behind on payments. Thus, the pause on student loan payments for 3.5 years allowed some people who were behind to catch up on their payments. About 17% of students who completed less than an associate’s degree were behind on their payments versus only about 5% of students who completed their bachelor’s degree.

Student Loan Debt Forgiveness
In October 2023, the U.S. government announced that it will forgive about $9 billion in federal loans that were provided to about 126,000 students. The Department of Education stated that these loans will be forgiven to correct some bureaucratic obstacles. Specifically, three types of borrowers will receive debt relief:

About 53,000 borrowers who were eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness programs will receive relief. These programs waive debt for college graduates who pursue public service jobs such as teachers, police officers, and social workers and who make debt payments for 10 years.

About 51,000 borrowers who made at least 20 years of payments but were subject to what the U.S. government referred to as administrative failures will receive relief.

About 22,000 borrowers who have a total or permanent disability will receive relief.

These decisions could face legal challenges in the future. Monitor the Department of Education website (www.ed.gov) for further updates.
Home Equity Loans
One of the most popular types of personal loans is a home equity loan, which allows homeowners to borrow against the equity in their home. The home serves as collateral to back the loan. The borrowed funds can be used for any purpose, including a vacation, tuition payments, health care expenses, or debt consolidation.

home equity loan
A loan where the equity in a home serves as collateral for the loan.

Home equity is determined by subtracting the amount owed on the home from its market value. If a home has a market value of $100,000 and the homeowner has a mortgage loan (discussed in Chapter 10) with a balance of $60,000, the home equity value is $40,000.

home equity
The market value of a home minus the debt owed on the home.

There are two ways to borrow against your home’s equity. With a simple home equity loan, you receive the money you are borrowing in a lump sum. The loan usually will have a fixed interest rate. With a home equity line of credit (HELOC), the lender provides you with a line of credit that you can draw against over a period, such as 10 years. That is, the HELOC allows you to borrow various amounts up to a specific credit limit. Some plans require you to borrow a minimum amount, such as $300, each time you draw on the line of credit or to keep a certain balance outstanding. You may also be required to make an initial withdrawal when the HELOC is set up. HELOCs typically have variable interest rates, but you pay interest only on the amount of funds that you borrow. You can typically pay the interest owed per month on the amount you borrow and then pay the principal at a specified maturity date. You may also be allowed to pay off the principal before the HELOC’s term ends and still have access to the funds if you need them in the future.

Setting up either type of home equity loan will entail fees in addition to the interest charged. These fees may include an appraisal fee so that the lender can determine the value of the home, an application fee that may not be refunded even if your loan request is turned down, up-front charges that may amount to 2% or 3% or more of the credit limit, and closing costs including fees for attorneys and a title search. In addition, some HELOC plans charge annual maintenance fees or transaction fees whenever you draw on the line of credit.

More information about home equity loans.

Credit Limit on a Home Equity Loan
Financial institutions provide home equity loans of up to 80% (or more in some cases) of the value of the equity in a home.

Financial institutions define the market value of your equity as the market value of your home minus the mortgage balance (amount still owed on the home). When the market value of a home rises, they are willing to provide more credit than if the market value remains the same.

If you default on a home equity loan, the lender can claim your home, use a portion of the proceeds to pay off the mortgage, and use the remainder to cover your home equity loan. If the market price of the home declines, the equity that you invested is reduced. For this reason, lenders do not like to lend the full amount of the equity when extending a home equity loan.

The following example illustrates how to determine the maximum amount of credit that can be provided on a home equity loan.

Example
Suppose that you own a home worth $100,000 that you purchased four years ago. You initially made a down payment of $20,000 and took out an $80,000 mortgage. Over the last four years, your mortgage payments have added $10,000 in equity. Thus, you have invested $30,000 in the home, including your $20,000 down payment. Assume that the home’s market value has not changed. Also, assume that a creditor is willing to provide you with a home equity loan of 70% based on the market value of equity in the home. In this example, the market value of equity is equal to the amount of equity you invested in the home. Impact of the Economy on the Credit Limit
When the economy improves, job opportunities improve, consumers receive more income, and they increase their demand for homes. The market values of homes rise in response to the strong demand. As the market value of a home rises while the existing debt on the home mortgage has not changed, the home equity value rises.

ECONOMIC IMPACT

However, when the economy weakens, there are fewer job opportunities, consumers receive less income, and they reduce their demand for homes. The market values of homes decline in response to the weak demand. As the market value of a home declines, while the existing debt on the home mortgage has not changed, the home equity value decreases. In many cases, the market value of the home may decline below the mortgage balance, which means that there is no equity in the home. Consequently, there is no collateral that could be used to back a loan, so homeowners can not obtain a home equity loan.

Interest Rate on a Home Equity Loan
A home equity line of credit typically has a variable interest rate that is tied to a specified interest rate index that changes periodically (such as every six months). The loan contract specifies how the interest rate will be determined. For example, it may be set equal to the average deposit rates across financial institutions within a particular district plus three percentage points. Because the home serves as collateral for the loan, the lender faces less risk than with an unsecured loan so the interest rate is lower.  Payday Loans
A payday loan (also called a cash advance loan) is a short-term loan provided to you if you need funds in advance of receiving your paycheck. To obtain a payday loan, you write a check to the lender for the amount of the loan plus the interest. You date the check for the date in the future when you will receive your paycheck. The payday loan firm will hold the check until that time and will cash it then because your checking account will have sufficient funds. After you provide this check to the payday loan firm, it provides you with your loan in cash or by transmitting funds into your checking account. You can also obtain a payday loan online. Instead of providing the lender with a postdated check, you give the lender permission to electronically withdraw money from your bank account. Be aware that firms such as King of Kash, Cash 1, Checkmate, and EZLoans, which provide payday loans, charge a high rate of interest on these short-term loans.

Example
Assume that you need $400 for some immediate purpose, but will not have any money until you receive your paycheck one week from today. You go to a payday loan firm, which requests that you provide them a check, dated one week from today, for $440, which reflects the loan of $400 and $40 interest and/or fees. You are paying $40 more than the loan you received, which reflects 10% of the loan amount. The cost of financing a payday loan is as follows:

(

)
=

%
×
(

/

)
=
521
%
This is not a misprint. It is within the typical range of the cost of financing charged for payday loans.

Although states have usury laws that place a limit on the maximum interest rate that can be charged, payday loan firms circumvent that limit by referring to the interest as fees. Some states prevent payday firms from establishing businesses. However, payday loan firms based in the states that allow them can still reach residents in any state via the Internet.

Reasons to Avoid Payday Loans
You should avoid payday loans for the following reasons. First, by using your next paycheck to cover a loan payment, you may not have sufficient cash available to make normal purchases after covering the loan. Thus, you may need another loan to cover your purchases in that period, and this can create a continual cycle in which your paycheck is always needed to repay short-term loans.

Second, the cost of financing with a payday loan is outrageous. The payday loan firms can charge excessive rates because some people who need money quickly may not be creditworthy and therefore have difficulty obtaining funds from other sources. Alternatively, some borrowers do not realize how high the cost of financing is when they borrow money from a payday loan firm.

Alternatives to Payday Loans
The simple solution is to avoid borrowing money until you have the funds to spend. But if you have to borrow, there are alternative ways of financing that are not as expensive. For example, perhaps you can borrow funds from a friend or family member for a week. Or you may be able to obtain credit through your credit card. Although relying on credit card financing is not recommended, it is substantially less expensive than financing through a payday loan. To illustrate, assume that you could have used a credit card to make your $400 purchase. Also assume that the rate on your credit card is 18% annually, or 1.5% over one month. In this case, your cost of financing would be

.
 This financing cost for one month is much lower than the cost of financing when using a payday loan. You might also be able to pay off your credit card balance in time to avoid any interest.
How Personal Loans Fit within Your Financial Plan
The following are the key personal loan decisions that should be included in your financial plan:

How much money can you afford to borrow on a personal loan?

If you obtain a personal loan, should you pay it off early?

By making informed decisions, you can avoid accumulating an excessive amount of debt. Exhibit 9.7 provides an example of how personal loan decisions apply to Stephanie Spratt’s financial plan. The exhibit shows how Stephanie reviews her typical monthly cash flows to determine whether she can cover her monthly loan payments.

Summary
PERSONAL LOANS. When applying for a personal loan, you need to disclose your personal balance sheet and cash flow statement so that the lender can evaluate your ability to repay a loan. A loan contract specifies the amount of the loan, interest rate, repayment schedule, maturity, and collateral.

INTEREST RATES ON PERSONAL LOANS. The common types of interest rates charged on personal loans are the annual percentage rate (APR), simple interest, and add-on interest. The APR measures the interest and other expenses as a percentage of the loan amount on an annualized basis. Simple interest measures the interest as a percentage of the existing loan amount. Add-on interest calculates interest on the loan amount, adds the interest and principal, and divides the resulting amount by the number of payments.

FINANCING A CAR. Your purchase of a car may require financing. You can reduce your monthly payments on the car loan if you make a higher down payment, but this may reduce your liquidity. Alternatively, you can reduce your monthly payments by extending the loan period.

CAR LOAN VERSUS LEASE. The decision of whether to purchase a car with a car loan or lease a car requires an estimation of the total cost of each alternative. The total cost of purchasing a car consists of the down payment, the forgone interest income from the down payment, and the total monthly loan payments. The total cost of leasing consists of the forgone interest income from the security deposit and the total monthly lease payments.

STUDENT LOANS. Student loans are provided by the federal government and by financial institutions that participate in student loan programs.

HOME EQUITY LOANS. A home equity loan or home equity line of credit commonly has more favorable terms than other personal loans. It has a relatively low interest rate because of the collateral (the home) that backs the loan.

PAYDAY LOANS. A payday loan is a short-term loan that provides funds in advance of receiving a paycheck. Payday loans typically have a very high interest rate. Therefore, consider various alternative ways of borrowing money before obtaining a payday loan.

HOW PERSONAL LOANS FIT WITHIN YOUR FINANCIAL PLAN. Personal loans allow you to obtain assets that you could not obtain if you did not have access to funding. They can enable you to achieve your financial goals, such as buying a car or a home.
