There is an old saying that is good advice for investors: “Do not put all of your eggs in one basket.” If you drop that single basket, all of your eggs might crack. Consider the case of the Saizons, who worked for the same company in the telecommunications field and had seen the tremendous rise in telecom stocks in past years. Hoping that this would be the way to quick wealth, they ignored the advice regarding diversification of an investment portfolio and invested all their savings into a telecommunications mutual fund. The Saizons thought their mutual fund was sufficiently diversified because it contained more than 40 different stocks within the telecommunications sector.

Within two years, their fund was worth half of their original investment. They learned an important lesson about diversification. If the values of all of their investments are driven by the conditions within one sector, then all of their eggs (stocks) are in one basket (sector). If they had diversified their investments across stock mutual funds representing various sectors, they would not have been so exposed to potential weak conditions within a single sector. They could have also invested some money into bond mutual funds representing various types of bonds so that they were not so exposed to general stock market conditions.

Asset allocation is an important strategy for investors. In previous chapters, you learned about building your wealth by investing in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Now that you are familiar with each of these types of investments, you can determine how to distribute your money among the various types of financial assets. The primary goal of asset allocation is reducing your risk while still achieving an acceptable return on your investment.

How Diversification Reduces Risk
If you knew which investment would provide the highest return for a specific investment period, investment decisions would be easy. You would invest all your money in that particular investment. However, investments that could potentially generate high returns are subject to uncertainty.

There is a trade-off between risk and return when investing. Although some investments (such as a U.S. Treasury security or a bank certificate of deposit [CD]) have a known return for a specific investment period, their rate of return is relatively low. Many investments, such as stocks, some types of bonds, and real estate, can potentially generate high rates of return, but their future return is uncertain. They could potentially offer a return of 20% or more this year, but they could also experience a loss of 20% or even worse.

Benefits of Portfolio Diversification
Because the returns from many types of investments are uncertain, it is wise to allocate your money across various types of investments so that you are not completely dependent on any one type. Asset allocation is the process of allocating money across financial assets (such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds). The objective of asset allocation is to achieve your desired return on investments while maintaining your risk at a tolerable level.

Building a Portfolio
You can reduce your risk by investing in a portfolio, which is a set of multiple investments in different assets. For example, your portfolio may consist of various stocks, bonds, and real estate investments. By constructing a portfolio, you diversify across several investments rather than focus on a single investment. Investors who have all their funds invested in a single stock or bond of a firm that goes bankrupt typically lose their entire investment. Given the difficulty in anticipating when a particular investment might experience a major decline in its value, you can at least reduce your exposure to any one stock or bond by spreading your investments across several firms’ stocks and bonds. A portfolio can reduce risk when your investments do not move in perfect tandem. Even if one investment experiences very poor performance, your other investments within the portfolio may perform well and can offset the adverse effects.

Example
You are considering investing in a portfolio consisting of investments A and B. Exhibit 18.1 illustrates the portfolio diversification effect of using these two stocks. The exhibit shows the return per year for investments A and B, as well as for a portfolio with 50% of the investment allocated to A and 50% to B. The portfolio return in each year is simply the average return of A and B. Notice how the portfolio’s range of returns is less than the range of returns of either stock. Also, notice that the portfolio’s returns are less volatile over time than the returns of the individual stocks. Because the portfolio return is an average of A and B, it has a smoother trend than either individual investment. The smoother trend demonstrates that investing in the portfolio is less risky than investing in either individual investment. You can create a diversified portfolio of both investments to reduce your risk.
Exhibit 18.1 Example of Portfolio Diversification Effects

Figure 18.1 Full Alternative Text
Determining Portfolio Benefits
To determine a portfolio’s diversification benefits, you compare the return on its investments to the overall portfolio.

As the previous example illustrates, the main benefit of diversification is that it reduces the exposure of your investments to the adverse effects of any individual investment. In Exhibit 18.1, notice that when investment A experienced a return of 
−
20
%
 in year 2, the portfolio return was 
−
5
%
.
 The adverse effects on the portfolio were limited because investment B’s return was 10% that year. Investment A’s poor performance still affected the portfolio’s performance, but less than if it had been the only investment. When B experienced a weak return (such as 
−
15
%
 in year 5), its poor performance was partially offset because A’s performance was 5% in that year.

Factors That Influence Diversification Benefits
A portfolio’s risk is often measured by its degree of volatility because the more volatile the returns, the more uncertain the future return on the portfolio. Some portfolios are more effective at reducing risk than others. By recognizing the factors that reduce a portfolio’s risk, you can ensure that your portfolio exhibits these characteristics. The volatility of a portfolio’s returns is influenced by the volatility of returns on each investment within the portfolio and by how similar the returns are among investments.

Volatility of Each Individual Investment
As Exhibit 18.2 illustrates, the more volatile the returns of individual investments in a portfolio, the more volatile the portfolio’s returns are over time (holding other factors constant). The left graph shows the returns of investment A (as in Exhibit 18.1), along with investment C and an equal-weighted portfolio of A and C. The right graph shows the individual returns of investments A and D along with the return of an equal-weighted portfolio of A and D. Comparing the returns of investment C on the left with the returns of investment D on the right, it is clear that C is much more volatile. For this reason, the portfolio of A and C (on the left) is more volatile than the portfolio of A and D (on the right).
Exhibit 18.2 Impact of an Investment’s Volatility on Portfolio Diversification Effects

Figure 18.2 Full Alternative Text
Impact of Correlations among Investments
The more similar the returns of individual investments in a portfolio, the more volatile the portfolio’s returns are over time. This point is illustrated in Exhibit 18.3. The left graph shows the returns of investments A and E and an equal-weighted portfolio of the two investments. Notice that investments A and E have very similar return patterns. When investment A performs well, so does E; when A performs poorly, so does E. Consequently, the equal-weighted portfolio of A and E has a return pattern that is almost identical to that of either A or E. Thus, this portfolio exhibits limited diversification benefits.

Exhibit 18.3 Impact of Correlations on Portfolio Diversification Effects

Figure 18.3 Full Alternative Text
The middle graph in Exhibit 18.3 shows the returns of investments A and F and an equal-weighted portfolio of the two investments. Notice that the return patterns of the investments are opposite to one another. When A performs well, F performs relatively poorly. When A performs poorly, F performs well. The returns of A and F are therefore negatively correlated. As a result, the equal-weighted portfolio of A and F has a very stable return pattern because the returns of the stocks moved in opposite directions. Due to the negative correlation of returns, this portfolio offers substantial diversification benefits.

The right graph in Exhibit 18.3 shows the returns of investments A and G and an equal-weighted portfolio of the two investments. Notice that the return patterns of the two stocks are independent of each other. That is, A’s performance is not related to G’s performance. The return pattern of the equal-weighted portfolio of A and G is more volatile than the returns of the portfolio of A and F (middle graph), but less volatile than the returns of the portfolio of A and E (left graph). Thus, the portfolio of investments A and G exhibits more diversification benefits than a portfolio of two investments that are positively related, but less pronounced diversification benefits than a portfolio of negatively correlated investments.

This discussion suggests that when you compile a portfolio to achieve diversification benefits, you should avoid including investments that exhibit a high positive correlation. Although finding investments that are as negatively correlated as A and F may be difficult, you should at least consider investments whose values are not influenced by the same conditions. In reality, many investments are similarly influenced by economic conditions. If economic conditions deteriorate, most investments perform poorly. Nevertheless, some are influenced to a higher degree than others.

Strategies for Diversifying
There are many different strategies for diversifying among investments. Some of the more popular strategies related to stocks are described here.

Diversification of Stocks across Industries
When you diversify your investments among stocks in different industries, you reduce your exposure to one particular industry. For example, you may invest in the stock of a firm in the automobile industry, the stock of a firm in the retail food industry, the stock of a firm in the health care industry, and so on. When economic conditions decline, people may avoid buying new cars, so your automobile stock may perform poorly; however, people still need food and health care, so your food and health care stocks may perform relatively better. Thus, a portfolio of stocks diversified across industries is less risky than a portfolio of stocks that are all based in the same industry.

Limitations of Industry Diversification
Although diversification among stocks in different industries is more effective than diversification within an industry, the portfolio can still be highly susceptible to general economic conditions. Stocks exhibit market risk, or susceptibility to poor performance because of weak stock market conditions. A stock portfolio composed of stocks of U.S. firms based in different industries may perform poorly when economic conditions in the United States are weak. Thus, diversification will not necessarily prevent losses when economic conditions are poor, but it can limit the losses.

Diversification of Stocks across Countries
Because economic conditions (and therefore stock market conditions) vary among countries, you may be more able to reduce your risk by diversifying your stock investments across countries. For example, you may wish to invest in a variety of U.S. stocks across different industries, European stocks, Asian stocks, and Latin American stocks. Many investment advisers recommend that you invest about 80% to 90% of your money in U.S. stocks and allocate 10% to 20% to foreign countries.

ECONOMIC IMPACT

Diversifying among stocks based in some countries outside the United States makes you less vulnerable to conditions in this country. However, economic conditions are some-what integrated across countries. Therefore, international diversification does not completely insulate investors from a weak local economy. When the U.S. economy is very weak and the U.S. stock market performs poorly, non-U.S. stock markets might also perform poorly because the weak conditions in the United States affect conditions in other countries.

Some stocks of non-U.S. firms are typically even more volatile than stocks of U.S. firms, as they are subject to more volatile economic conditions. Therefore, you should diversify among stocks within each foreign country rather than rely on a single stock in any foreign country. Stock markets of small developing countries may be very volatile, so an international portfolio may be less risky if it is focused on developed countries that have well-established stock markets with active trading. International mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be an efficient way to add foreign stocks to your portfolio. Funds are available that focus on a single country, a region, a category such as emerging markets, or the entire world.
Asset Allocation Strategies
When investors make asset allocation decisions, they should not restrict their choices to stocks. All stocks can be affected by general stock market conditions, so diversification benefits are limited. Greater diversification benefits can be achieved by including other financial assets in your investment portfolio, such as bonds, real estate investment trusts, and stock options.

Including Bonds in Your Portfolio
The returns from investing in stocks and from investing in bonds are not highly correlated. Stock prices are influenced by each firm’s expected future performance and general stock market conditions. Bond prices are inversely related to interest rates and are not directly influenced by stock market conditions. Therefore, by including bonds in your investment portfolio, you can reduce your susceptibility to stock market conditions. The expected return on bonds is usually less than the return on stocks, however.

As you allocate more of your investment portfolio to bonds, you reduce your exposure to market risk but increase your exposure to interest rate risk. Your portfolio is more susceptible to a decline in value when interest rates rise because the market values of your bonds will decline. Recall from Chapter 16 that you can limit your exposure to interest rate risk by investing in bonds with relatively short maturities, because the prices of those bonds are less affected by interest rate movements than the prices of long-term bonds.

In general, the larger the proportion of your portfolio that is allocated to bonds, the lower your portfolio’s overall risk (as measured by the volatility of returns). The portfolio’s value will be more stable over time, and it will be less likely to generate a loss in any given period. Investors who are close to retirement commonly allocate much of their portfolio to bonds because they are relying on it to provide them with periodic income. Conversely, investors who are 30 to 50 years old tend to focus their allocation on stocks because they can afford to take risks to strive for a high return on their portfolio.

Including Real Estate Investments in Your Portfolio
Many individuals include real estate investments in their portfolios. One method of investing in real estate is to purchase a home and rent it out. Doing this requires a substantial investment of time and money, however. You must conduct credit checks on prospective renters and maintain the property in good condition. An alternative is to invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs), which pool investments from individuals and use the proceeds to invest in real estate. REITs commonly invest in commercial real estate such as office buildings and shopping centers.

real estate investment trusts (REITs)
Trusts that pool investments from individuals and use the proceeds to invest in real estate.

REITs are similar to closed-end funds in that their shares are traded on stock exchanges; the value of the shares is based on the supply of shares for sale (by investors) and investor demand for the shares. REITs are popular among individual investors because the shares can be purchased with a small amount of money. Another desirable characteristic of REITs is that they are managed by skilled real estate professionals who decide which properties to purchase and manage the maintenance of the properties.

Types of REITs
REITs are classified according to how they invest their money. Equity REITs invest money directly in properties, whereas mortgage REITs invest in mortgage loans that help to finance the development of properties. The performance of an equity REIT is based on changes in the value of its property over time, so returns are influenced by general real estate conditions. The performance of a mortgage REIT is based on the interest payments it receives from the loans it provided.

mortgage REITs

Role of REITs in Asset Allocation
The values of most REITs tend to be highly influenced by real estate conditions. Although this can be favorable in some periods, it exposes investors to high risk because real estate conditions are volatile over time. Therefore, individual investors who invest in REITs may want to further diversify their investment portfolios. A portfolio that contains stocks, bonds, and REITs may be less susceptible to major declines because it is unlikely that all three types of investments will simultaneously perform poorly. For even more diversification when investing in REITs, you might consider a REIT mutual fund or ETF. Most investment companies such as Fidelity and Vanguard offer funds that invest in REITs.

Including Stock Options in Your Portfolio
When making your asset allocation decisions, you may want to consider stock options, which are options to purchase or sell stocks under specified conditions. Like stocks, stock options are traded on exchanges. Some employers include stock options in compensation packages, so you should be aware of them.
stock option
An option to purchase or sell stocks under specified conditions.

Call Options
A call option on a stock provides the right to purchase 100 shares of a specified stock at a specified price (called the exercise price, or strike price) by a specified expiration date. The advantage of a call option is that it locks in the price of the stock and also gives you the flexibility to let the option expire if you wish. The price that you pay when purchasing a call option is referred to as a premium. The premium of a call option is influenced by the number of investors who wish to buy call options on that particular stock. Investors can purchase call options through their brokerage firm, which charges a commission for executing the transaction.

call option
An option that provides the right to purchase 100 shares of a specified stock at a specified price by a specified expiration date.

exercise (strike) price
The price at which a stock option is exercised.

premium
The price that you pay when purchasing a stock option.

Example
On September 10, you pay a premium of $2 per share, or $200, to purchase a call option on Gamma stock. The stock price is currently $28. The call option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of Gamma stock at the exercise price of $30 at any time until the end of November. Thus, no matter how much Gamma’s stock price rises before the end of November, you can still buy the stock at $30 per share.

For every buyer of a call option, there must be a seller who is willing to sell the call option. The seller of a call option is obligated to sell the shares of the specified stock to the buyer for the exercise price if and when the buyer exercises the option.

Example
Joan Montana sold you the call option on Gamma stock. Joan receives the $200 premium that you paid to buy the call option. She is obligated to sell 100 shares of stock to you for $30 per share if and when you exercise the call option.

Your net gain or loss from buying a call option can be determined by considering the amount received when you sell the stock, the amount you paid for the stock when exercising the option, and the amount you paid for the premium.

Example
Recall that you paid a premium of $2 per share, or $200, to purchase the call option on Gamma stock, which gave you the right to purchase Gamma stock for $30 per share by the end of November. Assume that the price of Gamma stock increased from $28 to $35 per share by the end of November. If you exercise the option and then sell the stock in the market at its prevailing price of $35, your gain is as follows:

Net Gain

300
Because you paid $200 for the call option and your net gain was $300, your return can be derived as your net gain divided by the amount of your investment:
Joan does not own shares of Gamma stock, so she has to buy it in the market at $35 per share before selling it to you at $30 per share. Thus, her net gain is as follows:

Amount Received from Selling the Stock 
(

Because her net gain is negative, it reflects a loss. Notice that the dollar amount of your gain is equal to the dollar amount of Joan’s loss.

When investing in a call option on a stock rather than the stock itself, you can magnify your return. The return from investing in the call option (150%) is much higher. However, the risk from investing in the call option is higher than the risk from investing in the stock itself. In the previous example, if Gamma’s stock price had not risen beyond $30, you would have let the call option on Gamma stock expire. Thus, you would have lost 100% of your investment in the call option.

Put Options
A put option on a stock provides the right to sell 100 shares of a specified stock at a specified exercise price by a specified expiration date. You place an order for a put option in the same way that you place an order for a call option. The put option locks in the price at which you can sell the stock and also gives you the flexibility to let the option expire if you wish. You buy a put option when you expect the stock’s price to decline.

put option
An option that provides the right to sell 100 shares of a specified stock at a specified price by a specified expiration date.

Example
On January 18, you pay a $300 premium to purchase a put option on Winger stock, which has an exercise price of $50 and expires at the end of March. The stock price is currently $51 per share. The put option gives you the right to sell 100 shares of Winger stock at the exercise price of $50 at any time up until the end of March. Thus, no matter how much Winger’s stock price decreases before the end of March, you can still sell the stock at $50 per share.

For every buyer of a put option, there must be a seller who is willing to sell the put option. The seller of a put option is obligated to buy the shares of the specified stock from the buyer of the put option for the exercise price if and when the buyer of the put option exercises the option.

The Role of Stock Options in Asset Allocation
Although stock options have become a popular investment for individual investors who want to achieve very high returns, options are still very risky and should therefore play only a minimal role (if any) in asset allocation. Because asset allocation is normally intended to limit exposure to any one type of investment, any allocation to stock options should be made with caution. Many stock options are never exercised, which means that the investment generates a return of 
−
100
%
.

Nevertheless, there are some ways of using stock options to reduce the risk of your portfolio. Two of the more common methods are discussed next.

First, you can limit the risk of stocks you hold by purchasing put options on them.

Example
You invested in 100 shares of Dragon stock a year ago. Assume that you think it will perform well over the long term but are worried that it may perform poorly in the near future. The present price of the stock is $40 per share. You decide to pay a premium of $3 per share, or $300, for a put option on Dragon stock with an exercise price of $38. If the stock price stays above $38 per share, you will not exercise the put option. Conversely, if the stock price falls below $38 per share, you can exercise the put option by selling the shares you are holding for $38 per share.

In this example, your purchase of a put option locked in a minimum price at which you could sell a stock you were holding, no matter how much that stock’s price declines. Thus, you were able to reduce your portfolio’s risk by limiting your potential loss on this stock.

Second, you can also reduce your risk by selling call options on stocks you hold. Doing so is referred to as a covered call strategy because the call option you sell is covered by stock that you already own.
covered call strategy
A strategy that consists of selling call options on stock that you own.

Example
Assume once again that you are concerned that the price of Dragon stock may decline soon. There is a call option available with an exercise price of $42 and a premium of $2. You decide to sell a call option on Dragon stock and receive a premium of 
$
200
 
(
$
2
×
100
 shares
)
.
 If the price of Dragon stock rises above $42 per share, the call option will be exercised, and you will have to sell the stock to fulfill your obligation. However, you will at least sell the stock for a gain. Conversely, if the stock price remains below $42, the call option will not be exercised. In this case, the $200 that you earned from selling the call option can help offset the stock’s poor performance, thereby reducing your potential losses from holding it.

How Asset Allocation Affects Risk
Some asset allocation strategies reduce risk to a greater degree than others. To maintain a very low level of risk, an asset allocation may emphasize money market funds, U.S. government bonds, and the stocks of large established U.S. firms. These types of investments tend to have low risk but also offer a relatively low rate of return. To strive for a higher return, the asset allocation could include more real estate and stocks from developing countries. Exhibit 18.4 compares different asset allocation strategies in terms of risk and potential return.

Exhibit 18.4 Comparison of Asset Allocation Strategies by Risk

Figure 18.4 Full Alternative Text
Be aware, however, that even the most conservative asset allocation strategy can result in a loss over a given period. In some periods, stocks, real estate, and low-rated corporate bonds have all experienced losses simultaneously. Therefore, an asset allocation strategy that diversified among these types of assets would have resulted in a large loss.

An Affordable Way to Conduct Asset Allocation
When allocating money across a set of financial assets, you are subject to transaction fees on each investment that you make. Thus, it can be costly to invest in a wide variety of investments. You can reduce your diversification costs by investing in mutual funds and ETFs. Because a typical stock fund contains more than 50 stocks, you can broadly diversify by investing in just a few funds.

For example, you could invest in a stock fund focusing on stocks of large U.S. firms, another stock fund that focuses on stocks of small U.S. firms, and a third stock fund that focuses on a foreign country. You could also invest in a bond mutual fund or ETF that contains the types of bonds and maturities that you desire. You may also consider investing in a REIT to diversify your portfolio even further. With this type of portfolio, you can limit your exposure to adverse conditions such as a weak performance by a single firm, a single industry, or a single country, or events such as an increase in interest rates.

Your Asset Allocation Decision
Your ideal asset allocation will likely not be appropriate for someone else because of differences in your personal characteristics and investment goals. The asset allocation decision hinges on several factors, including your stage in life and your risk tolerance.

Your Stage in Life
Investors early in their career paths need easy access to funds, so they should invest in relatively safe and liquid securities, such as money market investments. If you do not expect to need the invested funds soon, you may want to consider investing in a diversified portfolio of individual stocks, individual bonds, stock mutual funds or ETFs, and bond funds. Investors who expect to be working for many more years may invest in stocks of smaller firms and growth stock funds, which have high growth potential. Conversely, investors nearing retirement age may allocate a larger proportion of money to investments that will generate a fixed income, such as individual bonds, stock funds containing high-dividend stocks, bond funds, and some types of REITs.

Although no single asset allocation formula is suitable for everyone, the common trends in asset allocation over a lifetime are shown in Exhibit 18.5. Notice the heavy emphasis on stocks at an early stage of life, as individuals take some risks in the hope that they can increase their wealth. Over time, they gradually shift toward bonds or stocks of stable firms that pay high dividends. The portfolio becomes less risky as it shifts to a higher proportion of bonds and stocks of stable firms. This portfolio is less likely to generate large returns, but it will provide periodic income on retirement. In fact, your portfolio will likely be your main source of income after you retire. Chapter 19 discusses the role of savings in retirement planning in detail.

Exhibit 18.5 Asset Allocation over Time

Figure 18.5 Full Alternative Text
Exhibit 18.6 provides a more detailed example of how your asset allocation might change over time. In the early career stage, your allocation may be focused on stocks with much potential for growth and a relatively high level of risk. Although stocks can lose value, they typically perform well over the long term. You may be more willing to accept risk at an early stage in your career because even if stocks perform poorly over a short period of time, there is time for them to improve before you may want to sell the assets to use the cash. However, even at an early stage, you should maintain some liquid assets (such as money market securities) that can be sold if you need cash to pay bills, make a down payment on a home, or for other reasons.
Exhibit 18.6 How Asset Allocation Varies with Your Stage in Life

Figure 18.6 Full Alternative Text
In the middle stage of your career, you may reduce your more risky assets and hold a higher proportion of safer assets such as Treasury bonds. By the time you retire, you may want to reduce your proportion of stocks even further and allocate more funds to Treasury bonds. Ideally, the securities that you hold by the time you retire can generate sufficient income to support you for the rest of your life. If you have a large number of stocks at that time, there is a risk that your stocks could lose much of their value, and your assets may no longer be able to provide adequate financial support.

Your Degree of Risk Tolerance
Investors also vary in their degree of risk tolerance. If you are unwilling to take much risk, you should focus on safe investments. For example, you might invest in Treasury bonds with relatively short maturities. If you are willing to accept a moderate level of risk, you may consider a stock mutual fund or ETF that represents the S&P 500 stock index and large-cap stock funds that invest in stocks of very large and stable firms. These investments offer more potential return than an investment in Treasury bonds, but they may also result in losses in some periods.

If you are willing to tolerate a higher degree of risk to strive for higher returns, you may consider individual stocks. Smaller stocks that are focused on technology tend to have the potential for high returns, but they are also very risky. Even if you can tolerate a high level of risk, you should still diversify your investments. You might consider various funds that have the potential to achieve a high return but contain a diversified set of stocks, so you are not overly exposed to a single stock. Recall from Chapter 17 that you can choose among various growth funds, capital appreciation funds, and even funds focused on various sectors such as health care or financial firms. You may also consider bond funds that invest in corporate bonds. You can increase your potential return (and therefore your risk) by focusing on high-yield (junk) bond funds with long terms to maturity.

PSYCHOLOGY of Personal Finance

Some investors use an unrealistic perception of the investment environment to justify their investment behavior. They are unwilling to recognize how much risk they are taking. They make investments that tend to generate a very strong return when economic conditions are favorable but losses when economic conditions are unfavorable. When economic conditions are favorable, these investors are very pleased and believe that they have very good investment skills. However, when economic conditions are unfavorable, these types of investments perform poorly.

Some investors simply are unwilling to accept that unfavorable economic conditions might occur. They always have an optimistic outlook on the economy, but they should be realistic rather than overly optimistic. That is, as they make risky investments, they should recognize that they could easily incur large losses if the economy weakens. If they are not in a position in which they can afford to incur large losses, they should seriously consider safer types of investments. Safer investments, however, are not as exciting because they do not offer the potential for high returns. Thus, some investors end up gambling their money in risky investments and therefore possibly risk major losses that they cannot afford.

Your Expectations About Economic Conditions
ECONOMIC IMPACT

Your expectations about economic conditions also influence your asset allocation. If you expect strong stock market conditions, you may shift a larger proportion of your money into your stock mutual funds or ETFs. Conversely, if you expect a temporary weakness in the stock market, you may shift a larger proportion of your money to your bond funds. If you expect interest rates to decrease, you may consider shifting money from a bond fund containing bonds with short maturities to one containing bonds with longer maturities. You can easily shift money among mutual funds and ETFs if the funds are managed by the same investment company (part of the same family).

If you anticipate favorable real estate conditions, you may allocate some of your money to REITs. As time passes, your expectations may change, causing some types of financial assets to become more desirable than others. Over time, you should change the composition of your investment portfolio in response to changes in your market expectations, investment goals, and life circumstances.

Because predicting economic conditions is nearly impossible, it is difficult to determine which types of investments will perform best in a given period. Consequently, you may be better off basing your asset allocation decisions completely on your stage in life and degree of risk tolerance. Once you establish a diversified portfolio of investments, you will need to revise the portfolio only when you enter a different stage in life or change your degree of risk tolerance.

Stephanie Spratt wants to develop a long-term financial plan for allocating money to various financial assets. Specifically, she wants to set rough goals for the proportion of money that she will invest in stocks, bonds, and REITs over the next 10 years. Because she may be working for another 30 years, she does not feel it is necessary to allocate a large proportion of her money to bonds at this time. She recognizes that bonds are typically safer than stocks, but plans to consider bond and stock mutual funds and ETFs in the future. She recognizes that stocks are risky, but is comfortable taking some risk at this stage in her life. She plans to consider some equity income funds, growth stock funds (such as technology funds), and international funds. However, she will try to reduce her exposure to stock market conditions by investing in some alternative types of investments as well, such as bonds and REITs.

When she is close to retirement, she will take a more conservative investment approach that reduces risk (and offers a lower potential return).

How Asset Allocation Fits into Your Financial Plan
The following are the key asset allocation decisions that should be included in your financial plan:

Is your present asset allocation of investments appropriate?

How will you apply asset allocation in the future?

Exhibit 18.7 provides an example of how asset allocation decisions apply to Stephanie Spratt’s financial plan. Stephanie’s first concern is maintaining adequate liquidity and being able to make her existing loan payments. As she accumulates more money beyond what she needs for these purposes, she will allocate money to various investments.

Summary
DIVERSIFICATION EFFECT ON RISK. Asset allocation uses diversification to reduce your risk from investing. In general, an investment portfolio is subject to less risk when it is diversified among assets whose returns are less volatile and are not highly correlated with each other over time.

STOCK DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES. Common stock diversification strategies include diversifying among stocks across industries and countries. Consider using these two types of diversification so that you limit the exposure of your stock investments to any external forces that could affect their value.

ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGIES. Your asset allocation decision should not be restricted to stocks. Because bond returns are primarily influenced by interest rate movements rather than stock market conditions, they are not highly positively correlated with stock returns over time. Therefore, bonds can reduce the risk in an investment portfolio. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are primarily influenced by real estate conditions and can also be useful for diversifying an investment portfolio. Stock options can also reduce the risk of your portfolio if used properly.

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ASSET ALLOCATION. Your asset allocation decision should reflect your stage in life, your degree of risk tolerance, and your expectations of economic conditions. If you are young, you may be more willing to invest in riskier securities to build wealth. If you are near retirement, you should consider investing more of your money in investments that can provide you with a stable income (dividends and interest payments) over time. If you are more willing to tolerate risk, you may invest in riskier stocks and bonds. Your asset allocation is also influenced by your expectations about future economic conditions. These conditions will affect the expected performance of stocks, bonds, and REITs and therefore should shape your decision of how to allocate your money across these financial assets.

HOW ASSET ALLOCATION FITS INTO YOUR FINANCIAL PLAN. Asset allocation determines how to diversify your investments. You may rely on your investments to build your wealth over time, and you may ultimately rely on that wealth to cover your future spending behavior. Therefore, your asset allocation decisions can help you achieve your financial plan.
