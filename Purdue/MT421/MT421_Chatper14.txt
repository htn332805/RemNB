Five years ago, Ryan invested $5,000 in stocks of well-known companies. His original investment is now worth $8,000.

Meanwhile, five years ago Brad invested $5,000 in stock of Zyko Company, because Zyko claimed that its new technology would change the world, and Brad wanted to earn higher returns on his investment than he might earn on the stock of well-established firms. Zyko’s technology failed, however, and the company went bankrupt. Consequently, Brad’s stock was worthless. Furthermore, Brad had borrowed $2,000 of the money that he invested and had to sell his car to obtain enough funds to repay the loan. He was not in a suitable financial position to be taking so much risk with his investment strategy.

These examples demonstrate that the same type of investment can have entirely different outcomes. As you will learn in this chapter, there are a variety of types of investments, and the risk and return of these different investments vary widely. Your ability to analyze investments can enhance your investment income and increase your net worth.

The objectives of this chapter are to
Explain why paying off some debt should be prioritized before investing.

Describe the common types of investments available to investors.

Explain how to measure the return on investments.

Identify the risks of investments.

Explain the trade-off between the return and risk of investments.

Describe common investment mistakes that should be avoided.

Explain how personal investing fits within your financial plan.

Pay Off Debt Before Investing
Before considering how to invest money, review your personal balance sheet. If you have any existing loans, you should consider paying off those loans before investing any money. Some individuals receive a much larger psychological boost from using money to make investments than from paying off existing loans, because they might think they will quickly double their money. However, such a strategy can backfire if the investments perform poorly.

PSYCHOLOGY of Personal Finance

Paying off debt may seem insignificant, because you might feel like you are not spending the money on anything that is immediately pleasing to you. However, you should feel less stress each month when you no longer have to make a payment on the loan that you paid off. In fact, you might feel like you have received extra income every month as a result, because you now can use the portion of your income that you used to pay down your loan in a manner that you enjoy. By paying off debt, you did not increase your assets, but you did reduce your liabilities, and that boosts your net worth just as much as if you increased your assets. Furthermore, it is a safer strategy.

Example

It has now been about three years since Stephanie Spratt began her full-time job, and she was recently rewarded for her performance. She just received a bonus of $21,000 (after taxes) from her employer. Stephanie wants to consider investments that would generate enough income each month to cover her car loan and student loan payments, because she feels anxious every month about making her loan payments.

Once Stephanie graduated from college and started her full-time job, she needed to start repaying her $10,000 student loan (as described in Chapter 2). About one year later, she obtained a car loan to purchase a new car (as described in Chapter 9). Then, another year later, she obtained a mortgage loan to purchase a home (as described in Chapter 10). Her income has been steadily increasing since she began her job, and she has been able to make her payments on all three loans every month, while also maintaining sufficient liquidity. But her monthly payments on all three loans leave her with little money left over after covering her other bills.

Stephanie makes combined monthly payments of $500 on her car and student loans, so she wanted to select investments that would provide income of at least $500 each month to cover those debt payments. She considered some relatively stable stocks and stock mutual funds that provide dividends but was concerned that even those investments could lose value over time.

Then she realized that there is an easier way to achieve her goal. She still owes about $9,000 on her car loan and $8,000 on her student loan. Both loans have a rate of about 6%. Rather than make investments that would generate enough income to cover the monthly debt payments (but would possibly lose value over time), she decided to pay off the car loan and student loan debt. She used $9,000 of her bonus money to pay off her car loan, and $8,000 of her bonus money to pay off her student loan.

Since Stephanie’s monthly payments were $400 for the car loan and $100 for the student loan, her monthly cash outflows to make loan payments will be reduced by $500. This means that her monthly net cash flow will increase by $500. This substantial improvement in her monthly budget will reduce her anxiety, and she will be satisfied each month when she can spend or invest that $500 that she had previously used to pay down the loans. Her only remaining loan is her mortgage loan, which has a relatively low interest rate of 5%. After paying off her car and student loans, Stephanie will have $4,000 of bonus money remaining, which she will use to make investments.
Types of Investments
If you do not have existing liabilities that should be paid off, review the possible ways to invest any money that you have. Your first priority should be to ensure adequate liquidity. You can satisfy your liquidity needs by depositing funds in financial institutions or by investing in money market securities such as certificates of deposit (CDs). Because these types of investments are primarily focused on providing liquidity, they offer a relatively low return. If you have additional funds beyond your liquidity needs, you have a wide variety of investments to consider.

Money Market Securities
Recall from Chapter 6 that there are several different money market securities available, including CDs, money market deposit accounts, and money market funds. Most money market securities provide interest income. Even if your liquidity needs are covered, you may invest in these securities to avoid risk. For example, if you have funds that you will need in one year for a down payment on a home, you can invest in a one-year CD at a financial institution. By investing in the CD, you will receive a guaranteed return (although the return will be lower than the potential return of many more-risky investments). However, you might also consider some alternative securities that typically provide a higher rate of return than CDs but are somewhat more risky.

Stocks
As mentioned in Chapter 2, stocks are financial instruments representing partial ownership of a firm. Investors in stock become shareholders of the firm. Firms issue stocks to obtain funds to expand their business operations. Investors invest in stock when they believe that they may earn a higher return than alternative investments offer. Because stocks are a popular type of investment for individuals, they are the focus of Chapter 15.

Common versus Preferred Stock
Stock can be classified as common stock or preferred stock. Common stock is a financial instrument issued by a firm to raise funds that represents partial ownership in the firm. Investors who hold common stock normally have the right to vote on key issues such as the sale of the company. They elect the board of directors, which is responsible for ensuring that the firm’s managers serve the interests of its shareholders. Preferred stock is a financial instrument issued by a firm to raise funds that entitles shareholders to first priority (ahead of common stockholders) in receiving dividends. Corporations issue common stock more frequently than preferred stock. The price of preferred stock is not as volatile as the price of common stock and does not have as much potential to increase substantially. For this reason, investors who strive for high returns typically invest in common stock.

preferred stock

Primary and Secondary Stock Markets
Stocks can be traded in a primary or a secondary market. The primary market is a market in which newly issued securities are traded. Firms can raise funds by issuing new stock in the primary market. The first offering of a firm’s stock to the public is referred to as an initial public offering (IPO). A secondary market facilitates the trading of existing securities by enabling investors to sell their shares at any time. These shares are purchased by other investors who wish to invest in that stock. Thus, even if a firm is not issuing new shares of stock, investors can easily obtain shares of that firm’s stock by purchasing them in the secondary market. On a typical day, millions of shares of any large firm’s stock are traded in the secondary market. The price of the stock changes each day in response to changes in supply and demand.

Types of Investors Who Purchase Stocks
Investors in stock can be classified as institutional investors or individual investors. Institutional investors are professionals employed by a financial institution who are responsible for managing money on behalf of the clients they serve. They attempt to select stocks or other securities that will provide a reasonable return on investment. The employees of financial institutions who make investment decisions are referred to as portfolio managers because they manage a portfolio of securities (including stocks). More than 70% of all trading in financial markets is attributable to institutional investors.

Individual investors commonly invest a portion of the money earned from their jobs. Like institutional investors, they invest in stocks to earn a reasonable return on their investment. In this way, their money can grow by the time they wish to use it to make purchases or to retire. About 61% of individuals in the United States have an investment in stocks. The majority of stock accounts owned by individual investors represent retirement plans.

individual investors
Individuals who invest funds in securities.

Many individual investors hold their stocks for periods beyond one year, but some individual investors called day traders buy stocks and then sell them on the same day. They hope to capitalize on very short-term movements in security prices. In many cases, their investments last for only a few minutes. Some day traders conduct their investing as a career, relying on their returns from investing as their main source of income. In recent years, regulatory changes, such as a rule that you must have at least $25,000 in your account if you make more than four trades in five days, have limited the number of individual investors who engage in day trading. This type of investing is very risky because the stock prices of even the best-managed firms periodically decline. Day trading is not recommended for most investors.

Return on Stocks
Firms can provide a return to their shareholders by paying dividends. That is, they can provide a return to their investors by distributing quarterly income to their shareholders in the form of dividends rather than reinvesting the earnings in the firm’s operations. They tend to keep the dollar amount of the dividends per share fixed from one quarter to the next but may periodically increase the amount. They rarely reduce the dividend amount unless they experience relatively weak performance and cannot afford to make their dividend payment. The amount of dividends paid out per year by firms that pay dividends is usually between 1% and 3% of the stock’s price.

A firm’s decision to distribute earnings as dividends rather than reinvesting all of its earnings to support future growth may depend on the opportunities that are available to the firm. In general, firms that pay high dividends tend to be older, established firms that have less chance for substantial growth. They usually have a somewhat stable stream of quarterly earnings over time. However, when firms pay dividends, they have given up the opportunity to invest that money in new business projects that might have led to higher earnings. Yet, by giving a portion of their earnings to shareholders instead of investing that money, firms have avoided the potential of investing that money in business projects that could have failed.

Stocks that provide investors with periodic income in the form of large dividends are referred to as income stocks. They are normally perceived to have less risk than other types of stocks.

Firms can also provide a return to their investors through share price appreciation, which is the percentage increase in the stock over the investment period. The stocks of relatively young firms with substantial growth opportunities are often referred to as growth stocks. These stocks normally do not pay any dividends to investors because the firms want to use all funds available to pursue various business projects. Some investors are attracted to these younger firms because they might generate very large returns once they have reached their full potential. However, an investment in these firms is exposed to much higher uncertainty because young firms are more likely to fail or experience very weak performance than mature firms.

Prices of stocks of even well-respected firms decline in some periods and can result in losses to investors. Consequently, investors must be willing to accept the possibility of losses if they invest in stocks.

Return on Bonds
Bonds offer a return to investors by paying periodic interest (coupon) payments, usually every six months, although some coupons are paid quarterly or annually. Because bonds can provide a fixed amount of interest income periodically, they are desirable for investors who want their investments to generate a predictable amount of income each year.

A bond’s price can increase over time and therefore may provide investors with a capital gain, representing the difference between the price at which it was sold by an investor versus the price at which it was purchased. However, a bond’s price may decline, which could cause investors to experience a capital loss. Even the prices of U.S. Treasury bonds decline in some periods. More details about bonds are provided in Chapter 16.

Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds
Mutual funds sell shares to individuals and invest the proceeds in a portfolio of investments such as bonds or stocks. A typical mutual fund may have sold shares to hundreds of thousands of small investors, and it pools the money so that its portfolio managers can decide how to invest in a very large portfolio of securities that might be valued at more than $1 billion. Each individual investor in the mutual fund has a tiny ownership of that large portfolio. Because a mutual fund typically invests in numerous securities, it enables each investor to achieve broad diversification with a very small investment.

As time passes, more money flows from new investors into a mutual fund, while some money is withdrawn from the mutual fund by previous investors. The portfolio managers of a mutual fund may frequently revise the fund’s portfolio of securities in response to changes in the total amount of money invested by investors. Investors who invest in a mutual fund can normally withdraw their funds whenever they desire.

There are thousands of mutual funds from which to choose. Some stock mutual funds invest in a broad portfolio of stocks, while others invest in stocks within a particular business sector. Some bond mutual funds invest in a wide variety of corporate or Treasury bonds. Other so-called hybrid mutual funds invest in a combination of stocks and bonds.

Because mutual funds are managed, a management fee is charged to investors in a mutual fund. For some mutual funds, the management fee (called an expense ratio) may represent 1% or more of each investor’s investment in the fund per year. For other mutual funds, the fee is much smaller.

Another option for individual investors who want a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds is to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are securities whose values move in tandem with a particular index representing a set of investments. They can be traded on the stock exchanges like individual stocks, unlike mutual funds. One popular type of ETF is a publicly traded stock index, whose value moves in tandem with the value of a particular stock index.

publicly traded stock indexes

Much research has shown that sophisticated investors (such as well-paid portfolio managers of financial institutions) are unable to outperform various stock indexes on average. By investing in an index, individual investors can ensure that their performance will match that index without having to pay the high management fees that some mutual funds charge.

One of the most popular ETFs is the Standard & Poor’s Depository Receipt (SPDR, called “Spider”), for the S&P 500 index (which represents 500 very large publicly traded companies). The S&P 500 Spider is a basket of stocks that matches the S&P 500 index and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It is one of the most heavily traded instruments on the exchange with 75 million shares being traded each day on average. You can buy Spiders through a broker, just like stocks.

When investors expect that the large U.S. stocks represented by the S&P 500 will experience strong performance, they can capitalize on their expectations by purchasing shares of the S&P 500 Spider. Spiders provide investors with a return in the form of not only potential share price appreciation but also dividends in the form of additional shares to the investors. Any expenses incurred by the Spiders from creating the index are deducted from the dividends. However, the fees charged are typically very low, as it is less expensive for an ETF to build a portfolio of securities that matches a particular stock index than it is for a mutual fund to actively manage a portfolio of securities.

Some ETFs represent specific sector indexes, including the energy, technology, and financial sectors. Because each index represents several stocks, you can achieve some degree of diversification by investing in an index. There are also ETFs that represent specific bond indexes.

Return on Mutual Funds and ETFs
A mutual fund or ETF can generate a return for its investors by distributing dividends or coupon payments to its investors. The dividend or coupon payment generated by the fund’s portfolio of securities is passed on to the individual investor.

A mutual fund or ETF can also generate a return for its investors through share price appreciation. Because these funds represent a portfolio of securities, their values change over time in response to changes in the values of their underlying portfolio (or index) of securities. A mutual fund or ETF can generate a capital gain for individual investors because the price at which investors sell their shares of the fund may be higher than the price at which they purchased the shares. However, the price of the fund’s shares may also decline over time (if the values of the securities it holds decline over time), which would result in a capital loss. Mutual funds and ETFs are discussed in more detail in Chapter 17.

Real Estate
One way of investing in real estate is to buy a home. The value of a home changes over time in response to supply and demand. When the demand for homes in your area increases, home values tend to rise. The return that you earn on your home is difficult to measure because you must take into account the financing, real estate agent commissions, and tax effects. However, a few generalizations are worth mentioning. For a given amount invested in the home, your return depends on how the value of your home changes over the time that you own it. Your return also depends on your original down payment on the home. The return will be higher if you make a smaller down payment when purchasing the home. Because the value of a home can decline over time, there is the risk of a loss (a negative return) on your investment. If you are in a hurry to sell your home, you may have to lower your selling price to attract potential buyers, which will result in a lower return on your investment.
You can also invest in real estate by purchasing rental property or land. The price of land is based on supply and demand. There is little open land, and due to dense populations along the coasts of the United States, open land along the coasts typically has a high price.

An alternative to investing in actual real estate is to invest in a real estate investment trust (REIT), which is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-producing real estate such as office buildings, shopping malls, or apartment buildings. A REIT obtains the money to invest in real estate by pooling investments from investors. Some REITs are listed on the stock exchange, and their shares can be purchased through a broker in the same way as stocks of corporations.

Return from Investing in Real Estate
Real estate that can be rented (such as office buildings and apartments) generates income in the form of rent payments. In addition, investors may earn a capital gain if they sell the property for a higher price than they paid for it. Alternatively, they may sustain a capital loss if they sell the property for a lower price than they paid for it. The price of land changes over time in response to real estate development. Many individuals may purchase land as an investment, hoping that they will be able to sell it in the future for a higher price than they paid for it.

Precious Metals
Precious metals can also be considered for potential investments. Gold is the metal most commonly purchased for investment purposes, but silver, platinum, and palladium may also be used as investments. Silver, platinum, and palladium have industrial uses in goods such as electronics and catalytic converters for cars, so their prices are affected by the demand for these products. Gold, however, has few uses except for jewelry. Instead, gold is primarily considered a store of value, especially during periods of political or financial crisis when the prices of other assets generally decline. Thus, the price of gold tends to rise during wars or other crises and during periods of high inflation.

Because gold tends to retain its value during periods of crisis, some investors like to keep at least a small percentage of their investment portfolio in gold. During periods when economic conditions are strong, however, gold generally does not perform as well as other financial assets.

If you wish to invest in gold or other precious metals, you can do so in several ways. One way is to purchase actual gold bullion in the form of gold bars or coins. However, you have to store it in a safe place such as a safe deposit box. Alternatively, you can pay a fee to leave the gold stored at the company from which you purchased it. If you choose this alternative, be sure to check the reputation of the company very carefully because if it goes bankrupt, you are unlikely to recover your gold.

Another way to invest in precious metals is to purchase mining stocks. Several gold mining stocks trade on the stock exchange, and some of them pay dividends. Although the values of mining stocks are affected by the price of the precious metal, they also are affected by the quality of the company’s management. Consequently, the values of the stocks tend to be more volatile than the price of the metal that the companies mine. When investing in a mining stock, examine the company and its management in the same way that you would evaluate any other corporate stock.

A third way to invest in precious metals is to buy exchange-traded funds. Several exchange-traded funds backed by precious metals are available. Some of them focus on only gold or another precious metal; others represent several precious metals, so they provide a way to diversify your investments among the metals.

The gain from investing in bullion or exchange-traded funds that are backed by precious metals is subject to a relatively high tax. The Internal Revenue Service has classified precious metals as “collectibles,” and the long-term capital gain on collectibles is subject to a much higher tax rate than long-term gains earned from investing in financial assets. However, gains from mining stocks are taxed at a similar rate as financial assets.

Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrency is a digital encrypted medium of exchange that is not managed by a central authority. It is sometimes accepted as a medium of exchange for particular types of transactions. Various types of cryptocurrency can be obtained, and some types are more commonly accepted as a medium of exchange than others. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency. Any type of cryptocurrency can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges.

Each cryptocurrency has a value that changes over time in response to the demand for it versus the supply of it for sale. Some investors purchase cryptocurrency as an investment, hoping to buy it at a relatively low price and sell it later for a much higher price. Because many cryptocurrencies experience very large price swings in short periods of time, investors can earn very high returns from investing in cryptocurrency. But for the same reason, some investors have lost their investment in a short period of time. For this reason, investors should not consider investing in cryptocurrency unless they fully understand the risks.

Because of the lack of regulation, cryptocurrency is ripe for scams. Common cryptocurrency scams include pretending to sell cryptocurrency to individuals, setting up fake accounts to steal personal financial information, and stealing the cryptocurrency from accounts. The easiest way to avoid such scams is to avoid any participation in cryptocurrency.

Return on Your Investment
When an investment provides income to you, any portion of that income that you save will increase the value of your assets. For example, if you receive a coupon payment of $100 this month as a result of holding a bond and deposit the check in your savings account, your assets will increase by $100. If the value of your investments increases and your liabilities do not increase, your wealth increases.

Monitoring Your Investments
After making investments, you should periodically monitor price movements of your investments so that you are positioned to possibly sell any investments whose prices might be near their peak. There are very useful apps for this purpose, including the Yahoo Finance app. You can establish a list of stocks that you own and as well as a list of stocks that you might consider purchasing someday. The app will provide you with a real-time update of the market price for every stock that is on your list. You can monitor how the stock price has moved up to the present moment for the day or can review the price movements for the last week, month, or year. This information would allow you to determine the return on your stock if you decide to sell it at this moment.

You can also review the range of the stock’s price for the day or for the last year, which indicates its risk. Many of the apps also provide links to news stories about the stocks on your list and additional statistics about the stock. This information can be quickly reviewed on your mobile phone at your convenience. You can even set up price alerts to notify you if a particular stock on your list experiences a specific percentage change from this moment, such as a 10% decrease or a 10% increase. Overall, this type of app is very useful for monitoring the performance of your existing stocks or stocks that you might wish to purchase in the future.

Predicting How Your Investments Will Grow
The degree to which you can accumulate wealth partially depends on your investment decisions. You can estimate the amount by which your wealth will increase from an investment based on an assumed rate of return.

Now that Stephanie Spratt has paid off her car and student loans, she expects to have money that she can invest in stocks each year. She wants to estimate the future value of her investments if she invests $4,000 in stocks at the end of each year for the next 10 years. As her investment strategy represents an annuity, she can use the process of determining the future value of an annuity described in Chapter 3.

If she expects a rate of return on her investment of 10% annually, she can use the future value interest factor of an annuity at 10% over 10 years, which is 15.937 (see Table C.3 in Appendix C). Based on her annual investment (denoted as

Your calculator should display the computed future value of $63,750, consistent with the previous answer derived from using the future value of the annuity table (the answer differs slightly from the previous problem due to rounding in the previous problem).

Because Stephanie recognizes that her estimate of the rate of return on this investment may be wrong, she also wants to determine the future value of her investment strategy if the rate of return is only 5% annually instead of 10%. In this case, the

 is 12.578, and the value of her annual investments in 10 years will be:

Notice how the increase in Stephanie’s wealth is sensitive to the rate of return earned on her annual investment. An annual rate of return of 10% would allow her to accumulate $13,438 more than if the annual rate of return is only 5%.
Risk from Investing
The risk of an investment comes from the uncertainty surrounding its return. The return that you will earn on a specific stock is uncertain because its future dividend payments (if any) are not guaranteed, and its future price (when you sell the stock) is uncertain. The return that you will earn on a bond is uncertain because its coupon payments are not guaranteed, and its future price (when you sell the bond) is uncertain. The return that you will earn from investing in a mutual fund or ETF is uncertain too, because its dividend (or coupon) payments are uncertain and the future values of the stocks (or bonds) contained within the fund when you sell the fund shares are uncertain. The return that you will earn from investing in real estate is also uncertain because its value when you sell it is uncertain. Chapters 15, 16, and 17 discuss specific risks associated with investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs.

Illustration of Risk
If investors gamble at a casino, they recognize that they may lose money because of the uncertainty surrounding whatever they bet on. They can place bets that are long shots, meaning that these bets are unlikely to be correct. If they are correct, they will win a large amount of money. But if they are wrong, they will lose money. They may feel a special satisfaction from winning a large amount of money, even though the odds of winning are very low.

PSYCHOLOGY of Personal Finance

Some types of investments are similar to gambling in that they will generate a large gain under perfect conditions, but they will perform poorly under unfavorable conditions. As with gambling, these types of investments attract investors because the potential for a large gain is appealing. However, many investors are in denial about the risk that is involved when pursuing investments that have the potential for very large returns.

Risk Due to Uncertainty Surrounding Economic Conditions
A key reason for uncertainty surrounding the return on an investment is the uncertainty surrounding the economic conditions that influence the performance of an investment. The future values of investments depend on the demand by investors. When economic conditions are favorable, the income levels of investors are high, the earnings levels of firms are high, and there is a strong demand for most types of investments. When economic conditions are weak, the income levels of investors are low, the earnings levels of firms are low, and there is a weak demand for most types of investments. However, future economic conditions are uncertain, so it is difficult to predict the level of demand for various investments and therefore the future values of these investments.

Example
You have $5,000 to invest and plan to invest this money for one year. You consider an investment in a business that produces smartphones. You expect to generate a return on your investment of 30% over one year under the following ideal conditions:

The president of the company remains healthy.

The key employees in the company continue to work there.

The business creates a new type of smartphone that becomes popular with consumers during the next year.

These three ideal conditions are subject to uncertainty, as there is no guarantee that the ideal conditions will occur. If the president of the company becomes ill, there may be a lack of leadership, and the business may not perform well. If key employees in the company decide to leave to work for another firm, the business may not perform well. If the smartphone created by the business does not appeal to customers, the firm’s sales will be low and business performance may be weak.

Overall, if any one of the ideal conditions does not occur, the performance of the business may be much weaker than what you expected, and the return on your investment will be less than what you expected. Thus, the uncertainty surrounding these conditions causes uncertainty surrounding the return that you will earn on your investment. In fact, conditions could be bad enough to cause the business to perform very poorly. In this case, the return on your investment may be negative, so that you end up with less money in one year than you initially invested, or you might even lose your entire investment. The greater the uncertainty surrounding the conditions that affect the return on your investment, the greater the risk that the return on your investment will be worse than what you expected. Although it is impossible to anticipate changes in all conditions, you can at least recognize how various types of unfavorable conditions could occur that might cause losses in some investments.

Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic
When the COVID-19 pandemic reached the United States in early 2020, many businesses shut down temporarily. There were many layoffs, and the U.S. economy weakened substantially. Stock prices of many firms declined by more than 50% in the first few months of 2020, and some firms went bankrupt. Some investors who purchased stocks in January 2020 lost more than half of their entire investment within a month or two.

ECONOMIC IMPACT
However, the federal government attempted to stimulate the economy by providing extra benefits to unemployed people. In addition, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to very low levels, such that potential homeowners could obtain mortgage loans at a 3% rate. This triggered a huge demand for homes, which helped to create new jobs in the housing market. As a result of the stimulus provided by the federal government (including the Federal Reserve), stock prices rallied. From April 2020 through 2021, stocks rose by more than 80% on average. Many investors who invested in stocks in March 2020 doubled their money within 18 months.

Measuring an Investment’s Risk
Investors measure the risk of investments to determine the degree of uncertainty surrounding their future returns. Two common measures of an investment’s risk are its range of returns and the standard deviation of its returns. These measures, which can be applied to investments whose prices are frequently quoted over time, are explained next.

Range of Returns
By reviewing the monthly returns of a specific investment over a given period, you can determine the range of returns, from the smallest (most negative) to the largest return. Compare an investment that has a range of monthly returns from 0.2% to 1.4% over the last year with another investment that has a range of 
−

%
 to 4.3%. The first investment is less risky because its range of returns is smaller, and therefore it is more stable. Investments with a wide range have greater potential for a high return but have more risk because they have a higher probability of experiencing a large decline in price.

range of returns
The returns of a specific investment over a given period.

Standard Deviation of Returns
A second measure of risk is the standard deviation of a stock’s monthly returns, which measures the degree of volatility in the stock’s returns over time. A large standard deviation means that the returns deviate substantially from its mean return over time. The more volatile the returns, the greater the chance that the stock could deviate far from its mean in a given period. Thus, an investment with a high standard deviation is more likely to experience a large gain or a large loss in a given period. The investment’s return is subject to greater uncertainty, and for this reason it is perceived as riskier.

standard deviation
The degree of volatility in the stock’s returns over time.

Although these two measures differ, they tend to rank the risk levels of stocks rather consistently. That is, a very risky stock will normally have a relatively wide range of returns and a high standard deviation of returns.

Subjective Measures of Risk
The use of the range and standard deviation is limited because these measures of risk are not always accurate predictors of the future. For example, an investment that had stable returns in the past period when the economy was stable could experience a substantial decline in price in the future in response to poor economic conditions. Because of this limitation, the risk of some investments is commonly measured subjectively. For instance, the risk of a bond may be measured by a subjective assessment of the issuing firm’s ability to repay its debt. The assessment may include an estimate of the firm’s future monthly revenue to determine whether the firm will have sufficient funds to cover its interest and other expenses. Investors may rely on experts to offer their risk assessment of a particular type of investment.
Trade-Off between Return and Risk
Every individual investor would like investments that offer a high return and have no risk. However, such investments do not exist. Investors must weigh the trade-off between the potential return of an investment and the risk. If you want an investment that may generate a higher return, you have to tolerate the higher degree of uncertainty (risk) associated with that investment.

Return-Risk Trade-Off among Stocks
Some firms have the potential to achieve a much higher performance level than others. But to do so, they take on more risk than other firms. Investors who invest in one of these firms may earn very high returns if the firm’s strategies are successful. However, they could lose most or all of their investment if the firm’s strategies fail.

In general, smaller firms have more potential for fast growth, and their stocks have the potential to increase in value to a greater degree. Yet their stocks are risky because many small firms never reach their potential. The more mature firms that have already achieved high growth have less potential for future growth. However, these firms tend to be less risky because their business is more stable.

IPOs are another stock investment option. You may have heard that IPO returns often exceed 20% over the first day. However, there is great risk to this type of investment. Individual investors rarely have access to IPOs at the initial price. Institutional investors (such as mutual funds or insurance companies with large amounts of money to invest) normally have the first shot at purchasing shares of an IPO. Most individual investors can invest (if there are any shares left) only after the institutional investors have had a chance to purchase shares. By the time individual investors can invest in a newly issued stock, the price has already risen. Thus, individual investors commonly obtain the shares only after the price has reached its peak and might incur large losses as the stock price following the IPO peak price sometimes declines over the following months.

Return-Risk Trade-Off among Bonds
You may invest in a bond issued by a firm to earn a high coupon payment. The risk of your investment is that the firm may be unable to pay its coupon payment if its financial condition deteriorates. If you purchase a bond from a large, well-known, and successful firm, there is minimal risk that the firm will default on its payments. If you purchase a bond issued by a firm that is struggling financially, there is more risk that this firm will default on its payments. If this firm defaults on the bond, you might lose your entire investment.

High-risk bonds tend to offer higher coupon payments. Thus, you must weigh the trade-off between the potential return and the risk. If you are willing to tolerate the higher risk, you may consider investing in a bond issued by a weak firm. Alternatively, if you prefer less risk, you can purchase a bond issued by a successful and established firm, as long as you are willing to accept a lower return on your investment.

Return-Risk Trade-Off among Mutual Funds and ETFs
When you invest in a mutual fund or ETF composed of stocks, you earn a return from the dividend payments and the increase in the prices of stocks held by the fund. The risk of a stock mutual fund or stock ETF is that the prices of stocks can decline in any particular period. Because the fund is composed of numerous stocks, the adverse impact caused by any single stock is reduced. However, when economic conditions weaken, most stocks tend to perform poorly. Just as smaller stocks tend to be riskier than larger stocks, mutual funds and ETFs that contain mostly small stocks are riskier than mutual funds and ETFs containing larger stocks. Yet some investors still prefer mutual funds consisting of small stocks because they expect a higher return from these stocks.

When you invest in a mutual fund or ETF composed of bonds, your primary risk is that the bonds held by the fund could default. Because a bond mutual fund contains numerous bonds, the adverse effect of a single bond default within a mutual fund is reduced. Yet, when economic conditions deteriorate, many firms that issued bonds can experience financial problems and have difficulty making their coupon payments. Some bond mutual funds are not highly exposed to risk because they invest only in corporate bonds issued by the most creditworthy corporations. Others are highly exposed because they invest in bonds issued by relatively weak corporations that pay high coupon rates. Investors who prefer risky bond mutual funds or bond ETFs because of their potential to offer a high return must tolerate the high level of risk.

Return-Risk Trade-Off among Real Estate Investments
When you invest in real estate, your risk depends on your particular investment. If you buy rental property, it may not generate your anticipated periodic income if you cannot find renters or if your renters default on their rent payment. In addition, there is a risk that the property’s value will decline over time. The degree of risk varies with the type of real estate investment. If you purchase an office building that is fully occupied, the risk is relatively low, although the value of the building could decline over time. Conversely, if you purchase a piece of open land in New Mexico because you hope that you will someday discover oil on the land, there is great risk in this investment.

Comparing Different Types of Investments
As a prudent investor, you must choose investments that suit your personal objectives. If you want to achieve a fixed return over a short-term period without any risk, you should consider investing in a CD at a financial institution. The disadvantage of this investment is that it offers a relatively low return.

If you want to achieve a stable return over a long-term period, you should consider Treasury bonds or mutual funds that contain Treasury bonds. At the other extreme, if you desire a very high return, you could consider investing in land or in some small stocks.

Many investors fall in between these two extremes. They prefer a higher return than is offered by CDs or Treasury bonds but want to limit their risk. There is no formula that can determine your ideal investment because the choice depends on how much risk you want to take and on your financial situation.
To illustrate, consider the following situations and the possible solutions shown in Exhibit 14.1. These solutions may seem boring, but boring is good if the investment allows you to earn a safe return until you need to use the money in the future. There are alternative investment strategies that would be more exciting because they could quickly double your money, but they could also cause you to lose your entire investment, which would prevent you from using your money in the future.

Exhibit 14.1 How Investment Decisions Vary with Your Situation

Figure 14.1 Full Alternative Text
In general, you are in a better position to take some risk when you know that you will not need to sell the investment in the near future. Even if the value of the investment declines, you have the flexibility to hold on to the investment until the value increases. Conversely, individuals investing for the short term should play it safe. Because the prices of risky investments fluctuate substantially, it is dangerous to invest in a risky investment when you know that you will be selling that investment in the near future. You could be forced to sell it when the investment has a low value. Investors who decide to pursue higher potential returns must be willing to accept the high risk associated with these investments.

By keeping a variety of investments, you can find a tolerable risk level. You can diversify your investments among many different stocks, thereby reducing your exposure to any particular investment. If you divide your money equally among five investments and one investment performs poorly, your exposure is limited.

Even if you diversify your portfolio among various investments, you are still exposed to general economic conditions, as the values of all investments can decline during periods in which economic conditions are weak. For this reason, you should consider diversifying among various types of investments that are not equally sensitive to economic conditions. The strategy of diversification is crucial for investors and is given more attention in Chapter 18.
Learning from Investment Mistakes
Many individual investors learn from their own mistakes or from the mistakes of others. Consider the following investment mistakes, so that you can avoid them.

Making Decisions Based on Unrealistic Goals
One of the most common mistakes is letting unrealistic goals dictate your investment decisions. These goals may lead you to take more risks than you should and can result in major losses.

Example
Lori has $4,000, which should cover her school expenses next year. She is considering investing the money in a one-year CD that would earn about 6%, or about $240 in interest, before next year. However, she would like to earn a higher return on her money within the next year so that she can buy a used car. She decides to invest in a small stock that earned a return of 50% last year. If the stock’s value increases by 50% again, her investment would generate a gain of $2,000, which would allow her to buy a used car. Unfortunately, the stock’s value declines by 30% over the year. At the end of the year, her investment is worth $2,800, a $1,200 loss. She does not have sufficient funds to buy the car or cover her school expenses. She did not view her investment as a gamble, as the money was invested in the stock of a firm. However, her investment in one small stock was just as risky as gambling, especially because she had no information to support her decision except for the fact that the stock performed well in the previous year.

Borrowing to Invest
Another common mistake is to invest money that could have been used to pay off an existing loan. The potential to earn a high return on an investment can tempt individuals to take more risks than they should.

Example
Carlos recently took out a $5,000 loan to cover this year’s college expenses. His parents gave him $5,000 so that he could pay off the loan. Rather than pay off the loan, Carlos invested the $5,000 in a stock. He had hoped that he could earn a large return on the $5,000 so that he could sell the investment at the end of the year, pay off the loan, and have enough funds to travel through Europe during the summer. During the year, he had to make interest payments on the existing loan. The stock that he purchased declined in value by 90%, leaving him with just $500 at the end of the year. He now has insufficient funds to take a vacation or to pay off the loan.

Taking Risks to Recover Losses
Another common mistake is taking excessive risks to recover your losses. This can lead to additional losses and may even push individuals toward bankruptcy.

Example
Sarah lost 10% of her investment in the last year from investing in a diversified mutual fund. She needs the money before next winter to purchase a new furnace for her home. Yet she wants to make up for her loss and has shifted her money into a risky mutual fund that will likely generate a higher return if economic conditions are favorable, but will perform poorly if economic conditions are unfavorable. She experiences a 20% loss on this investment because economic conditions weakened. She no longer has sufficient funds to pay for the furnace.

In some periods, many investors bid up the prices of stocks because of their unrealistic expectations about how well these stocks would perform in the future. The media hype adds to the investors’ irrational exuberance. These actions create a so-called speculative bubble, meaning that once the prices are blown up to a certain level, the speculative bubble will burst, and stock prices will decline to where they should be. One reason for the generally poor stock performance in some periods was that such a speculative bubble burst. Although there may be periods in the future during which stocks or other investments earn abnormally high returns, you should be realistic when making investment decisions. An investment that has the potential to rise substantially in value also has the potential to decline substantially in value. If you cannot afford the possible loss, you should not make that investment.

Summary
PAYING OFF DEBT BEFORE INVESTING. Before investing money, consider whether the funds should be used to pay off your debt, especially if the debt has a high interest rate. By using funds to pay off debt with a high interest rate, you avoid paying that rate on your debt. Thus, using the funds in this manner is essentially earning the rate of return that you would have been paying on the debt you paid off. In future months, your net cash inflows increase by the amount of money you would have needed to make loan payments if you had not paid off the debt.

TYPES OF INVESTMENTS. Common types of investments include money market securities, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate. Each type of investment is unique in how it provides a return to its investors.

MEASURING RETURN ON INVESTMENT. The return on an investment is determined by the income that the investment generates and the capital gain of the investment over the investment horizon. Some stocks offer periodic income in the form of dividends, whereas bonds offer periodic income in the form of coupon payments.

RISK OF INVESTMENTS. The risk from making an investment varies among types of investments. In particular, money market securities tend to have lower risk, and many stocks and real estate investments have higher risk. However, the risk also varies within a particular type of investment. Some stocks have more risk than others. Investors measure the risk of investments to determine the degree of uncertainty surrounding their future returns. Two common measures of an investment’s risk are its range of returns and the standard deviation of its returns. When an investment has a very large range or standard deviation of returns, its possible future returns are more dispersed or unpredictable. This implies more risk or uncertainty surrounding its future return.

RETURN-RISK TRADE-OFFS. Investors weigh the trade-off between return and risk when making investments. When they select investments that have the potential to offer high returns, they must accept a higher degree of risk. Alternatively, they can select investments with lower risk, but they must accept a relatively low return. The proper choice is dependent on the investor’s willingness to accept risk, which is influenced by the investor’s financial position. Some investors are not in a financial position in which they can afford to take much risk and should therefore select investments with little or no risk.

COMMON INVESTMENT MISTAKES. You can learn from investment mistakes made by others. In particular, do not make investments that are driven by unrealistic goals. Do not invest when the funds could be more properly used to pay off existing debt. Do not attempt high-risk investments as a means of recovering recent losses. Recognize the risk of making investments that may be experiencing a speculative bubble.

HOW PERSONAL INVESTING FITS INTO YOUR FINANCIAL PLAN. Personal investing allows you to accumulate more wealth to achieve various future spending or retirement goals, and therefore it can help you complete your financial plan.
