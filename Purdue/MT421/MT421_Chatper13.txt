Maria quit her job to care for her young children. Shortly after she stopped working, her husband, Diego, was killed in an auto accident. It was only then that Maria fully appreciated the benefit of the $400,000 life insurance policy that they had purchased. Shortly after their first child was born, their neighbor, an insurance agent, had approached Maria and Diego. The agent told them that because Diego was the sole provider for the family, he needed a sizable insurance policy to replace his income in the event of his death. The insurance they bought is enough to cover expenses until well after the children are in school and Maria reenters the workforce.

Without life insurance, the death of a breadwinner eliminates some or all of the household’s employment income. Life insurance can provide financial protection for members of a household.

Background on Life Insurance
Life insurance provides a payment to a specified beneficiary when the policyholder dies. In this way, it allows you to provide financial support to specified beneficiaries in the event of your death. A $100,000 policy means that if you die, the beneficiary named in your policy will receive $100,000. The amount received by the beneficiary is not taxed.

Life insurance is provided by life insurance companies, which may be independent firms or subsidiaries of financial conglomerates. Many financial institutions that provide banking and brokerage services also have a subsidiary that provides life insurance. You pay a premium on a periodic (such as quarterly) basis for life insurance.

Role of Life Insurance
The most common financial goal related to life insurance is to maintain financial support for your dependents. Life insurance is critical to protecting a family’s financial situation if a breadwinner dies. It provides the family with support to cover burial expenses or medical expenses not covered by health insurance. Life insurance can also maintain the family’s lifestyle in the future, even without a breadwinner’s income. In addition, it may help dependents pay off any accumulated debt. If you are a breadwinner and have others who rely on your income, you should have life insurance.

If no one else relies on your income, life insurance may not be necessary. For example, if you and your spouse both work full-time and your spouse could be self-sufficient without your income, life insurance is not as important. If you are single and are not providing financial support to anyone, you may not need life insurance.

However, many individuals without dependents still want to leave money to their heirs. For example, you may decide that you want to finance your nephew’s college education. If you die before your nephew attends college, a life insurance policy can achieve your goal. Alternatively, you may want to provide financial support for your parents. In this case, you can designate your parents as the beneficiaries of a life insurance policy. You can even set up a life insurance policy that designates your favorite charity as the beneficiary.

As time passes, rethink your life insurance decisions. Even if you decide not to purchase life insurance now, you may require life insurance in the future. If you already have a life insurance policy, you may need to increase the coverage or add a new or different beneficiary in the future.

Psychology Behind the Life Insurance Decision
PSYCHOLOGY of Personal Finance

Psychology can discourage people from deciding to buy life insurance. It is natural human behavior to focus on more enjoyable events such as a wedding or a vacation instead of death. Thus, people tend to defer the decision to buy life insurance because they do not want to consider it. In addition, the decision to buy life insurance will result in periodic payments, and people may feel that there is no immediate benefit or satisfaction in return. People would rather spend their money on products or services that provide an immediate benefit. This psychological effect might explain why about one-fourth of all households in the United States do not have any life insurance. According to a recent Forbes survey, more than 50% of all households in the United States without life insurance feel financially insecure, while 32% of households with life insurance feel financially insecure.

To overcome these obstacles, parents should consider what would happen to their children if they died. While they might already have a plan for who would be the legal guardian, they should also consider whether the legal guardian could afford to provide a desirable lifestyle for the children. Life insurance can ensure that if the parents die, their children will receive sufficient financial support.

Although your decision to buy life insurance is not as enjoyable as buying clothes or stocks, in the long run it can be more rewarding. The first step is to invest time by reading this chapter on life insurance and then deciding whether you should consider buying life insurance to protect the financial future of your loved ones.

Role of Life Insurance Companies
Many insurance companies can provide you with life insurance coverage. They can explain the different types of life insurance that are available and help you determine the type of life insurance that would satisfy your needs. They can also help you determine the amount of coverage that you need. Many people who purchase life insurance will be alive 40 or more years after they purchase the policy, and they rely on the life insurance company to provide the benefits on their death in the future. Thus, the company must be financially sound to continue to exist and fulfill its insurance contracts for its policyholders in the distant future.
Applying for Life Insurance
To apply for life insurance, you fill out a detailed application form with information about your medical history and lifestyle that is used to determine your eligibility and premium. If you suffer from a chronic illness such as diabetes or heart disease or are a smoker, your premium will be higher. You may be tempted to omit some information so that you can pay a lower premium. As part of the application process, you will most likely go through a medical exam. Between the exam and information available from the Medical Information Bureau, a clearinghouse of medical information that insurers share, the insurer will most likely uncover any inaccuracies in your application.

If your application does slip through with inaccuracies, your insurance benefits could be eliminated. The policy is a legal contract between you and the insurance company, so you must be truthful. It is not worth jeopardizing the peace of mind that life insurance offers by trying to save a relatively small amount on premiums.
Types of Life Insurance
Although the needs for life insurance are straightforward, there are many options for policies. Term insurance, whole life insurance, and universal life insurance are the most popular types of life insurance.

Term Insurance
Term insurance is life insurance provided over a specified time period. The term is typically from 5 to 20 years. Term insurance does not build a cash value, meaning that the policy does not serve as an investment. It is intended strictly to provide insurance to a beneficiary in the event of death. If the insured person remains alive over the term, the policy expires at the end of the term and has no value.

Consider the case of Joanna, a single mother with three young children. She plans to provide financial support for her children until they complete their college education. Although Joanna’s income is sufficient to provide that support, she wants backup support if she dies. She decides to purchase 20-year term insurance. If she dies during this period, her children will receive the coverage specified in the policy. If she is still living at the end of the term, the policy will expire. Even under these conditions, the policy would have served its purpose, giving Joanna peace of mind over the period by ensuring sufficient financial support for her children. Once the term expires, the children will be old enough to support themselves financially.

Premiums on Term Insurance
Insurance companies may require that the premium on term insurance be paid monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. If the premium is not paid by the due date, the policyholder is given a grace period. If the premium is not paid during the grace period, the policy will be terminated.

Determinants of Term Insurance Premiums
The annual insurance premiums for term insurance vary based on several factors. First, the longer the term of the policy, the longer the period in which the insurance company must provide coverage, and the higher the annual premium.

Second, the older the policyholder, the higher the policy premium. Older people are more likely to die within a given term. Exhibit 13.1 provides a sampling of quoted annual premiums (based on a policyholder with no unusual medical problems) for a term insurance policy ($500,000, 20-year policy, for nonsmokers). The actual premiums will vary among life insurance companies, but the general comparison described here still holds. Notice from Exhibit 13.1 that the annual premium for a 45-year-old is more than twice that of a 35-year-old. In addition, the annual premium for a 60-year-old is more than four times that of a 45-year-old.
Exhibit 13.1 How the Annual Premium Changes with Age (for Nonsmoking Men with $500,000 Coverage)

Figure 13.1 Full Alternative Text
Third, the greater the insurance coverage (benefits upon death), the higher the insurance premiums. Exhibit 13.2 illustrates the annual premiums separately for female and male profiles based on various coverage levels. Notice that the annual premium for a $500,000 policy is more than 50% above the $100,000 policy for both profiles. This exhibit also shows that annual premiums for women are lower than those for men, which is due to women’s longer life expectancy.

Exhibit 13.2 How Annual Premiums Differ Based on Coverage Level and Sex

Figure 13.2 Full Alternative Text
Fourth, the annual premium is higher for people assigned male at birth than for people of the same age assigned female at birth. A 40-year-old man would pay an annual premium of about $360 for a 20-year $500,000 coverage policy, whereas a 40-year-old woman would pay an annual premium of about $304 for the same policy. In general, the quoted annual premiums for a particular term insurance policy are between 15% and 25% higher for men than for women of the same age. Note that insurers may have different practices in terms of whether they charge premiums based on sex assigned at birth, gender as reported on official identifications documents, or self-reported gender.

Fifth, the annual premium is substantially larger for smokers than for nonsmokers. For example, controlling for sex, the degree of coverage, and age, the annual life insurance premium of smokers is normally two to three times higher than that of nonsmokers.
Sixth, the annual premium may be much larger for policyholders who have existing medical conditions or have a family history of medical problems. In general, the longer the period in which a medical condition has existed, the higher the annual premium that the policyholder will pay.

Reviewing Premiums on Term Insurance Using the Internet
A term insurance premium for a given person can vary among life insurance companies because some companies may be more competitive than others, so it is worthwhile to compare premiums among companies when shopping for life insurance. Some life insurance companies provide quotes for term insurance on their websites. You would need to provide information such as your date of birth, your state of residency, the amount of coverage, and the length of the term of insurance and answer some general questions about your health. You can even adjust the amount of insurance coverage if you want to determine how the premium is affected by alternative levels of coverage.

Visit websites such as www.insure.com, www.esurance.com, or www.nerdwallet.com to obtain quotes from various life insurance companies based on your specified needs. First, the sites request some information as described earlier, and then they list various quotes on term insurance from different companies. This allows you to select the company that you believe would accommodate your needs. You can link to the policy contract of that company and may be able to access the name and phone number of a company representative. The value of this type of website is that it may help you obtain quotes without being subjected to a sales pitch. Once you have screened the list of possible insurance companies, you can speak to an insurance agent before you select a company. Also, assess the financial soundness of the company that you select.

Decreasing-Term Insurance
A common type of term insurance is decreasing-term insurance, in which the insurance benefits to the beneficiary are reduced over time. The premium paid for the insurance remains constant over the term. This type of insurance is popular for families because it provides a relatively high level of insurance in the earlier years when it is most needed. As time passes, a family can accumulate savings, pay off part of a mortgage, and increase their investments, so smaller life insurance benefits are needed. Several forms of decreasing-term insurance are available, with different terms and different degrees to which the insurance benefits decrease over the term. The same factors that affect the premium of term insurance also affect the premium of decreasing-term insurance.

decreasing-term insurance
A form of term insurance in which the benefits that will be paid to the beneficiary are reduced over time and the premium remains constant.

Mortgage Life Insurance
Mortgage life insurance pays off a policyholder’s mortgage in the event of their death. It is commonly purchased to ensure that a family can afford to continue living in their home even if a breadwinner dies. Mortgage insurance is a special form of decreasing-term insurance. Individuals can achieve the same goal by purchasing a regular term insurance policy that provides benefits large enough to pay off the mortgage.

Life insurance that pays off a mortgage in the event of the policyholder’s death.
Group Term Insurance
Group term insurance is term insurance provided to a designated group of people with a common bond, such as the same employer. Group term insurance premiums are usually lower than the typical premiums an individual would pay because the insured receives a group discount. Some companies that have a group plan may pay for term insurance for their employees as a benefit.

group term insurance
Term insurance with generally lower than typical premiums that is available to people within a defined group.

Whole Life Insurance
Whole life insurance (sometimes referred to as permanent insurance) continues to provide insurance as long as premiums are paid; the policy accumulates savings for the policyholder over time. In this way, it not only provides benefits to a beneficiary if the policyholder dies but also creates a form of savings with a cash value. For this reason, whole life insurance is sometimes referred to as cash-value life insurance.

whole life insurance (permanent insurance)
Life insurance that continues to provide insurance as long as premiums are paid; it not only provides benefits to the beneficiary but also has a cash value.

The cash value is typically specified on a schedule. If you buy a policy, your whole life insurance premium is a fixed amount that is used for two purposes: life insurance and savings. A portion of the premium pays for the life insurance provided by the policy so that the beneficiaries you identify in the policy will be covered if you die. The remainder of the premium is invested for you as a form of savings that builds a cash value over time. If you withdraw the cash, the amount by which the cash value exceeds the premiums that were paid is subject to taxes.

You can change your policy by using your cash value to make a one-time payment for a new policy. The death benefit of the new policy is dependent on the cash value amount of the policy that you exchange.

A whole life insurance policy can serve as a source of liquidity. You can borrow against the cash value at an interest rate specified in the policy. However, recognize that this type of loan reduces the cash value of your insurance policy.

Whole Life Insurance Premiums
Many insurance policies allow the premium to be paid monthly, quarterly, or annually. The premium on whole life insurance is constant for the duration of the policy. In the earlier years, a portion of the premium paid for the insurance reflects the potential payout to a beneficiary someday, and the remainder is invested by the insurance company as a form of savings. The portion of the premium dedicated to savings is high in the earlier years when the policyholder is young, because the portion of the premium needed to insure against the possibility of death is relatively low. In the later years, the premium required to insure against possible death is relatively high, as the likelihood of death is greater. Because the insurance premium is constant, it does not cover the amount needed to insure against possible death in the later years. Thus, a portion of the policy’s cash value is used to supplement the premium paid in these years.

If you do not pay a premium on your whole life policy, the insurance company will (with your consent) draw from the cash value of your policy to cover the premium.

Determinants of Whole Life Insurance Premiums
The premiums among whole life policies can vary substantially. Because a whole life policy provides life insurance coverage, the annual premiums are also influenced by the same factors that affect the amount of term insurance premiums. In particular, the quoted annual premiums are higher when the applicant is a man who smokes, is over 60 years old, and requires a larger amount of insurance coverage.

Forms of Whole Life Insurance
Many alternative forms of whole life insurance are available, so you can structure the premium payments in a manner that fits your needs. One such policy is a limited payment policy that allows you to pay premiums over a specified period but remain insured for life. For example, you could make payments until you retire, but continue to be insured after retirement. If you are 45 years old and plan to retire at age 65, this means you would request a payment period of 20 years. The insurance premiums are larger than if you were required to pay premiums continuously, but you build a large cash value during the payment period. Once the payment period ends, the savings you accumulated within the whole life policy are used to cover your future premiums.

limited payment policy
A policy that allows you to pay premiums over a specified period but remain insured for life.

Alternatively, a whole life policy can be structured to provide a higher level of death benefits to the beneficiaries in the earlier years of the policy. For example, it may specify insurance coverage of $300,000 over the next 10 years and $100,000 of coverage after 10 year. This type of policy may be useful for policyholders who have young children. The coverage is higher in the years when the children are young and unable to take care of themselves.

Comparison to Term Insurance
Premiums for whole life insurance are higher than premiums for term insurance. The advantage of whole life insurance over term insurance is that it not only provides insurance against possible death, but also accumulates savings over time. However, you can accumulate savings on your own by purchasing term insurance with lower premiums and then investing the difference.

Some people may prefer whole life insurance because it forces them to save money and accumulate funds. However, it is a relatively inefficient way to save money. They may be better off establishing a routine to automatically deposit a portion of each paycheck in a bank account, to force some level of savings over time.

The choice of term insurance versus whole life insurance is dependent on your particular needs. If you only need life insurance to insure beneficiaries in the event of your death, term insurance is probably more appropriate.

If you live beyond the term stated in a term insurance policy, you would have to pay a higher annual premium when establishing a new term insurance policy. Conversely, the premium for the basic whole life policy remains constant. Nevertheless, term insurance is typically a less expensive way to meet your life insurance needs.

Universal Life Insurance
Universal life insurance provides insurance over a specified term and accumulates savings for policyholders over this time. It is a combination of term insurance and a savings plan. Because it allows policyholders to build savings, it is classified as a cash-value life insurance policy.

universal life insurance
Life insurance that provides insurance over a specified term and accumulates savings for the policyholder over this time.

Universal life insurance policies allow “term riders” so you can temporarily increase the level of insurance for a particular period. For example, if you needed an extra $100,000 of insurance coverage over the next five years, you could purchase a term rider to provide the additional coverage.

Universal life insurance allows policyholders to alter their payments over time. It specifies the premium needed to cover the term insurance portion. When policyholders pay more than that amount, the extra amount is invested in savings on which policyholders earn interest.

Unlike whole life insurance policies where the insurance company makes the investment decisions, policyholders are given a choice of investments that are administered by the insurance company and can decide how the savings plan funds are to be invested. If policyholders skip premium payments, the amount needed to cover the term insurance portion or any administrative expenses will be withdrawn from their savings plan.

Variable Life Insurance
One type of universal life insurance is called variable life insurance, which allows policyholders to invest the residual funds after the premium payment on the term portion is paid in various types of investments, some of which are similar to mutual funds. Variable life insurance differs from whole life insurance in that it allows policyholders to make their own investment decisions.

variable life insurance
Life insurance that provides insurance over a specified term and allows policyholders to invest residual funds, after the premium on the term portion is paid, in various types of investments.

An advantage of variable life insurance is that it provides policyholders with some flexibility in making their payments and in deciding how the savings should be invested. However, the fees on variable life insurance can be high. You can achieve the same benefits by simply purchasing term insurance and investing other funds in the manner you prefer, without incurring the high administrative fees that you pay for variable life insurance.
Because variable life policyholders can choose to have their savings plan invested in stocks, their cash value is influenced by stock market conditions. When the COVID-19 pandemic reached the United States in early 2020, the U.S. economy weakened and the U.S. stock market suffered a major decline. Consequently, cash values of variable life insurance policies dipped in the first few months of 2020. However, the stock market rebounded as the U.S. government implemented a stimulus package with extra unemployment compensation and lower market interest rates that resulted in very low mortgage rates and a strong demand for homes. As a result, the cash values of variable life insurance companies increased.
Determining the Amount of Life Insurance Needed
Once you identify the policy type that best suits your needs, your next decision is the policy amount. You can determine the amount of life insurance you need by applying the income method or the budget method, as explained next.

Income Method
The income method is a general formula for determining how much life insurance you should maintain based on your income. This method normally specifies the life insurance amount as a multiple of your annual income, such as 10 times your annual income. For example, if you have an annual income of $40,000, this formula would suggest that you need $400,000 in life insurance. This method is very easy to use. The disadvantage is that it does not consider your age and your family circumstances (including your annual household expenses). Thus, it does not differentiate between a household with no children and one with children, which will likely need more life insurance because its expenses will be higher.

income method
A method that determines how much life insurance is needed based on the policyholder’s annual income.

Example
The Tamura household earns $50,000 per year. The Carlin household also earns $50,000. Both households rely on a neighbor who sells insurance for advice and were told that they should have coverage of 10 times their annual income. However, the Tamura household’s financial situation is completely different from that of the Carlin household. The Tamuras are in their early 30s; they have two very young children and plan on having more. They have large credit card balances, two car loans, and a mortgage loan. Their $50,000 income barely covers their existing expenses, and they have very little savings.

The Carlins do not have any children. They are in their late 50s and both work part-time. They have established a very large amount of savings and a substantial retirement account, so they could retire now if they had to. They have completely paid off their mortgage and do not have any other debt.

Given the distinct differences in their financial conditions, the insurance coverage should not be the same for both households. The Tamuras should apply a higher multiple of their annual income, while the Carlins should apply a lower multiple. Some insurance agents would likely suggest that the Tamuras use a multiple such as 20, so their life insurance would be 
20
×
$
50,000
=
$
1,000,000
.
 The Carlins may use a much smaller multiple such as 6, so their life insurance coverage would be 
6
×
$
50,000
=
$
300,000
.

This example illustrates why the income method is limited for determining the appropriate amount of life insurance. Furthermore, even if the multiple is adjusted to reflect the budget situation of the policyholder, the adjustment is still arbitrary.

Budget Method
An alternative method is the budget method (also referred to as the needs method), which determines your life insurance needs by considering your future budget based on your household’s expected future expenses and your current financial situation. This method requires a little more effort than the income method to determine the necessary insurance coverage. However, it provides a better estimate than the income method. The main reason for having life insurance is to ensure that a household’s needs are covered in the event of death, not just to replace lost income. The budget method estimates the amount of future funds that will be needed so that the insurance coverage will be adequate. Some important factors that should be considered when determining needs follow:

ANNUAL LIVING EXPENSES. You should have sufficient insurance so that your family can live comfortably without your income. Your family’s future expenses will be higher if you have children. Younger children will need financial support for a longer period of time.

SPECIAL FUTURE EXPENSES. If you want to ensure a college education for your children, you need adequate life insurance to cover the expected future expenses.

DEBT. If your family relies on your income to cover debt, you may want to ensure that your life insurance can pay off credit card bills and even a mortgage.

JOB MARKETABILITY OF YOUR SPOUSE. If your spouse has very limited job marketability, you may need more life insurance so that your spouse can receive job training.

VALUE OF EXISTING SAVINGS. If you have accumulated a large amount of savings, your family may draw interest or dividends from these savings to cover a portion of their periodic expenses. The more savings your household has accumulated, the less life insurance you need.

A method that determines how much life insurance is needed based on the household’s expected future expenses.
Using the Internet to Determine Your Insurance Coverage
Some insurance companies’ websites allow you to determine your beneficiary’s needs so that you can decide on the amount of insurance coverage necessary. They ask you to provide basic information such as your total amount of debt, how much annual income you want your family to receive on your death, and how many years you want the income to last. These sites may even allow you to specify the amount of funds that you wish to provide for the education of your family members.

Example
You wish to purchase a life insurance policy that generates a pre-tax income of at least $30,000 per year for the next 20 years to cover living expenses (excluding the mortgage payment) for your spouse and two children if you die while they are still young. You anticipate no unusual expenses for the household in the future. Assume that you expect your spouse will be able to earn at least 6% annually by investing the money received from the life insurance policy.

To determine your insurance needs, you must estimate the amount of insurance today that can provide an annuity equal to $30,000 over each of the next 20 years. That is, you want to solve the present value of a $30,000 annual annuity that would continue for 20 years. The present value that you derive would be the life insurance that your family would need to spend $30,000 per year for the next 20 years. The process of solving the present value of an annuity was explained in Chapter 3.

You can rely on a table showing the present value interest factor of an annuity 
(
𝑃
𝑉
𝐼
𝐹
𝐴
)
 for various interest rate levels and annuity terms. Using Table C.4 in Appendix C, notice that the 
PVIFA

 and

 is 11.47. The present value of the annuity 
(

 can be estimated as:

$
344,100
Thus, the present amount of $344,100 could provide $30,000 per year for the next 20 years for your spouse and two children.

You could also solve this problem with a financial calculator. In this example, the focus is on solving the present value. The future value is not relevant, so set its value to zero.

The annuity of $30,000 can be input using the PMT key and making the number negative. For this specific problem, think of the present value number as a positive lump sum payment representing the life insurance proceeds. Think of the annuity (with a negative number) as the amount that your family would need to spend each year with the proceeds of the life insurance lump sum payment. Thus, the financial calculator is determining the amount of life insurance that your family would need today if you die so that they could use the money to spend $30,000 per year for the next 30 years.

In some cases, you may want your life insurance to cover some additional future expenses beyond covering the $30,000 in annual expenses over the next 20 years, as was just described. Continue with the previous example, but assume that in addition to the insurance that would provide a 20-year annuity of $30,000, you also want your life insurance policy to cover the following additional future expenses:

OTHER SPECIAL FUTURE EXPENSES. You want to allocate an extra $50,000 in life insurance that would help to cover some college expenses for your two children.

JOB TRAINING. You want to have additional insurance of $20,000 to ensure that your spouse can pay for job training in the event of your death.

DEBT. You have a $60,000 mortgage and no other loans or credit card debt outstanding. You decide to increase the life insurance amount so that the mortgage can be paid off if you die. Therefore, you specify an extra $60,000 in life insurance.

Your additional preferences will require an additional $130,000 in life insurance

 So, when considering this additional insurance along with the life insurance amount ($344,100) needed to generate the 20-year annuity, you need a total of 
$

344,100

474,100
 in life insurance. You could round off the number and obtain quotes for policies with coverage of $475,000 or $500,000.

Limitations in Estimating Needs
When using the budget method to decide needs, keep in mind that the amount of funds you will need is subject to a great amount of uncertainty. Here are some common reasons why you may underestimate the life insurance coverage that you need:

Someone within your household could experience an unanticipated major illness or disability.

The income level of your household may not rise over time as expected. It could even decline due to layoffs. Many individuals lost their jobs or were assigned fewer work hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, their investments initially declined in value. Thus, their income was less than expected. When estimating expected income, recognize that economic conditions could weaken over time.

Inflation could cause you to underestimate the cost of some needs. For example, you may have identified a home as one of your future needs and estimated that the home would cost $200,000 based on existing home prices. However, the price of a home could double within 10 years. If the insurance policy only provided $200,000 for a home, it might not be sufficient to purchase the kind of home that you desire.

The insurance policy that you purchase today may not provide coverage until many years from now. For households that save money between purchasing a policy and the death of the policyholder, the funding needed from an insurance policy is reduced. However, for households that accumulate more debt every year, the funding needed from an insurance policy increases. Households should consider the potential change in their debt level over time so that they can more accurately estimate the insurance coverage they will need.

As you attempt to determine your needs, account for the uncertainty by recognizing how the values of these needs may be higher under some conditions. For example, allow for the possibility of higher home prices or tuition when you estimate the values of these needs.

ECONOMIC IMPACT

Overestimating your future needs means that you will have more insurance benefits than you need. Underestimating your future needs means you will have less insurance than you need. The insurance benefits would not be adequate to provide the desired standard of living for your family. When accounting for this uncertainty, it is better to overestimate your family’s future needs than to underestimate them.

Distinguishing between Needs and Dreams
Before you estimate your needs, distinguish between needs and dreams. To illustrate, consider a young couple who presently have no savings, but have dreams that a breadwinner’s career path will generate a substantial amount of income and savings over the years so that they can retire by age 55 and live in a large home in a mountain resort town. To achieve their dreams, they might need about $5 million by the time they are 55 years old. However, if a breadwinner dies, their spouse’s life and aspirations may change completely. The dream of a large home in a mountain resort may no longer exist if the couple cannot live there together. The needs to be covered by life insurance should be separated from dreams.

To guide a household in determining needs, you can apply the following logic. First, decide what necessities must be covered for the household to survive and continue its normal standard of living if a breadwinner dies. This exercise can help to determine the minimal desired life insurance coverage.

Next, you may wish to consider some additional preferences beyond necessities, such as having enough money to ensure that the children’s college education is covered. There is an obvious trade-off: The greater the total value of needs if a breadwinner dies, the greater the necessary life insurance coverage, and the higher the life insurance premiums. A higher level of life insurance premiums today results in a smaller amount of funds that could be used for other purposes . In general, households attempt to strike a compromise when identifying their life insurance needs. A breadwinner may desire that the family could enjoy an even higher standard of living than is possible today. However, life insurance is not normally viewed as a means by which the surviving family members can suddenly become rich. Ideally, life insurance can provide the financial support for family members to continue with their lives and pursue their goals, just as if the breadwinner were still alive. 
Contents of a Life Insurance Policy
A life insurance policy contains the following information.

Beneficiary
The named beneficiary receives the benefits when the policyholder dies. You can name multiple beneficiaries and specify how you want the death benefits to be divided. You can also name a contingent beneficiary who would receive the benefits if your primary beneficiary is no longer living. You can change the beneficiary any time you wish, but until you do, the existing contract will be enforced. If you name a person rather than your estate as your beneficiary, the benefits can be paid to the person directly and avoid probate and related expenses.

beneficiary
A person named to receive the benefits of an insurance policy.

Grace Period
The insurance policy specifies the grace period allowed beyond the date when payment is due. The typical grace period is 30 days.

Living Benefits
Some whole life insurance policies allow living benefits (also referred to as accelerated death benefits), in which policyholders can receive a portion of the death benefits under special circumstances, including terminal illness or long-term care needs of the insured.

living benefits (accelerated death benefits)
Benefits that allow the policyholder to receive a portion of death benefits before death.

Nonforfeiture Clause
A key provision of the whole life policy is a nonforfeiture clause, which allows you to use the accumulated cash value if you terminate your whole life policy. You can elect to receive the cash or may be able to direct the funds to purchase a term life insurance contract with a one-time payment. The coverage of the new policy depends on the amount of cash value available.

nonforfeiture clause
A clause that allows you to receive the savings you accumulated if you terminate your whole life policy.

Loans
You can borrow cash from your whole life policy once it has an accumulated cash value. The loan rates are usually lower than rates offered on personal loans.

Incontestability Date
Policies specify a date after which the provisions are incontestable. Until that date, an insurance company can cancel a policy if it determines that some of the information provided by the policyholder is inaccurate.

Renewability Option
A renewability option allows you to renew your term insurance policy for another term (up to an age limit specified in the policy) once the existing term expires. The premium for the next term will be higher than that for the prevailing term because you will be older. In addition, the premium charged in the next term can increase to reflect any change in your health. The advantage of the renewability option is that your renewal is guaranteed. Without a renewability option, you may not be able to renew your insurance if your health has deteriorated. Many term insurance policies include the renewability option at no extra charge. Make sure that this option is available in any term insurance policy that you consider.

An option that allows you to renew your policy for another term once an existing policy expires.

Conversion Option
A conversion option allows you to convert your term insurance policy into a whole life policy that will be in effect for the rest of your life. An insurance policy with a conversion option specifies the period in which the conversion can occur. At the time of this conversion, the premium will be increased, but it will then stay constant for the rest of your life.

An option that allows you to convert your term insurance policy into a different type of policy (called a whole life policy) that will be in effect for the rest of your life.

Settlement Options
Settlement options are the alternative ways beneficiaries can receive life insurance benefits if the insured person dies. Normally, the benefits are not taxed, although there are some exceptions beyond the scope of this text. When you purchase a life insurance policy, you select the settlement option that is most appropriate for your beneficiaries. The appropriate option depends on the needs and other characteristics of the beneficiaries. Some of the common options are identified next.

settlement options
The alternative ways a beneficiary can receive life insurance benefits if the insured person dies.

Lump Sum
A lump-sum settlement provides all the benefits to the beneficiary in a single payment on the death of the insured. A $250,000 life insurance policy would provide $250,000 to the beneficiary in a lump sum. This settlement is often used if the beneficiary is disciplined and will use the proceeds wisely. If the beneficiary does not have sufficient discipline, however, an alternative settlement option may be more appropriate.

lump-sum settlement
A single payment of all the benefits owed to a beneficiary under a life insurance policy.

Installment Payments
The policyholder can elect to use an installment payments settlement, which means that the beneficiary will receive a stream of equal payments over a specified number of years. For example, instead of paying $300,000 to the beneficiary in a lump sum, the policy may specify that the beneficiary will receive annual payments starting at the time of the policyholder’s death and lasting for 10 years. By spreading the amount over time, this settlement option ensures that the beneficiary will not immediately spend the total amount to be received.

The payment of life insurance benefits owed to a beneficiary as a stream of equal payments over a specified number of years.

Interest Payments
The policyholder can also elect to use an interest payments settlement, which means that the amount owed to the beneficiary will be held by the life insurance company for a specified number of years. Until the amount is distributed, the beneficiary will receive periodic interest payments on the amount. Like the installment payments option, this settlement option prevents the beneficiary from quickly spending all of the policy proceeds.

A method of paying life insurance benefits in which the company retains the amount owed for a specified number of years and pays interest to the beneficiary.
Selecting a Life Insurance Company
All life insurance companies are not the same. For this reason, you should research multiple life insurance companies before you select one. Keep the following criteria in mind when you choose a life insurance company.

The Type of Policy That You Want
Although all life insurance companies offer some forms of term insurance and whole life insurance, make sure the company offers the specific type of policy that you want. For example, if you want a 10-year term policy with a settlement option that provides installment payments, select a life insurance company that can accommodate your preference.

Relatively Low Insurance Premiums
The cost of insurance is an important factor to consider when selecting a particular life insurance policy. As you compare the premiums across insurance companies, make sure that the quotes you receive are for comparable policies.

Strong Financial Condition
As mentioned earlier, policyholders rely on a life insurance company to survive in the long run so that it can serve them on their death. If a life insurance company fails, it will not pay the benefits of its policyholders in the future. People who paid life insurance premiums in the past will not receive the benefits that they deserve. Thus, it is important to assess the financial condition of the life insurance company before you purchase an insurance policy.

Some people believe that insurance companies that focus only on life insurance coverage are safer because they are be exposed to potential liability resulting from health insurance or liability claims. For example, assume that you have a life insurance policy with a small company that also provides liability coverage. Suppose that one of its customers is sued and the court system awards $50 million to the plaintiff. If the insurance company cannot afford to cover the claim, it may go bankrupt and therefore could not provide any life insurance benefits in the future. Companies that focus only on life insurance can avoid this type of exposure. Life insurance benefits that must be paid out in the future are more predictable than future benefits payable for liability or health insurance claims.

Many people who are not qualified to judge the financial condition of an insurance company rely on ratings assigned by rating services such as A.M. Best, Moody’s, and Standard & Poor’s. The website www.insure.com provides ratings of many insurance companies at no charge. Only consider insurance companies that are rated highly.

Services
Make sure that the insurance company will provide you with the type of service that you can expect. For example, you may want to ensure that the insurance company can supply convenient online services. If you want to discuss possible changes to your life insurance policy in person, you may consider choosing an insurance company that has a branch close to your residence. You may want to make sure that you are comfortable with the agent employed by the insurance company. Some agents receive certifications when they have completed specialized training, such as the Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) certificate. However, keep in mind that although your policy may be in place at a specific company for many years, the agent may leave the company tomorrow. Your policy does not leave with the agent.

Other Types of Insurance
Some life insurance companies offer all types of insurance, including liability insurance and health insurance. You may want to select a life insurance company that can also provide these other types of insurance, assuming that this company satisfies all other criteria. It is more convenient to have all types of insurance at one company. In addition, you may receive a discount on your life insurance premium if you purchase other types of insurance from the same company.

Summary
BACKGROUND ON LIFE INSURANCE. Life insurance is needed to maintain financial support for your dependents. It can protect a family’s financial situation if a breadwinner dies.

TYPES OF LIFE INSURANCE. Life insurance provides payments to specified beneficiaries if the policyholder dies. Term insurance is strictly intended to provide insurance in the event of the death of the insured, whereas whole life insurance and universal life insurance use a portion of the premium to build cash value. The premiums for whole life and universal life insurance are higher than the premiums for term insurance to account for the portion distributed into a savings plan and for the administrative fees.

DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF LIFE INSURANCE NEEDED. The amount of life insurance that you need can be measured by the income method, in which you attempt to replace the income that would be discontinued due to a breadwinner’s death. The amount of life insurance can be more precisely measured by the budget method, which considers factors such as your household’s future annual living expenses and existing debt.

CONTENTS OF A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY. A life insurance policy specifies provisions regarding the rights of the insured policyholder and the settlement options available to the beneficiaries.

SELECTING A LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY. When selecting a life insurance company, consider whether it offers other types of insurance that you might need, offers the specific provisions in its policy that you desire, charges relatively low premiums on its policies, and has a strong financial condition (is likely to remain in business).

HOW LIFE INSURANCE FITS INTO YOUR FINANCIAL PLAN. Part of your financial plan may be to financially support your family. Life insurance can ensure that financial support is provided for your family in the event of your death. Therefore, life insurance can help you achieve your financial plan.
