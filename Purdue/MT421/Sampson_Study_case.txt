The Sampsons—A Continuing Case: Chapter 1

The Sampsons is a continuing case that occurs at the end of every chapter. You will help the Sampsons develop their financial plan using the key concepts presented in each chapter.

Dave and Sharon Sampson are 30 years old and have two children, who are five and six years old. Since marrying seven years ago, the Sampsons have relied on Dave’s salary, which is currently $50,000 per year. Sharon recently obtained a part-time job that pays an annual salary of $15,000. Now that Sharon is also earning income, they hope to use her income to accumulate savings for their children’s college education in the distant future and also to buy a new car for Sharon, because her existing car is very old and constantly needs repairs.

Help the Sampsons prioritize their financial goals. Specifically, assess whether their primary goal at this point should be saving for their children’s college education in the future versus buying a new car for Sharon.

The Sampsons hope that $1,000 per month of Sharon’s salary can be used to boost their savings. How can they monitor this goal over time to ensure that the money is used in this manner?



The Sampsons—A Continuing Case: Chapter 2

The Sampsons realize that the first step toward achieving their financial goals is to create a budget capturing their monthly cash inflows and outflows. Dave and Sharon’s combined disposable (after-tax) income is now about $5,000 per month.

Reviewing their bank statement from last month, Dave and Sharon identify the following monthly household payments:

$1,100 for home expenses (including the mortgage payment, home insurance, and property taxes)

$100 for Internet

$200 for electricity and water

$200 for cellular expenses

$800 for groceries

$200 for health care expenses

The Sampsons also review several credit card bills to estimate their other typical monthly expenses:

About $300 for clothing

About $400 for car expenses (insurance, maintenance, and gas)

About $200 for school expenses

About $900 for recreation and programs for the children

To determine their net worth, the Sampsons also assess their assets and liabilities, which include the following:

$2,000 in their checking account

Home valued at $150,000

Furniture worth about $3,000

Sharon’s car, which needs to be replaced soon, is worth about $1,000; Dave’s car is worth approximately $8,000

They owe $130,000 on their home mortgage


Using the information in the case, prepare a personal cash flow statement for the Sampsons.

The Sampsons hope to have net cash flows of $1,000 per month so that they can add $1,000 per month to their savings. Based on their personal cash flow statement for last month, were the Sampsons able to meet their goal of saving $1,000? If not, how do you recommend that they revise their personal cash flow statement to achieve their savings goal? Is there any particular cash outflow that seems unusually large that could be reduced?

Prepare a personal balance sheet for the Sampsons.

The Sampsons—A Continuing Case: Chapter 3

""

Dave and Sharon Sampson recently established a plan to save $300 per month (or $3,600 per year) for their children’s education. Their oldest child is six years old and will begin college in 12 years. They will invest the $300 in a savings account that they expect will earn interest of about 2% per year over the next 12 years. The Sampsons wonder how much additional money they would accumulate if they could earn 5% per year on the savings account instead of 2%. They also wonder how their savings would accumulate if they could save $400 per month (or $4,800 per year) instead of $300 per month.

Help the Sampsons determine how much they will have for the children’s education by calculating how much $3,600 in annual savings will accumulate to if they earn interest of (a) 2% and (b) 5%. Next, determine how much $4,800 in annual savings will accumulate to if they earn interest of (a) 2% and (b) 5%.

What is the impact of the higher interest rate of 5% (instead of 2%) on the Sampsons’ accumulated savings?

What is the impact of the higher savings of $4,800 (instead of $3,600) on their accumulated savings?

If the Sampsons set a goal to save $70,000 for their children’s college education in 12 years, how would you determine the yearly savings necessary to achieve this goal? How much would they have to save by the end of each year to achieve this goal, assuming a 5% annual interest rate?

Dave and Sharon Sampson want to determine their taxes for this year. Their combined income will be $65,000 for the year. They did not make any individual retirement account (IRA) contributions. The Sampsons are filing jointly.

Help the Sampsons estimate their Federal Income Contributions Act (FICA) tax, which consists of Social Security and Medicare taxes.

Recall that the Sampsons would like to save a total of $1,000 per month for a down payment on a new car that they will purchase for Sharon within a year. They also hope to save money each month for their children’s college education, which begins 12 years from now. They notice that their local bank offers the certificate of deposit (CD) rates listed in the following table; they now need to determine if they should invest in CDs, and if so, which CDs will best suit their savings goals.

Maturity	Annualized Interest Rate (%)
1 month	5.0
3 months	5.2
6 months	5.0
1 year	5.0
3 years	4.8
5 years	4.6
7 years	4.6
10 years	 
Advise the Sampsons on the maturity to select if they decide to invest their savings in a CD for a down payment on a car. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the maturity that you recommend the Sampsons use for this purpose.

Advise the Sampsons on the maturity to select if they decide to invest their savings in CDs for their children’s education. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the maturity that you recommend the Sampsons use for this purpose.

If you thought that interest rates were going to rise in the next few months, how might this affect the advice that you give the Sampsons about investing in CDs with short-term versus long-term maturities?

The Sampsons—A Continuing Case: Chapter 6

""

The Sampsons have begun to invest in bank CDs to save for a down payment on a car and their children’s college education. But they are now concerned about potential repair expenses for Sharon’s car. They would like to have sufficient liquidity so that if they need to buy her a new car immediately, they could afford a down payment without being forced to cash in CDs early (because they would be charged a penalty). How might they revise their CD investing strategy to increase their liquidity?

Advise the Sampsons on money market investments they should consider to provide them with adequate liquidity.
