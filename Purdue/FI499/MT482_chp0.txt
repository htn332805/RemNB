A LOOK AT THIS CHAPTER 
We begin our analysis of financial statements by considering its relevance in the broader context of business analysis. We use Colgate Palmolive Co. as an example to help us illustrate the importance of assessing financial performance in light of industry and economic conditions. This leads us to focus on financial statement users, their information needs, and how financial statement analysis addresses those needs. We describe major types of business activities and how they are reflected in financial statements. A preliminary financial analysis illustrates these important concepts.

Something to Smile About?
Colgate has been creating smiles the world over for the past 200 years. However, the smiles are not limited to users of its immensely popular toothpaste. Colgate’s financial and stock price performance during the past decade has given plenty for its shareholders to smile about. Stock price appreciated 60% over this period, generating average returns for Colgate’s stockholders to the tune of about 7% per year, many times higher than that on the S&P 500 over a comparable period. Earnings have almost doubled during the past decade, which has witnessed the worst economic times since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
One of the world’s oldest corporations, Colgate today is a truly global company, with a presence in almost 200 countries and sales revenues of about $17 billion. Its brand name—most famously associated with its toothpaste—is one of the oldest and best recognized brands in the world. In fact, the brand has been so successful that “Colgate” has become a generic word for toothpaste in many countries, spawning imitations over which the company has been engaged in bitter legal disputes.
Colgate leverages the popularity of its brand as well as its international presence and implements a business strategy that focuses on attaining market leadership in certain key product categories and markets where its strengths lie. For example, Colgate controls almost a third of the world’s toothpaste market, where it has been gaining market share in the recent past! Such market leadership allows it pricing power in the viciously competitive consumer products markets. A total consumer orientation, constant innovation, and relentless quest for improving cost efficiencies have been Colgate’s hallmarks to success.
Another key feature in Colgate’s strategy has been its extremely generous dividend policy; over the past ten years Colgate has paid out almost $15 billion to its shareholders through cash dividends and stock buybacks, which is significantly more than the money it has raised from its shareholders in its entire history! Colgate’s dividend policy reflects its management philosophy of staying focused on generating superior shareholder returns rather than pursuing a strategy of misguided growth. Small, in Colgate’s case, has certainly been beautiful!

PREVIEW OF CHAPTER 1
Financial statement analysis is an integral and important part of the broader field of business analysis. Business analysis is the process of evaluating a company’s economic prospects and risks. This includes analyzing a company’s business environment, its strategies, and its financial position and performance. Business analysis is useful in a wide range of business decisions, such as whether to invest in equity or in debt securities, whether to extend credit through short- or long-term Page 4loans, how to value a business in an initial public offering (IPO), and how to evaluate restructurings including mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. Financial statement analysis is the application of analytical tools and techniques to general-purpose financial statements and related data to derive estimates and inferences useful in business analysis. Financial statement analysis reduces reliance on hunches, guesses, and intuition for business decisions. It decreases the uncertainty of business analysis. It does not lessen the need for expert judgment but, instead, provides a systematic and effective basis for business analysis. This chapter describes business analysis and the role of financial statement analysis. The chapter also introduces financial statements and explains how they reflect underlying business activities. We introduce several tools and techniques of financial statement analysis and apply them in a preliminary analysis of Colgate. We also show how business analysis helps us understand Colgate’s prospects and the role of business environment and strategy for financial statement analysis.


 BUSINESS ANALYSIS
This section explains business analysis, describes its practical applications, identifies separate analyses that make up business analysis, and shows how it all fits in with financial statement analysis.
Introduction to Business Analysis
Financial statement analysis is part of business analysis. Business analysis is the evaluation of a company’s prospects and risks for the purpose of making business decisions. These business decisions extend to equity and debt valuation, credit risk assessment, earnings predictions, audit testing, compensation negotiations, and countless other decisions. Business analysis aids in making informed decisions by helping structure the decision task through an evaluation of a company’s business environment, its strategies, and its financial position and performance.
To illustrate what business analysis entails we turn to Colgate. Much financial information about Colgate—including its financial statements, explanatory notes, and selected news about its past performance—is communicated in its annual report reproduced in Appendix A near the end of this book. The annual report also provides qualitative information about Colgate’s strategies and future plans, typically in the Management Discussion and Analysis, or MD&A, section.
An initial step in business analysis is to evaluate a company’s business environment and strategies. We begin by studying Colgate’s business activities and learn that it is a leading global consumer products company. Colgate has several internationally well-known brands that are primarily in the oral, personal, and home care markets. The company has brands in markets as varied as dental care, soaps and cosmetics, household cleaning products, and pet care and nutrition. The other remarkable feature of Colgate is its comprehensive global presence. Almost 80% of Colgate’s revenues are derived from international operations. The company operates in 200 countries around the world, with equal presence in every major continent! Exhibit 1.1 provides key financial details of Colgate’s operating divisions.
Colgate’s strengths are the popularity of its brands and the highly diversified nature of its operations. These strengths, together with the static nature of demand for consumer products, give rise to Colgate’s financial stability, thereby reducing risk for its equity and debt investors. For example, Colgate’s stock price weathered the bear market of 2008–2009, when the S&P 500 shed half its value (see Exhibit 1.2). The static nature of demand in the consumer products markets, however, is a double-edged
