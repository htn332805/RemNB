Solutions to Odd Problems
Chapter 1
1.1. The two basic sources of funds for all businesses are debt and equity.

1.3. A profitable firm is able to generate enough cash flows from productive assets to cover its operating expenses, taxes, and payments to creditors. Unprofitable firms fail to do this, and therefore, they may be forced to declare bankruptcy or close the business.

1.5. A firm should undertake a capital project only if the value of its future cash flows exceeds the cost of the project. For example, a financial manager would not invest $10,000,000 in a new production line if the net present value of future cash flows from that line are expected to be only $9,000,000. That would be like throwing $1,000,000 away.

1.7. The financial manager must make working capital decisions regarding the level of inventory to hold, the terms of granting credit (accounts receivable), and the firm’s policy on paying accounts payable.

1.9. Advantages: It is the easiest business organization to start and the least regulated; owners keep all the profits and do not have to share the decision-making authority with anyone; all income is taxed as personal income, which is usually in a lower tax bracket than corporate income. Disadvantages: The proprietor has unlimited liability for all business debt and financial obligations of the firm; the amount of capital that can be invested in the firm is limited by the proprietor’s wealth; it is difficult to transfer ownership (requires sale of the business).

1.11. The owners of a corporation are its stockholders or shareholders, and the evidence of their ownership is represented by shares of common stock. Other types of ownership do exist and include preferred stock.

1.13. Double taxation occurs when earnings are taxed twice. The owners of a C-corporation are subject to double taxation—first at the corporate level when the firm’s earnings are taxed and then again at a personal level when they receive dividends.

1.15. The board of directors of a corporation is responsible for serving the interests of stockholders in managing the corporation. It is possible that the interest of managers may deviate from those of the stockholders. The board’s objective is to monitor and correct any management decisions that might not be in the best interest of the stockholders. For example, board duties include hiring and firing the CEO, setting CEO pay, and monitoring the investment decisions of managers.

1.17. Drawbacks include: It is difficult to determine what is meant by “profit”; it does not address the size and timing of cash flows—it does not account for the time value of money; it ignores the uncertainty or risk of cash flows.

1.19. Both internal and external factors affect the stock price. They include the characteristics of the firm, the state of the economy, economic shocks, the business environment, expected cash flows (magnitude, timing, and risk), and current market conditions.

1.21. If the stock price falls below its maximum potential price, it attracts corporate raiders, who look for fundamentally sound but poorly managed companies that they can buy, turn around, and sell for a handsome profit.

1.23. A lack of business ethics can lead to corruption, which, in turn, creates inefficiencies in an economy, inhibits the growth of capital markets, and slows the rate of overall economic growth. For example, the Russian economy has had a relatively difficult time attracting foreign investment since the fall of the Soviet Union due, in part, to weak ethics and corruption in the business community and local and national governments. Lower foreign investment has led to slower overall economic growth than the country might otherwise have enjoyed.

1.25. Information asymmetry exists when one party to a business transaction possesses information that is not available to the other parties in the transaction. If the parties with less information understand their relative disadvantage, they are likely to pay lower prices for the goods and services they purchase or charge higher prices for the goods and services they sell.

Chapter 2
2.1. The role of the financial system is to gather money from households, businesses, and governments with surplus funds and channel these funds to those who need them. The financial system consists of financial markets and financial institutions.

2.3. Saver-lenders are those who have more money than they currently need. The principal saver-lenders in the economy are households. Borrower-spenders are those who need the money saver-lenders are offering. The main borrower-spenders in the economy are businesses, vbbnm, followed by the federal government, although households are important mortgage borrowers.

2.5. As the price of the security is lower than what you paid for it, it has a lower degree of liquidity to you, the owner. That is because the security cannot now be sold without a loss in value to the owner. Marketability refers to the ease with which a security can be sold or converted to cash. The information in the problem mentions that the security could be easily sold in secondary market, which implies it has high degree of marketability to you.

2.7. Trader Inc. is more likely to go public because of its larger size. Since the cost of SEC registration and compliance is very high, larger firms can offset these costs with the lower funding cost in public markets. Smaller companies find the cost prohibitive for the dollar amount of securities they sell.

2.13. Financial intermediaries allow smaller companies to access the financial markets. They do this by converting securities with one set of characteristics into securities with another set of characteristics that meets the needs of smaller companies. By repackaging securities, they are able to meet the needs of different clients.

2.15. Money markets are markets in which short-term debt instruments with maturities of less than one year are bought and sold. Capital markets are markets in which equity securities and debt instruments with maturities of more than one year are bought and sold.

2.17. Treasury bills and commercial paper.

2.19. The strong form of market efficiency states that all information is reflected in the security prices. In other words, there is no private or inside information that, if released, would potentially change the price. The semistrong form holds that all public information available to investors is reflected in the security’s price. Therefore, insiders with access to private information could potentially profit from trading on this knowledge before it becomes public. Finally, the weak form of market efficiency holds that there is both public and private information that is not reflected in the security’s price and having access to it can lead to abnormal profits.

2.21. Yes. The last sentence in the statement of Problem 2.20 suggests why this might happen. If, on the day of the announcement, some very bad news about the future prospects for Zippy became public, or if the market went down substantially, Zippy’s stock price might also have gone down despite the positive sales and earnings announcement. Zippy’s stock price may also go down if strong results were anticipated and this information was already reflected in the stock price, but the actual results were not as strong as anticipated. This is an example of the strong form of market efficiency.

2.23. Public markets are organized financial markets (also referred to as exchanges) where the public buys and sells securities through their stockbrokers. The SEC regulates public securities markets in the United States. In contrast, private markets involve direct transactions between two parties. These transactions lack SEC regulation.

2.25. The real rate of interest measures the return earned on savings, and it represents the cost of borrowing to finance capital goods. It is the interest rate in the absence of inflation. The real rate of interest is determined by the interaction between (1) firms that invest in capital projects and the rate of return they can expect to earn on investments in capital goods and (2) individuals’ time preference for consumption. Graphically, it is that point where the desired saving level equals the desired level of investment in the economy.

2.27. The Fisher equation reflects the expected, not the reported or actual, annualized change in commodity prices (∆Pe). It is used to protect buying power from changes in inflation, and it is incorporated into a loan contract by including the real interest rate that would exist in the absence of inflation.

2.29. Yes. The CD will be worth $1,067.50 at the end of the year and the price of the trip will be $1,066.

3.3. FIFO makes sense during times of rising prices because it allows the firm to eliminate the lower-priced inventory first, resulting in a higher profit margin. This allows the firm to leave higher-valued inventory on the balance sheet. During inflationary times, a firm using LIFO would see a lower profit margin and lower values of inventory on the balance sheet. It is important that anyone who is analyzing firms using different accounting methods on inventory recognizes the impact on the bottom line (profit margin and net income per the income statement) and on current assets reported on the balance sheet.

Other noncash expenses include deferred taxes and depletion charges, which are similar to depreciation and are used for natural resource assets. Gains and losses on disposals of assets also fit into this category, as they are reported on the income statement but do not involve cash inflows or outflows.

4.1. The quick ratio is a better or more conservative measure of liquidity than the current ratio. The difference in the measurement of the two is that for the quick ratio we exclude the inventory from short-term assets. Thus, the quick ratio is measured as:

This measure includes only the most liquid of the current assets and hence gives a better measure of liquidity.

We can see that Trademark is not doing as well as its competitors. The asset turnover ratio indicates that the firm needs to either increase its sales relative to its level of assets or reduce its assets relative to its level of sales. In addition, the lower quick ratio indicates a lower level of liquidity, perhaps because of too much inventory. A reduction in the inventory would help Trademark improve its performance to a level that is comparable to its peer group. In addition, collection of receivables is longer, which could result in cash flow problems and nonpayments.
Average industry ratios serve as benchmarks for the firm’s management to measure its own performance. While no two firms in any industry are identical, the average ratios across the industry are good target ratios for a firm.

Chapter 7
7.1. A holding period return is the total return over some investment period, or “holding” period. It consists of a capital appreciation component and an income component. A holding period return reflects past performance. The expected return is a weighted average of the possible returns from an investment, where each of these returns is weighted by the probability that it will occur. It describes a possible return (or even a return that may not be possible) for a yet-to-occur investment period.

7.9. Risk that cannot be diversified away is systematic risk. It is the only type of risk that exists in a diversified portfolio, and it is the only type of risk that is rewarded in asset markets.

7.11. Since the beta of any asset is the slope of the line of best fit for the plot of the asset against that of the market return, then we can use that logic to help us understand the beta of a T-bill. If we purchased a T-bill five years ago and held the same T-bill through each of the last 60 months, then the return for each of those 60 months would be exactly the same. Therefore, the vertical axis coordinates of each of the monthly returns would have the same value, and the slope (beta) of the line of best fit would be zero. A beta of zero means that our T-bill has no systematic risk. That is logical given that we know a T-bill has no risk at all, since it is a riskless asset.

7.13. The CAPM describes the relation between systematic risk and the expected return. The model tells us that the expected return on an asset with no systematic risk equals the risk-free rate. As systematic risk increases, the expected return increases linearly with beta. The CAPM is written as E(Ri) = Rrf + β i[E(Rm) – Rrf].

7.23. Your portfolio contains no unsystematic risk, but it does contain systematic risk. Therefore, the market should compensate you for the systematic risk that you bear. A risk-free security has no risk and therefore requires no compensation for risk bearing. The expected return of your portfolio should therefore be greater than the return of the risk-free security.

7.25. The statement is false. A portfolio of all assets would only eliminate unsystematic risk. The systematic risk would remain. If you could eliminate both systematic and unsystematic risk, the expected rate of return on the market portfolio would be equal to the risk-free rate of return, and we know that this is not true.

7.33. If all investors require returns that compensate them for the level of risk that they bear, then undiversified investors will require a greater return for a given investment than diversified investors will. In other words, diversified investors will be willing to pay a higher price for an asset than will undiversified investors. Therefore, a diversified investor is the marginal investor whose purchase will determine the price and, therefore, the expected return for an asset.

7.35. The Security Market Line (SML) shows the relationship between an asset’s expected return and its beta. We know the market has a beta of one, and we know the risk-free rate has a beta of zero. The risk-free rate of return is 7%, and the market is expected to return 5% more than this. Therefore, the expected rate of return for the market (a beta one asset) is 12%. To draw this SML, we need only connect the dots:


We can see from the following diagram that an asset with an expected return of 4% and a beta of –1.0 is underpriced (its expected return is too high). As the market becomes aware of this underpricing, investors will purchase the asset, bidding up its price until its expected return falls on the SML. (Recall that as the initial purchase price of an asset increases, the expected return from purchasing the asset will decrease because you are paying a higher initial cost for the asset.)


As we can see from the following diagram, an asset with a beta of 3.0 should have an expected return of 7% + (3)(5%) = 22%. The asset only has an expected return of 20%. Therefore, this asset is overpriced. Demand for this asset will be low, driving down its market price, until the asset’s expected return falls on the SML.

Using Equation 7.12, you can calculate the expected returns for the different shares:

The stock price would have to increase by approximately two standard deviations (2 × $5 = $10) for the price to increase to $25 and for conversion to become attractive to investors. From Chapter 7, we know that 95% of possible outcomes fall within two standard deviations of the mean (average) value in a normal distribution. This means that there is a 5% chance that the stock price will move up or down by $10 or more. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, this means that there is only a 2.5% chance that Zippy’s stock price will increase enough for it to become attractive for investors to exercise the conversion option in the next year.

9.1. A stock market index is used to measure the performance of the stock market. These indexes reflect the value of the stocks in a particular market, such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ, or across markets, and they increase and decrease as the values of the stocks go up and down. Examples of stock market indexes include the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the New York Stock Exchange Index, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and the NASDAQ Composite Index.

It is computed as the ratio of NPV plus initial investment divided by initial investment. In the capital rationing process, we can calculate the profitability index for each potential investment and choose the projects with the largest indexes until we run out of capital.

System 1 delivers a higher IRR because it requires a lower initial investment and the cost is recovered the first year. Thus, even with lower cash inflows in the years after startup, System 1 is able to deliver a higher return on the initial investment. System 2 has a higher initial investment but delivers a higher net cash flow for the firm.

Under the IRR decision criteria, since both projects have IRRs greater than the cost of capital, both will be accepted. Thus, there is no conflict between the NPV and IRR decisions.
Based on NPV, both projects will be accepted.
10.43. NPVX = $2,650.78; NPVY = $2,189.06; PIX = 1.1325; PIY = 1.1095. Both methods rank Project X over Project Y. Both should be accepted if they are independent and sufficient resources are available. If the projects are mutually exclusive, we should choose the project with the higher PI at r = 10%, which is Project X.

10.45.

IRR for Super Cutter = 17.97%; IRR for Duper Cutter = 14.76%. Since the cutters are mutually exclusive and the question advises us to use the IRR, we should choose the Super Cutter, since it has the higher rate of return (17.97%) as measured by IRR.
PISuperCutter = 1.244; PIDuperCutter = 1.143. The cutters are mutually exclusive, and the question advises us to use the PI, so we should choose the Super Cutter, since it has a higher profitability index (1.244 versus 1.143).
In this case, the profitability index method and the IRR do not give conflicting recommendations, so using both methods, the company would choose the Super Cutter. However, by computing the NPV, we see that the Duper Cutter will add $6,328.90 more value to the company than the Super Cutter. This happens because the scale of the Duper Cutter is much larger and as a result the value added as measured by NPV is higher. If resources were limited, we would choose by investing in the cutter that creates more value per dollar of investment, which is achieved by choosing the cutter with the higher profitability index, the Super Cutter. However, according to the question, there are no resource constraints, so I would advise the CFO not to use either IRR or PI for making his or her decision but instead choose to the Duper Cutter. Based on the NPV analysis, it would add more value to the company.
10.47. The correct answer is c; the discount payback period is 1.01 years longer than the payback period.

10.49. The correct answer is d; IRR = 28.79%.

Chapter 11
11.1. Accounting earnings can differ from cash flows for a number of reasons, making accounting earnings an unreliable measure of the costs and benefits of a project. For example, ease of manipulating earnings components such as accounts receivable and depreciation may result in distorted estimation of capital budgeting; using forecasted cash flows eliminates such possibilities. In addition, because of the time value of money, cash flows better reflect the actual available funds to be distributed to shareholders at any point in time.

11.3. There are two ways to adjust for depreciation: (1) subtract depreciation from EBITDA, multiply it by (1 – tax rate), and then add depreciation back; (2) add the tax shield from depreciation (depreciation multiplied by tax rate) to revenue. These two methods yield the same results. The assumption is that although depreciation itself is not a cash inflow or outflow, an increase in depreciation will result in a decrease in taxable income. This saving on tax is treated as a cash inflow in calculating incremental after-tax free cash flows.

11.5. The average tax rate is the total amount of tax divided by the total amount of money earned, while the marginal tax rate is the rate paid on the last dollar earned. In a progressive tax system, the marginal tax rate differs from the average tax rate. Since a firm already pays taxes, the appropriate tax rate used for the firm’s new project is the tax rate that the firm will pay on any additional profits that are earned because the project is adopted. Therefore, we use the marginal tax rate in calculating incremental after-tax cash flows.

11.7. Variable costs vary directly with unit sales, while fixed costs do not. Variable costs are those associated with purchasing the components for the product, the labor required, and sales and marketing. These costs vary according to the number of units produced. Fixed costs are those associated with assembly space and administrative expenses.

11.9. $9,436.80

11.11. $1,370

11.13. The equivalent annual cost (EAC) is the annualized cost of an investment stated in nominal dollars. In other words, it is the annual payment from an annuity with a life equal to that of a project that has the same NPV as the project. Since it is a measure of the annual cost or cash inflow from a project, the EAC for one project can be compared directly with the EAC from another project, regardless of the lives of those two projects.

11.15. You can effectively make the lives of the projects the same by assuming repeated investments over some identical period and compare the NPVs.

11.17. You should invest in bond A because it pays a higher nominal interest rate.

11.19. The relevant cash flow related to working capital at the beginning of the project is:

$10,000 + $30,000 + $25,000 – $5,000 = $60,000
The present value of relevant cash flow related to working capital at the end of the project is:

$60,000/(1 + 0.12)10 = $19,318.39
11.21. NPV = $795,165.59. Since NPV > 0, project should be accepted.

11.23. You should buy Model A because it has a lower EAC (−$2,866.47 vs. −$2,978.44).

11.25. Bell Mountain should purchase the system in year 3.

11.39. The correct answer is d, $231,371

11.41. The correct answer is d, neither the NPV calculation nor the IRR calculation.

Chapter 12
12.1. Fixed costs are costs that in the short term cannot be changed regardless of how much output the project produces. One example is the in-home technical computer support business (discussed in Learning by Doing Application 12.1). Regardless of the number of house calls the technical support firm makes, it will incur the full cost of advertising. Variable costs are costs that depend on the number of units of output produced by the project. An example is the gas that the technical support firm uses to make house calls. The cost to keep the vehicles gassed up is directly related to the number of service calls the firm makes.

12.3. Yes. EBIT is $375,000 with the new technology and $250,000 with the old. Since the EBIT after the technology change is $125,000 higher, the firm should adopt the new production technology.

12.5. 1.392

12.7. The degree of accounting operating leverage gives us the ratio with which the firm can convert revenues into EBIT. That is, if the firm’s operating leverage is 3, then a 15% increase will convert to a 45% (15% × 3) increase in EBIT for the firm.

12.9. Per-unit contribution is critical to break-even analysis to enable a firm to determine how many units must be sold to cover the firm’s fixed costs.

12.11. The accounting operating break-even point tells us the number of units that must be sold each year during the life of a project in order for the project to break even with regard to its opportunity cost of capital. Because the accounting operating break-even point calculation accounts for all cash flows over the life of a project, it enables us to compute the annual level of unit sales that will result in an NPV of $0. This is, by definition, the break-even point with regard to a project’s opportunity cost of capital.

12.13. Since depreciation and amortization are noncash items, the manufacturing firm would have the greatest discrepancy between FCF and EBIT.

12.15. Specialty should produce and sell the bulbs because EBIT for the additional bulbs is positive (EBIT = $1,000).

12.17. 15.9%

12.19. 340,000 candles

12.21. While the business may show an accounting loss, our focus should be on the cash flow gain or loss. A project can produce an accounting loss but cash flow income because the depreciation and amortization charges do not apply to the cash flow calculations, as they are noncash expenses that help to reduce the tax liability. Therefore, the project is viable if it does not show a cash flow loss.

12.23. $3,672

12.25. Sensitivity analysis captures the effect of a change in a single item, such as unit selling price, or a change in the number of units sold on a specific item, such as EBIT. However, it is unlikely that a change in the selling price of an item will not affect the demand, and consequently the number of units sold, for the product in question. Scenario analysis analyzes multiple effects on an item such as EBIT by changing several interrelated variables at the same time to measure the effect of an entire scenario change. Therefore, scenario analysis is a much more practical tool for stress-testing a project.

12.27. By increasing the price of a bottle by 10%, the FCF increases by $8,400 from $38,000 to $46,400.

12.29. 1.67

12.31. A 10% increase in revenue will drive a 20% increase in EBITDA.

12.33. The firm with the higher fixed cost should have a lower variable cost per unit, assuming that there is a trade-off. A lower variable cost per unit would then increase the contribution margin for that firm.

12.35. Based on the expected values, the NPV of the project is −$52,649, so it should be accepted.

12.37. 3,992 cars

12.39. The correct answer is c. If the Fulcrum Company increases production and sales by 5%, its operating earnings are expected to increase by 20%.

13.3. When we calculate the cost of debt for a U.S. firm, we must take into account the tax subsidy given in the United States for interest payments on debt. For every dollar the firm pays in interest, the firm’s tax bill will decline by ($1 × t), where t is the firm’s marginal tax rate. We adjust for this tax benefit by multiplying the pretax cost of debt by (1 − t). This calculation gives us the after-tax cost of debt. We use the after-tax cost of debt for cost of capital calculations such as calculating the WACC.

13.13. The value of the firm’s assets is equal to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. The cash flow claim on the assets is prioritized by the financing of the assets. Therefore, the financing claims on the assets of the firm fully account for the entire value of the assets, and the value of the financing claims must equal the value of the assets that are carved up by those claims.

It is easy to see that in order to solve for a cost of capital, kcs, you must have a good idea of what g1 and g2 are. If those growth rates are poor estimates, then the calculation for kcs will also be a poor estimate.

13.23. Markets adjust the cost of capital according to the level of systematic risk in a project. Therefore, the project with the greatest level of systematic risk will have the greatest positive impact on the cost of capital for the firm, even if it has the lowest level of unsystematic risk.

13.25. Since Imaginary will be financing the project with the same mix of capital that it is currently utilizing for its projects, we will have met the first restriction concerning financing mix. In addition, the new project will have the same degree of systematic risk (in addition to involving the same general line of business). Therefore, Imaginary can use the 9.26% cost of capital to evaluate its project.

13.27. While the growth in dividends has been extremely constant for Macroswift over the last 15 years, it is appropriate to assume a constant-growth rate only if that same rate will continue in the future. Two factors will act to alter that growth in the future. MacroSwift will have competition for its current product list in the near future, and that could alter the firm’s growth rate. In addition, the firm is expanding its product line into an area that will probably not yield the same level of growth. It is therefore unlikely that MacroSwift’s dividend growth rate will continue at a 3% annual rate. This suggests that we should consider something other than constant growth in our modeling.

13.29. 12.35%

13.31. 9.78%

13.33. Market returns play a role in market prices. If those prices are ignored, then the benefits from the efficiency of the market’s information process are essentially thrown away. Since the market adjusts securities prices according to the expected return for investing in a security, then ignoring that information is the same as ignoring what the market deems to be an appropriate cost of capital for the firm. The theory underlying the discounting process requires that the cost of the different types of financing be weighted by their relative market values.

13.35. Since, collectively, the debt and equity holders are entitled to receive all of the cash flows that the assets of the firm are expected to produce, the systematic risk of the cash flows that they are entitled to receive must be the same as the systematic risk of the cash flows the assets are expected to produce.

14.1. Wolfgang’s cash conversion cycle is 69 days. Since this is less than the industry average of 75 days, the firm is more efficient than the average firm in the industry in managing its working capital.

14.3. This firm has a negative cash conversion cycle of −3 days. The amount of time to manage its inventory and the time taken to collect its receivables is less than the time taken to pay its suppliers.

14.5. 73 days

14.7. The risk of a restrictive current asset management strategy comes from exposure to shortage costs, which can be either financial or operating costs. Financial costs are associated with a sudden and unforeseen loss of liquidity that makes it difficult for a firm to repay its current liabilities. In this condition, firms may be forced to rely on costly external emergency borrowing. If such funds can’t be secured, firms may have to default on their loan obligations. Operating shortage costs result from lost production or sales that occur if a firm does not have sufficient raw materials or finished goods. Operating shortage costs may also occur if a firm’s credit policies are too restrictive and deter a significant number of sales to potential customers.

Chapter 15
15.1. Every business plan should contain the following information: (1) a description of the business and industry trends, (2) vision and key strategies for the business, (3) principal products or services and any innovative features or patents, (4) the management team and their experience, (5) market analysis and sales forecast, (6) how the products will be marketed and sold, (7) production costs such as materials and labor, (8) facilities needed and estimated costs, (9) capital required and the use of the proceeds, and (10) detailed budget with six years of projected financial statements.

15.3. A firm can choose to either sell the business at some period, take it public, or in some instances remain a private company with few shareholders.

15.5. In order to determine the price of a new security, the investment banker can look at comparable companies and see what they are trading for. Another approach is performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which is just like determining the price of a stock. You forecast future cash flows of the company, usually for a time horizon of 5 to 10 years, and discount them back to the present in order to get the firm value. The discount rate will be a factor in both the cost of debt and the cost of equity (WACC).

15.7. Debt issues that are complex in nature and/or issued at times of uncertainty tend to be brought to the market by negotiated sales. This approach allows the underwriter to better control the uncertain situation and better explains the firm to potential investors, thereby leading to lower issue costs.

15.9. $24,308,528

15.11. The steps in a general cash offering are (1) type of security and amount to be raised, (2) approvals, (3) registration statement, (4) offer price, and (5) closing.

15.13. The economies of scale in issuing securities means that as the size of the issue increases, the total issue cost, as a percentage of the amount raised, declines. High fixed costs are spread out over a larger sum.

15.15. A public offering allows for higher security, since SEC is involved; it offers more liquidity, which might be important for a large issue; and it usually leads to a higher yield. Private placement, on the other hand, offers faster speed to market, lower issuance cost, and ease of restructuring. Given the size of the Nalco Holdings, the company would be better off choosing to raise debt in the public market.

15.17. The borrowing cost will increase to 9.43%.

15.19. You can fund the project in stages. This will allow you to review the project’s profitability before you commit to further financing. You can also require the entrepreneurs to invest some of their own capital in the new start-up, which will tie them to the project and make it harder for them to simply abandon the idea.

Chapter 16
16.1. The inability of individual investors to borrow and lend at the same rate as firms, which goes against the assumption that there are no information or transactions costs, is analogous to the dull knife. Since the process of rearranging the claims on the firm’s assets is similar to carving up the firm into different pieces, it is easy to see that the market friction produced by the disparity between individual investors and firms is similar to the effect of the dull knife in our pie example.

16.3. Under Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition 1, the value of the firm is independent of the proportion of debt and equity it utilizes.

16.15. The assumption that there are no information or transaction costs means, for example, that individuals can borrow and lend at the same rate as firms. If an investor could not sell (or buy) shares by investing (or borrowing) without transaction costs, then some of the value conserved in the Modigliani and Miller arguments through personal trading would be dissipated by transaction costs. This dissipation would then negate the conservation of value proposed by M&M.

16.17. $530,000,000

16.19. If the employees of a firm understand that the firm has a significant chance of filing for bankruptcy, then costs to the firm could be manifested in a number of ways, including:

Lower productivity due to lower morale and job hunting. This could be as simple as employees spending time gossiping about what is going to happen to them as well as employees actively pursuing other jobs while on the payroll of the troubled firm.
Higher recruiting costs. Understanding that working for the firm is a risky venture, new employees will seek compensation for this additional risk. Therefore, recruiting employees will become more expensive due to greater recruiting efforts as well as greater compensation expense when a new employee is finally located and hired.
16.21. Managers expect to lose their jobs in one year whether they work hard or not and take the project or not. Although there may be a slim chance that the firm will not declare bankruptcy, management has no incentive to take on the difficult project. This makes the shortage to the debt holders, as well as the stockholders, greater than it would be if the firm followed the rule of always accepting positive NPV projects. This is another example of agency costs that can arise from financial distress.

16.23. If we hold all other things equal, then the tax shield would become more valuable in the scenarios with positive debt amounts. While we cannot say for certain, given the information in the question, an increase in the tax rate will increase the value of the tax shield and should increase the amount of debt in the optimal capital structure. Therefore, it would appear that an increase in the tax rate should motivate firms to increase their debt levels.

16.25. The internally generated equity is utilized first as a source of financing, but it does not mean that the internally generated funds are cheaper than debt. Internally generated funds belong to stockholders and, therefore, are really equity financing, which is riskier and more expensive than debt. However, using internally generated funds enables the firm to avoid the costs associated with borrowing or selling stock (including the costs associated with the signals that financing announcements send investors), which, in turn, can make internal funds most attractive.

16.27. In the absence of information or transaction costs and any effect of debt on the real investment policy of the firm, the value of the firm is increasing in proportion to debt in the firm’s capital structure, due to the present value of the tax shield on the debt. Therefore, although operating without debt may be a safer play for investors, it does not maximize stockholder value, which should be the goal of managers.

16.29. $810,000,000

16.31. The root of the problem is that the firm’s management is too comfortable, because the weekly trip to Cancun is not costly enough to the managers of the firm. PolyAna could drastically increase the proportion of debt in the firm’s capital structure. This would decrease the amount of “free” cash that PolyAna’s managers could spend on their weekly outings. If enough debt is placed on this firm, then a cash shortage, or lack of a large cash surplus, would necessitate that the managers work on new positive NPV projects rather than spend their Fridays in Cancun.

16.33. $3,250,000; $2,250,000; kcs and WACC before restructuring both equal 10%; after restructuring, kcs = 11.33% and WACC = 9.23%

16.35. The correct answer is a, new debt is preferable to new equity.

Chapter 17
17.1. Since dividends convey information concerning the future prospects of the firm, any change in dividend levels is also believed to convey a change in management’s forecast of the firm’s prospects. That is, lowering the dividend from $0.25 to $0.20 suggests that the firm’s future cash flow may be reduced. This reduction could be because of a generally reduced level of profitability, because the firm’s projects are winding down, or even because of an increased need to invest in new positive NPV projects for the future.

17.3. The proper chronological order is: (1) declaration date: the day the dividend payment was announced, (2) ex-dividend date: the first day you can buy shares and not receive the dividend, (3) record date: the day shareholders of record receive the dividend when it is paid, and (4) payment date: the date when the dividend is actually paid.

17.5. We have to remember that any cash paid to shareholders reduces the amount that is available to bondholders in the event of bankruptcy. Because bondholders are aware of this potential problem, they should then restrict the amount of cash that can be paid to shareholders to at least a level where bondholders will still be able to generate their expected rate of return.

17.7. $9.75

17.9. A share repurchase, if followed through by management, will place the same amount of cash in the hands of its shareholders. However, since shareholders have the option of selling their shares or holding their shares, the repurchase leaves it up to the individual shareholders whether or not they would like to receive the cash. The dividend payment method will effectively force the shareholders to receive the cash.

17.11. The no-transaction-costs assumption is required for investors to create their own homemade dividends or for investors to “undo” their unwanted dividend payments by purchasing additional shares of the company stock. Therefore, by relaxing the no-transaction-costs assumption, we would increase the cost of producing the homemade dividend or the cost of undoing the unwanted dividends, which would then make dividend policy a relevant factor in valuing shares. For instance, receiving an unwanted dividend would now make it more costly to convert that dividend into new shares, since part of that dividend would be dissipated to transaction costs. In that situation, the investor would value a non-dividend-paying share higher than a dividend-paying share.

17.13. The value of a dividend received, after taxes are included, will be less than before. Therefore, we would expect the value of dividend-paying stocks to decrease relative to non-dividend-paying stocks.

17.15. When a firm reduces its dividend, the firm is telling the market that it does not have sufficient cash, which is of course a bad or negative signal. However, by increasing the dividend, the firm is telling its investors that it has more cash than it has investment uses for that cash. If the firm is currently viewed as a growth firm, then the market could interpret an increase in the dividend as a slowdown in the growth rate of the firm precipitated by the firm’s lower investment rate.

17.17. You would prefer that the firm initiate a share repurchase. You can opt not to sell your shares to the firm but still participate in the increased value of the firm’s shares, since your pro-rata share of the expected future cash flows generated by the firm will increase. You would not like a dividend payment, since you would then be required to receive the cash if you owned the shares at the time of the record date.

17.19. To understand this argument, we have to consider two points. First, the firm should be managed for the benefit of its shareholders. Second, the firm is the ultimate insider concerning the value of its shares. Given the above points, we must realize that any time the firm is purchasing its shares, it must be doing so because the firm’s management believes that the firm’s shares are undervalued. Therefore, by purchasing its shares, the firm is utilizing its inside information to purchase shares and ultimately to take advantage of the current owner of those shares in order to benefit the remaining shareholders of the firm. It is then not doing something in the interest of all of its shareholders since those who sell will be selling at a price lower than what they could have realized had they held their shares until the repurchase was complete.

17.21. (1) Open-market purchase—the firm simply purchases the shares in the market; (2) tender offer—the firm makes an offer through a general announcement, offering to buy up to a certain number of shares from anyone who wishes to sell (either the fixed-price or Dutch auction method can be used for a tender offer) (3) targeted share repurchases—the firm directly negotiates with an individual shareholder to buy shares from that individual.

17.23. The purpose of setting the number of days between the ex-dividend date and the record date is to allow for a sale of securities to clear in order to determine which “owner” is entitled to the dividend. Since the settlement period was reduced from five days to two days, we should have seen the number of days between the ex-dividend date and the record date to be reduced from four days to two.

17.25. If the firm has been successful over the last 10 years, then the value of its equity has increased but the total value of its debt has not increased accordingly. Therefore, the debt-to-equity ratio of the firm has been dropping. As a result of paying a dividend, the value of the equity, after the dividend is paid, will drop relative to that of the debt. This will help the firm to balance its debt-equity ratio and get closer to a 50%–50% percent mix (assume that the debt was below the 50% level to begin with).

17.31. $150,000

17.33. You can do this by paying out some of the cash that the firm has accumulated using either a special dividend or a stock repurchase. A special dividend can be completed quickly, but would subject your stockholders to taxes if they are not tax-exempt organizations or stockholders who wanted to retain the same dollar investment in your firm.

Chapter 18
18.1. The closer the type of organization is to the end of the list above, the better is its access to capital. Sole proprietorships must rely on equity contribution from the proprietor and debt or lease financing. In contrast, partnerships can turn to all of the partners for additional capital, and corporations can sell shares to both insiders and outsiders. Limited partnerships and limited liability companies (LLCs) are less constrained than general partnerships because they can raise money from limited partners or “members,” as outside investors in LLCs are called, who are not directly involved in running the business. C-corporations can have a virtually unlimited number of stockholders.

The forms of organizations discussed in this chapter include: sole proprietorship, partnership (general partnership and limited partnership), limited liability company (LLC), and corporations (S-corporation and C-corporation).

18.3. Sole proprietorships, general partnerships, and limited partnerships all are at a disadvantage. Sole proprietors and general partnerships face the possibility that their personal assets can be taken from them to satisfy claims against their businesses. In contrast, the liabilities of investors in limited partnerships, LLCs, and corporations are limited to the money that they have invested in the business.

18.5. You can try to raise additional equity financing from your friends and family, from venture capitalists, or from other potential investors that you know. Debt financing might be obtained through bank loans, cash advances on credit cards, or loans from other local individual investors or other businesses. Of course, if a company is large enough, equity and debt financing can be obtained in the public markets.

18.7. The replacement cost is the cost of duplicating the assets of a business in their present form, consisting of tangible and intangible assets as of the valuation date.

18.9. Excess cash is a nonoperating asset because, by definition, this cash can be distributed to stockholders without affecting the operations of the business and, therefore, the value of the expected future cash flows. It makes sense to add back the value of excess cash because it represents value over and above that which the business is expected to produce.

18.11. Shareholders in a private company may have to spend considerable resources in money and time to sell their shares. This additional transaction cost will make value derived from a similar publicly traded company an overestimated figure. Therefore, you will most likely not be willing to pay $12 a share. You can apply an appropriate marketability discount to this price as a fair price for this private equity.

18.13. An LLC is a hybrid of a limited partnership and a corporation. Like a corporation, an LLC provides limited liability for the people who make the business decisions in the firm while enabling all investors to retain the tax advantages of a limited partnership.

18.15. The break-even point for TV advertisement = 1,250 units. The break-even point for flyers = 150 units. Therefore, you should choose the flyer option.

18.17. $1,573.64 million

18.19. While the value estimates in the previous questions are reasonably similar, the enterprise value/EBITDA multiple is more appropriate for this analysis. The reason is that the capital structures of Johnson and Billy’s differ considerably, and the enterprise value/EBITDA multiple is less sensitive to differences in leverage.

18.21. $12,675,000

18.23. With $75,000 of capital invested in the initial period, the company will have negative cash balances during each of the first three months and positive cash balances in the following months. Additional capital investment totaling $9,400 will be needed to avoid negative cash balances in month 2. In other words, you will have to invest $84,400 of capital in total at the beginning of the business just to avoid negative cash balances. To maintain a minimum cash balance of $5,000, you will need to make an initial capital investment of $89,400 ($84,400 + $5,000).

The monthly break-even points for the firm are: 4,333.3 bottles in the initial month and 1,833.3 bottles in the following months.

18.25. See the key elements of a business plan in Section 18.2.

18.27. As discussed in the chapter, it is very difficult to value such a young firm with so many uncertainties. The company has a short history, high investments, no sales, and highly uncertain cash flows in the future. The cost approach is not valid for this company. It is hard to value the company using multiples analysis because of the lack of sales and negativity of earnings, and because of lack of comparable companies in the same business. The transaction analysis approach is also hard to apply.

Despite the many uncertainties, we should try to estimate the future cash flows and the risks associated with these cash flows. First of all, we need to estimate the probability and time length to achieve success in developing the product. In addition, we need to find out what happens in case the firm’s capital is used up before the product is developed. We need to decide whether, based on the company’s future prospects, it is possible to raise additional external capital at that point of time, and if not, we need to decide whether the business has any liquidation value. Then, we need to estimate the market demand and shares as well as target price of the product, in case it is developed successfully. We also need to estimate the short-term and long-term growth rate of the company based on market, industry, and firm-specific conditions.

Chapter 19
19.1. The strategic plan is the blueprint for a company’s management that determines the firm’s long-term goals, identifies the strategies to achieve these goals, and determines the company’s ability to be competitive. It drives all decision making within the firm and covers all areas of a firm’s operations.

19.3. First, the financing plan identifies the amount of external financing needed and where the funds could be obtained. Second, the plan identifies the firm’s target capital structure. Last, the plan identifies the firm’s dividend policy, which directly affects the amount of funds available for new investment projects. The more funds the firm pays out as cash dividends, the more external funding it needs for its investments.

19.5. The important elements of financial modeling are the sales forecast, economic assumptions, pro forma statements, investment decisions, financing requirements, and the “plug factor” that determines the source of the external funds needed.

19.7. $52,686; 55%

19.9. Net sales $1,710; costs $399; net income $1,311

19.11. The capital intensity ratio measures the amount of assets needed to generate one dollar in sales. The higher the ratio, the more assets needed to generate every dollar of sales and, hence, the more capital intensive the firm. The reverse is also true.

Chapter 20
20.1. An option is the right to buy or sell an asset at a pre-specified price on or before a pre-specified date.

20.3. $0; $15

20.5. The value of a call option increases as: (1) current value of the underlying asset increases; (2) exercise price decreases; (3) volatility of the value of the underlying asset increases; (4) time until the expiration of the option increases; or (5) risk-free rate of interest increases.

20.7. The seller of an option hopes the option will not be exercised. In this case, the option will be exercised if the asset value at expiration is lower than the strike price, so the seller hopes the asset value will rise (or at least will remain above the strike price).

20.9. No. The seller of a call option can lose a theoretically unlimited amount of money because the value of the underlying asset can go arbitrarily high. The seller of a put option is limited to losing the amount of the strike price (since that is how much the seller would lose if the stock price went to zero).

20.11. Your option is worth very slightly more than zero. There is little chance that the stock price will move above $100 by tomorrow, but the chance is not zero, so the option still has some value.

20.13. The underlying asset of a financial option is a financial asset, while the underlying asset of a real option is a real asset like an investment project.

20.15. Agency costs arise because the incentives of shareholders are different from those of the debt holders. Equity and debt claims are like different types of options on the firm. The payoff function for the stockholders looks exactly like that for the owner of a call option, where the exercise price is the amount owed on the loan and the underlying asset is the firm itself. The payoff function for the lenders looks like that for the seller of a put option, where the exercise price is the amount of the loan and the underlying asset is the firm itself. The different payoff functions create different incentives for shareholders and debt holders. For example, shareholders are likely to pursue more risky projects. The increased volatility of cash flows increases the expected payout for the holder of a call option, the shareholder, and decreases the expected payout for the seller of a put option, the debt holder.

20.17. The purchaser of a callable bond is simultaneously selling the issuer a call option on that bond. The value is equal to the value of the straight bond minus the value of the option. This is clearly less than the value of the (noncallable) bond by itself.

20.19. Option writers receive the value of the option up front. The money the seller receives by selling the bond is referred to as the bond premium. This payment compensates them for the obligation they are taking on.

20.21. $7.01

20.23. $1.18

20.25. Managers have incentives to avoid bankruptcy or even underperformance because the personal cost to them is quite high. As a result, they may choose to avoid high-risk investments even if those investments have highly positive NPVs. The costs to the manager if the project goes badly outweigh the benefits if it goes well. However, stockholders want the manager to take positive-NPV projects, even if they are risky. Golden parachutes help to solve this problem by reducing the costs to the manager associated with poor performance or bankruptcy. The manager faces a payoff structure like that faced by the seller of an option. Golden parachutes serve to reduce the volatility of that option and therefore to reduce the value of the option.

20.27. The payoff of these two portfolios is identical.

20.29.

Both the debt and the equity are worth $5 million.
$6.5 million
$3.5 million
20.31. Call option 1 has a lower strike price and costs less. In a situation like this, you can earn an arbitrage opportunity by purchasing the less expensive option (#1) and selling the more expensive (#2).

20.33. It mitigates this concern because the lenders will benefit through the call option from increased volatility in the value of the firm. How much a conversion option mitigates this concern depends on the specific characteristics of the option.

Appendix C
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: Implications for Cash Flow to Investors, the Cost of Capital, and Capital Structure

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Describe the major federal tax law changes adopted under H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in 2017 and explain how these changes affect cash flow from operating activity and cash flow to investors.
Discuss and compute the impact of the 2017 federal tax law changes on the after-tax cost of debt and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a firm.
Explain how tax law changes can alter firm value and a firm’s capital structure decisions.
On the morning of December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed H.R. 1 into law, a tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill, which became effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, enacted sweeping changes in U.S. federal corporate tax policies and rates. In signing the legislation, President Trump described the tax bill as the “biggest reform of all time.”

At the time the legislation was signed, many companies declined to publicly comment on how the federal tax law changes would alter their businesses or stated that they were still trying to assess the overall effects of the various changes on their operations. Others, including FedEx Corporation, touted the bill as providing an incentive to modify the timing of their capital expenditures. Several companies, such as Coca-Cola and Chevron, also noted the important impact of lower corporate tax rates on their ability to compete with firms headquartered outside of the United States and increase their payouts to investors. While a number of the elements of the 2017 tax bill have received both criticism and praise, the modifications it brought to federal tax law have undoubtedly had an impact on a variety of decisions made by financial managers and the cash flow to their investors.

Appendix C Preview
This appendix to the 5th edition of Fundamentals of Corporate Finance uses the changes instituted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to review the role of taxes in determining the cash flows from operating activity and to investors, the cost of debt, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and, ultimately, a firm’s capital structure and financing choices.

For a profitable company, cash outflows to pay taxes are one of its most significant expenses, reducing cash flow from operating activity and, by extension, cash flow to investors. Corporations pay taxes to the municipalities in which they do business, including state and local governments, as well as the federal government. Federal tax policies are important for businesses, as they typically carry the highest statutory tax rate of any jurisdiction and allow pretax expensing of depreciation charges and interest payments. Because of this importance, changes in federal tax laws and statutory rates, such as those associated with the 2017 federal tax law, can have a significant impact on corporate policies and the cash flow to investors. We frame our discussion in the context of the 2017 legislation, which brought about the most dramatic changes in corporate tax rates in decades. It should also be noted, however, that the discussion here can be expanded to address the impact of any change in tax laws on corporate cash flows, the cost of capital, and capital structure. This is particularly important given recent discussions of additional corporate tax reforms by the Biden administration.

We begin our discussion of the impact of the 2017 federal tax law by analyzing how the replacement of progressive corporate income tax brackets with a flat 21 percent corporate tax rate affects cash flow to investors. We then extend our discussion to include two of the most important changes in the tax law, specifically (1) an expanded accelerated depreciation policy commonly referred to as “bonus depreciation” and (2) new limits to the deductibility of net business interest when computing pretax income. Next, we explain how the policy changes in the tax bill lowered the value of the interest tax shield and increased the cost of debt capital and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of levered firms. Finally, we examine how all these changes affect corporate financial policies and the value of the firm.

C.1 Corporate Taxes and Cash Flow to Investors
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Describe the major federal tax law changes adopted under H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in 2017 and explain how these changes affect cash flow from operating activity and cash flow to investors.
The adoption of H.R. 1 in December 2017 introduced sweeping changes in corporate tax rates and rules starting in the 2018 fiscal tax year. We focus on three changes in the tax laws that have an important impact on the cash flow from operating activity and to investors. These changes include the elimination of the progressive corporate tax rates used in prior tax years, as well as changes in the tax rules covering pretax expensing of depreciation and the deductibility of interest payments.

Corporate Tax Rates and Cash Flow to Investors
The most significant change associated with the 2017 federal tax legislation was the elimination of the progressive corporate income tax rates summarized in Exhibit C.1. As you can see, the marginal tax rate varied from 15 percent to 35 percent (column 3) on income earned by a company in 2017. In general, under this progressive tax system, companies with lower taxable incomes paid lower tax rates than larger companies with higher taxable incomes. Historically, this gave preferential treatment to small businesses and start-up companies as a means of stimulating new business formation.

EXHIBIT C.1 U.S. Federal Corporate Income Tax Rates for 2017

The federal corporate marginal tax rate varies from 15 to 35 percent. Generally speaking, smaller companies with lower taxable income have lower tax rates than larger companies with higher taxable incomes. Smaller businesses are given preferential treatment to encourage new business formation.

(1)	 	(2)	 	(3)	 	(4)
Corporations’ Taxable Income	Pay This Amount on the Base of the Bracket	Marginal Tax Rate: Tax Rate on the Excess Over the Base	Average Tax Rate at Top of Bracket
$0–$50,000	 	$0	 	15%	 	15.0%
50,001–75,000	  7,500	25	18.3
75,001–10,000,000	13,750	34	33.9
More than 10,000,000	22,250	35	33.9
Under the new law, these income-based tax brackets have been replaced by a single “flat” corporate rate of 21 percent, which applies to taxable income earned beginning in 2018. The 21 percent tax rate is applied to every dollar of taxable income; thus, both the marginal and the average corporate federal rates will be a constant 21 percent. It is important to note that since many local and state taxes are still determined using progressive tax rates, corporate income will continue to be subject to varying “blended” marginal tax rates that are determined by the combined application of federal, state, and local tax rates.

To see the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on a firm’s cash flows, let’s compute the 2017 tax bill for a corporation with taxable income of $150,000. This tax calculation involves three distinct rate brackets shown in Exhibit C.1, and the firm has a total tax bill of $39,250. The average tax rate is 26.2 percent ($39,250/$150,000 = 0.262, or 26.2 percent) and the firm’s marginal tax rate, which is the rate paid on the last dollar earned, is 35 percent.

How does this 2017 tax bill compare with the tax bill for a company that has an identical taxable income of $150,000 in 2018 and is subject to the new 21 percent constant tax rate? With the new rate, the firm’s total tax bill is computed as 0.21 × $150,000 = $31,500, and both the corresponding average and marginal tax rates are $31,500/$150,000 = 0.21, or 21 percent. Note that the 2018 tax bill is $7,750 lower than the 2017 tax bill.

A change in federal tax rates can have an important impact on the cash flows to investors. In the marginal rates outlined in Exhibit C.1, note that the lowest marginal rate applied in the past was 15 percent, which is lower than the new flat rate of 21 percent. This suggests that, all else equal, firms in the lowest bracket of taxable income have faced a higher tax bill and a lower cash flow from operating activity since 2018. Beyond the first $50,000 of taxable income, however, firms pay a lower marginal tax rate for each additional dollar of taxable income under the new flat rate. Under the progressive tax system that was in place during 2017, a firm with taxable earnings of $90,384 paid an average tax rate of exactly 21 percent.1 Firms with taxable earnings above (below) this amount now have lower (higher) federal tax bills with the application of the 21 percent flat rate. Since the average (median) U.S. public company reported taxable income of $629.12 million ($64.06 million) in the 2017 fiscal year, implementation of the flat 21 percent rate lowered taxes and increased the cash flow to investors for most U.S. public companies.

Learning by Doing Application C.1 presents another example of how the implementation of a 21 percent flat corporate tax rate can affect the corporate tax bill for a firm.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION C.1
Calculating Tax Rates

Problem

The chief financial officer of Balsa Chemicals Inc. forecasts that the company’s taxable income in the next fiscal year will be $96,980. Estimate the expected federal tax bill for the company in the next fiscal year applying a flat 21 percent corporate rate. How does this figure compare to the federal tax bill Balsa would have paid on the same level of taxable income in 2017? What is the company’s marginal tax rate under the two different tax regimes?





Bonus Depreciation and the Cash Flow to Investors
As discussed in Chapter 11, depreciation expenses are commonly estimated using a straight-line depreciation schedule for financial reporting and the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) for tax purposes. While these methods allow for the same amount of cumulative depreciation over the life of an asset, using accelerated depreciation for tax purposes allows for greater depreciation expensing early in the life of an asset, which increases the present value of the depreciation tax shield.

While depreciation itself is a noncash expense, it has an important impact on a firm’s cash flow from operating activity (CFOA) because it reduces a firm’s current taxable income. In Chapter 3, we saw that CFOA can be written as Equation 3.4:

Cash flow to investors (CFI) is equal to CFOA minus cash flow invested in net working capital (CFNWC) and long-term assets (CFLTA):

Thus, the impact of depreciation on CFOA directly affects CFI.

For most businesses, the largest noncash expenses are depreciation and amortization of long-term assets. Recall that we add back noncash expenses in the calculation of CFOA because no cash is actually being paid out when the firm accounts for the expense on the income statement. For example, a depreciation charge does not reflect a cash outflow in the current period; the cash outflow actually took place when the asset was purchased.

In addition to modifying corporate tax rates, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act implemented a number of changes that affect the recognition of pretax expenses. One of the most important changes was the expansion of the “bonus depreciation” policy, which allows for a significant first-year depreciation deduction for qualified assets. Under the 2017 Act, firms are allowed to recognize 100 percent of the depreciation expense for an asset in the first year of its use, doubling the 50 percent bonus depreciation that was previously allowed by the tax law. This expansion of bonus depreciation will only be in full effect through 2022, as it is scheduled to decline over time for assets acquired in 2023 and beyond.

Bonus depreciation has a positive impact on CFOA for firms that are investing in long-term assets. With 100 percent depreciation, firms are able to fully deduct the cost of a fixed asset in the year of the investment and thus do not have to defer any of the tax benefits of depreciation to later years. Given the time value of money, the positive cash flow implications of bonus depreciation can be substantial for firms, particularly for those with many assets whose depreciable lives extend over a long period of time.

To see the magnitude of the cash flow effects of accelerated depreciation, let’s consider an example. Assume that in 2021 Diaz Manufacturing (from Chapters 3 and 4) expands its output of valves and compressors by investing $40 million in a new manufacturing facility. Diaz Manufacturing’s auditor has determined that the new facility is a qualified investment and that the firm can recognize the full expense of this facility on its 2021 income statement. With a $40 million depreciation expense, and a 21 percent tax rate, Diaz Manufacturing’s federal tax bill will be $8.4 million (0.21 × $40 million = $8.4 million) lower than if it had no depreciation expense at all. This lower tax bill results in a 2021 CFOA that is $8.4 million larger.

Now, let’s compare the cash flow effect of bonus depreciation to the cash flows if the manufacturing facility is depreciated under a simple eight-year straight-line schedule. Under a straight-line schedule, Diaz would be allowed to expense $5 million per year in depreciation ($40 million/8 years = $5 million per year) for tax purposes. With a $5 million annual depreciation expense, Diaz Manufacturing’s tax obligations for the eight years beginning in 2021 will be $1.05 million lower than if the company had no depreciation expense for the new facility (0.21 × $5 million = $1.05 million). It is important to note that the cash flow benefit from straight-line depreciation accrues as an eight-year annuity due. If Diaz Manufacturing applies a 12 percent discount rate to its cash flow from operating activity, the present value of the tax benefits from straight-line depreciation can be calculated using Equation 6.3, as follows:

The present value of the incremental cash flows attributable to this straight-line depreciation schedule can be compared directly with the cash flow obtained under the 100 percent bonus depreciation schedule above. This comparison tells us that the bonus depreciation increases the present value of Diaz Manufacturing’s CFOA by $2.56 million ($8.4 million – $5.84 million = $2.56 million) relative to the eight-year straight-line schedule!

You might think that the bonus depreciation policy could also affect the cash flow invested in long-term assets (CFLTA), which is defined in Equation 3.6 as:

However, this is not the case. To see this, let’s review the impact of the acquisition of a long-term asset on the balance sheet. Diaz Manufacturing is expanding its manufacturing capacity with a $40 million investment. To ensure that the balance sheet accurately reflects this investment, Diaz Manufacturing will increase the gross plant and equipment line of the balance sheet by $40 million regardless of how the assets are depreciated. If the firm also applies 100 percent bonus depreciation to this investment, accumulated depreciation will also increase by $40 million, and net plant and equipment will be unchanged by this investment. In contrast, with less or no bonus depreciation, net plant and equipment will increase. However, as you may recall, we ignore accumulated depreciation when computing CFLTA and thus the choice of the depreciation schedule will not affect the calculation of CFLTA.

Interest Deduction and Cash Flow to Investors
The deductibility of interest expense for tax purposes is a very important benefit associated with the use of debt. As discussed in Chapter 3, all else equal, the deduction of interest as a pretax expense creates an interest tax shield for the firm. The ability to expense interest reduces taxes and increases CFOA and therefore CFI. The 2017 federal tax legislation altered the rules regarding the deductibility of interest paid by corporations on their debt. This important change limits the amount of interest that can be deducted when estimating a firm’s tax obligation, thereby reducing the size of the interest tax shield for some highly levered firms.

For tax years prior to 2018, there was no limit on the dollar amount of interest that could be deducted when calculating a firm’s tax obligation. For example, if a firm paid $1,000,000 of interest in a given year, the entire amount could be deducted when computing pretax profits. If the firm’s profits before interest and taxes were less than $1,000,000, then the firm would generate a tax loss that could be carried back or forward in time and applied against profits to reduce taxable income in another period. If the firm’s profits before interest and taxes exceeded $1,000,000, then its taxable income would be the difference between profits before interest and taxes and interest paid.

For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the 2017 federal tax legislation places a limit on the dollar amount of net interest that can be deducted before tax. Under the new rules, a firm’s deduction for net business interest (interest expense minus interest income) is limited to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income (ATI), which is a measure of pretax operating cash flow, EBITDA, in the current year.2

While the limits on the deductibility of interest will not have a significant impact on the CFOA for companies with little debt, it can reduce the CFOA and CFI for highly levered firms. In 2017, approximately 13 percent of publicly traded firms in the United States reported a ratio of net interest expense to EBITDA greater than 30 percent; thus, this feature of the 2017 federal tax bill would, all else equal, have resulted in a lower CFOA in 2017 for more than one out of every ten public firms had it been in effect.

To illustrate the impact that the limit on the deductibility of interest can have on CFOA and CFI, let’s consider a C-corporation with some debt in its capital structure and a 25 percent overall tax rate (including federal, state, and local taxes). The line items (in millions of dollars) in the following income statement are determined using the tax code that predates passage of the 2017 federal tax legislation:

Revenue	$100.0
Cost of goods sold	60.0
Depreciation	10.0
Net business interest expense	20.0
Pretax income	$ 10.0
Federal, state, and local tax at 25%	2.5
Net income	$ 7.5
In the above income statement, the firm deducts the full amount of net business interest paid during the fiscal year, and the interest tax shield is $5 million (0.25 × $20 million = $5 million). This reduction in the tax bill increased CFOA by an amount equal to the value of the interest tax shield.

Under the new rules for interest deductibility, the same firm would face a limit on the deductibility of interest that equals 30 percent of adjusted taxable income. The dollar value of this limit in the above example can be computed for the firm by first computing its ATI:

Pretax income under old tax rules	$10.0
Plus net business interest expense	20.0
Plus depreciation	10.0
Adjusted taxable income (ATI)	$40.0
Next, we multiply the $40 million of ATI by 0.30 to find that the firm can deduct only $12 million (0.30 × $40 million = $12 million) of the net business interest paid in the fiscal year when computing its federal taxes. With a 25 percent overall tax rate, if we assume for simplicity that the new deduction limit also applies to state and local taxes, the interest tax shield for the fiscal year is $3 million (0.25 × $12 million = $3 million), which is $2 million less than the tax shield under the previous federal tax law. From this example, it is clear that the 2017 federal tax legislation lowered the expected value of the interest tax shield for firms with net interest expense greater than 30 percent of ATI.

C.2 Corporate Taxes and the Cost of Capital
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Discuss and compute the impact of the 2017 federal tax law changes on the after-tax cost of debt and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a firm.
As we discussed in Section C.1, the 2017 federal tax legislation introduced a number of important changes in corporate tax rates and polices, including a limit on the net business interest expense that can be deducted when computing a C-corporation’s tax liability. This section discusses how to calculate the impact of the changes in corporate tax rates and the limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense on the cost of the debt capital and a firm’s overall weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

Corporate Tax Rates and the After-Tax Cost of Debt
As noted in Chapter 13, managers are concerned about the after-tax cost of the capital they obtain from their investors. This cost of capital for the firm can be measured as the weighted average of the costs of the different types of financing used by the firm. Virtually all firms use some form of debt financing, and the 2017 federal tax legislation changed the after-tax cost of debt financing for most firms. This concept is important because the actual cost of debt for a firm is lower if the government provides a tax break for interest expenses. More generally, the after-tax cost of debt is equal to the pretax cost times 1 minus the tax rate, t. To incorporate the effect of this tax break, the after-tax cost of debt is calculated in Equation 13.3 as:

As we noted in Section C.1, the establishment of a flat 21 percent federal tax rate by the 2017 federal tax legislation reduced the average tax rate for the majority of public companies in the United States. The implication of this change in the corporate tax rate is clear for the after-tax cost of debt. By reducing the corporate tax rate, the after-tax cost of debt increased for most firms. This is not because the actual cost of debt increased for firms, but because the benefit associated with the ability to deduct interest from pretax earnings is lower with a lower tax rate.

Interest Deduction and the After-Tax Cost of Debt
While the after-tax cost of debt increases as the tax rate decreases, the after-tax cost of debt can also be affected by limitations on the deductibility of interest when computing pretax income. The new tax provision that limits the net business interest expense deduction to 30 percent of the firm’s ATI reduced the value of the interest tax shield for firms that are affected by the 30 percent limit.

The impact that the 30 percent limit can have on the cash flows to investors at a highly levered firm is illustrated in Section C.1 for a corporation that has the following income statement under the old tax law (amounts are in millions of dollars).

Revenue	$100.0
Cost of goods sold	60.0
Depreciation	10.0
Net business interest expense	20.0
Pretax income	$ 10.0
Federal and state tax at 25%	2.5
Net income	$ 7.5
Let’s review these calculations and then extend them to illustrate the implications for cost of capital calculations.

Enactment of the 2017 federal tax legislation caused the above corporation’s net business interest deduction to decline from $20.0 million to $12.0 million. This is because the firm has an ATI of $40.0 million and 30 percent of $40.0 million equals $12.0 million ($40.0 million × 30 percent = $12.0 million).

With a 25 percent overall tax rate, this $8.0 million decline in the net business interest deduction increases the taxes that the firm must pay by $2.0 million ($8.0 million × 25 percent = $2.0 million) and decreases its net income (and cash flows to investors) by the same amount.3 The firm’s income statement after enactment of the 2017 legislation would be as follows:

Revenue	$100.0
Cost of goods sold	60.0
Depreciation	10.0
Net business interest expense	20.0
Pretax income	$ 10.0
Federal and state tax at 25%	4.5
Net income	$ 5.5
The $2.0 million tax increase also represents an increase in the cost of debt to the firm. For example, if the firm just issued debt with a market value of $400 million, a $2.0 million increase in taxes raises the after-tax percentage cost of debt by 0.5 percent ($2.0 million/$400.0 million = 0.005, or 0.5 percent).

To better understand how the limit on the deductibility of business interest under the 2017 federal tax legislation affected the cost of debt for the firm in our example, let’s calculate the after-tax cost of debt under the rules that existed before and after the legislation was enacted. For ease of exposition, we will keep the overall tax rate fixed at 25 percent in both examples to highlight only the effects of limits to the deductibility of net business interest.

After-Tax Cost of Debt Before the 2017 Federal Tax Legislation

We first calculate the pretax cost of debt, which is simply the annual net business interest expense of $20.0 million divided by $400.0 million.4 This pretax percentage cost equals 5.0 percent ($20.0 million/$400.0 million = 0.050, or 5.0 percent). Prior to the 2017 federal tax legislation, we could simply use the pretax cost of debt and the 25 percent tax rate in Equation 13.3 to calculate the after-tax cost of debt as follows:

Given the after-tax percentage cost of debt, we can calculate the corresponding after-tax dollar cost of debt to be $15.0 million (0.0375 × $400.0 million = $15.0 million). This is the actual cost of debt capital for the firm.

After-Tax Cost of Debt After the 2017 Federal tax Legislation

Under the 2017 federal tax legislation, the tax benefits of debt are limited because firms can deduct only net business interest equal to 30 percent of the firm’s ATI. For a firm with net business interest expense less than 30 percent of its ATI, the 2017 legislation will have no impact on the after-tax cost of debt relative to the prior policy of unlimited interest deductibility. However, for a firm with interest expense exceeding 30 percent of ATI, as is the case in this example, the computation of the after-tax cost of debt can be accomplished as follows:

First, calculate the maximum allowable net business interest deduction:

where:

Second, calculate the percentage of total net business interest expense that is deductible:

where:

Third, calculate the percentage tax shield under the 2017 federal tax legislation:

where:

Finally, calculate the after-tax cost of debt:

We have presented the individual steps taken to derive the after-tax cost of debt with limits on the deduction of interest from pretax earnings to help illustrate the intuition behind this computation. Fortunately, the calculations above can be combined into a single formula:

(C.1)
We only use Equation C.1 for calculations when the limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense affects the taxes that the firm pays (e.g., when its net business interest expense is more than 30 percent of its ATI). If the net business interest expense paid by the firm is less than or equal to 30 percent of its ATI, then we should use Equation 13.3 to calculate the firm’s after-tax cost of debt.

Now that we have derived the after-tax percentage cost of debt, we can calculate the corresponding dollar cost of debt after tax to be $17.0 million (0.0425 × $400.0 million = $17.0 million). This is the actual cost of debt capital for the firm when the pretax interest deduction is limited to 30 percent of ATI. In comparing the after-tax dollar cost of debt capital before and after the 2017 federal tax legislation, we can see that the limits on the deduction of interest from pretax earnings increased the dollar cost of debt for the firm by $2 million (from $15 million to $17 million). This figure corresponds to the firm’s increase in taxes resulting from an $8 million decline in the net interest deduction under the 2017 tax bill ($8.0 million × 25 percent = $2.0 million).

It is important to note that the reduction in the federal tax rate and the limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense only affect a firm’s overall cost of capital through their impact on the firm’s after-tax cost of debt. In other words, these characteristics of the 2017 federal tax legislation only affect kDebt pretax(1–t) in Equation 13.7:

They do not affect the costs of preferred or common stock.

Learning by Doing Application C.2 provides another example of the after-tax cost of debt with a limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense when computing pretax earnings. The application features multiple sources of debt financing and can be compared to Learning by Doing Application 13.2.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION C.2
Calculating the Cost of Debt

Problem

You have just successfully completed a leveraged buyout of the firm that you have been working for. To finance this $35 million transaction, you and three partners put up a total of $10 million in equity capital, and you borrowed $25 million from banks and other investors. The bank debt consists of $10 million of secured debt borrowed at a rate of 6 percent from Bank of America and $7 million of senior unsecured debt borrowed at a rate of 7 percent from JPMorgan Chase. The remaining $8 million was borrowed from an investment group managed by a private equity firm. The rate on this subordinated (junior) unsecured debt is 9.5 percent. What is the overall after-tax cost of the debt financing used to buy the firm under the 2017 federal tax legislation if you expect the firm’s adjusted taxable income (ATI) to equal $3 million and its average and marginal tax rates to both be 25 percent?





C.3 Capital Structure and the Impact of Changing Taxes
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Explain how tax law changes can alter firm value and a firm’s capital structure decisions.
As discussed in Section C.1, for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the 2017 federal tax legislation establishes a single corporate tax rate of 21 percent and places a limit on the dollar amount of net business interest expense that can be deducted when computing a firm’s tax obligation. Under the new rules, the tax deduction for net business interest expense is limited to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income (ATI), which is a measure of pretax operating cash flow, EBITDA, in the current year. From 2022 forward, the measure of ATI is scheduled to change from EBITDA to EBIT, suggesting an even greater limit on the deductibility of interest for firms with high depreciation and amortization expenses.

This section explores the implications of taxes and the 2017 federal tax legislation for a firm’s capital structure, value, and cost of capital. To see the effects that come into play, we first focus on the consequence of the lower tax rate on firm value and then incorporate the impact of the limit on interest deductibility. Finally, we look at how the tax reforms influence the cost of equity and weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

Corporate Tax Rates and the Value of the Firm with Debt
Recall from Chapter 16 that the trade-off theory of capital structure suggests that a firm’s managers trade off the costs and benefits of debt to maximize firm value. The tax savings associated with being able to deduct interest expense when computing pretax earnings, commonly referred to as the interest tax shield, is a key benefit of having debt in a firm’s capital structure. When a firm with little or no debt adds more debt, the tax shield arising from being able to deduct interest payments results in a reduction in the tax paid to the government, which increases the value of the firm’s cash flows that are received by the stockholders. In Section 16.2, we showed that when an all-equity firm adds debt, firm value increases by the present value of the interest tax shield. For perpetual debt, this change in value can be estimated using Equation 16.4 as follows:

As we noted in Section C.1, the imposition of a flat 21 percent federal tax rate lowered the average tax rate for the majority of public companies in the United States, resulting in increased after-tax cash flows and firm value. The lower tax rate also means that the value of the tax shield declined, but the amount of this decline will be smaller than the increase in value that results from the reduction in the tax rate. Thus, overall, firms with debt in their capital structure benefit from the lower tax rate. To examine the changes in firm value and WACC that take place with a lower tax rate, let’s revisit the Millennium Motors discussion in Section 16.2 and Exhibit 16.7 of the text.

In the first column of Exhibit 16.7, included below, we see that with zero debt Millennium Motors’ entire annual EBIT of $100 million is taxable at a 28 percent rate. (As we noted in Section C.1, companies pay state and local taxes in addition to the federal tax rate; thus, the blended tax rate actually paid is typically greater than 21 percent.) This leaves $72 million available for payment as dividends to stockholders [$100 million × (1 − 0.28) = $72 million]. Using the perpetuity formula and a 10 percent discount rate, the value of the unleveraged firm is $720 million ($72 million/0.10 = $720 million). In column 2, the value of the interest tax shield associated with new perpetual debt of $200 million is $56 million (D × t = $200 million × 0.28 = $56 million). Thus, firm value at the new debt level is $776 million, which is equal to the value of a firm that has no leverage plus the $56 million tax shield.

EXHIBIT 16.7 The Effect of Taxes on the Firm Value and WACC of Millennium Motors

The value of Millennium Motors increases and its WACC decreases with the amount of debt in the capital structure. The calculations assume that the cost of debt remains constant regardless of the amount of leverage and that the second and third M&M conditions apply.

Total debt
$0	$200	$400	$600	$800
Cost of debt	5.00%	5.00%	5.00%	5.00%	5.00%
EBIT	$100.00	$100.00	$100.00	$100.00	$100.00
Interest expense	0.0	10.00	20.00	30.00	40.00
Earnings before taxes	$100.00	$ 90.00	$ 80.00	$ 70.00	$ 60.00
Taxes (28%)	28.00	25.20	22.40	19.60	16.80
Net income	$ 72.00	$ 64.80	$ 57.60	$ 50.40	$ 43.20
Dividends	$ 72.00	$ 64.80	$ 57.60	$ 50.40	$ 43.20
Interest payments	0.0	10.00	20.00	30.00	40.00
Payments to investors	$ 72.00	$ 74.80	$ 77.60	$ 80.40	$ 83.20
 
Value of equity	$720.00	$576.00	$432.00	$288.00	$144.00
Cost of equity	10.00%	11.25%	13.33%	17.50%	30.00%
Firm value	$720.00	$776.00	$832.00	$888.00	$944.00
WACC	10.00%	9.28%	8.65%	8.11%	7.63%
In Exhibit C.2, we repeat the analysis above, but we now assume the tax rate for Millennium Motors is only the 21 percent federal tax rate to illustrate the impact of lower tax rates on the value of the firm. With zero debt, the firm’s after-tax cash flows would be $79 million per year [$100 million × (1 − 0.21) = $79 million]. Using the perpetuity formula, and assuming a 10 percent discount rate, the value of the unleveraged firm is $790 million ($79 million/0.10 = $790 million). Consistent with the discussion in Section C.1, paying less in taxes results in more cash flow to investors and increases in the value of Millennium Motors from $720 million with a 28 percent tax rate to $790 million.

EXHIBIT C.2 The Effect of Taxes on the Firm Value and WACC of Millennium Motors with a 21 Percent Tax Rate and No Limit on Interest Deductibility

The value of Millennium Motors and the value of equity are higher at every debt level when the tax rate declines to 21 percent. The calculations assume that the cost of debt remains constant regardless of the amount of leverage and that the second and third M&M conditions apply.

Total debt
$0	$200	$400	$600	$800
Cost of debt	5.00%	5.00%	5.00%	5.00%	5.00%
EBIT	$100.00	$100.00	$100.00	$100.00	$100.00
Interest expense	0.00	10.00	20.00	30.00	40.00
Earnings before taxes	$100.00	$ 90.00	$ 80.00	$ 70.00	$ 60.00
Taxes (21%)	21.00	18.90	16.80	14.70	12.60
Net income	$ 79.00	$ 71.10	$ 63.20	$ 55.30	$ 47.40
Dividends	$ 79.00	$ 71.10	$ 63.20	$ 55.30	$ 47.40
Interest payments	0.0	10.00	20.00	30.00	40.00
Payments to investors	$ 79.00	$ 81.10	$ 83.20	$ 85.30	$ 87.40
 
Value of equity	$790.00	$632.00	$474.00	$316.00	$158.00
Cost of equity	10.00%	11.25%	13.33%	17.50%	30.00%
Firm value	$790.00	$832.00	$874.00	$916.00	$958.00
WACC	10.00%	9.50%	9.04%	8.62%	8.25%
The second column of Exhibit C.2 illustrates the impact of the 21 percent tax rate on the value Millennium Motors with $200 million in perpetual debt. In this case, the value of the interest tax shield is $42 million ($200 million × 0.21 = $42 million). The total value of the firm is $832 million, which can be calculated as the value of the unleveraged firm plus the value of the tax shield ($790 million + $42 million = $832 million). Even though the value of the tax shield has fallen from $56 million at the tax rate of 28 percent to $42 million at the 21 percent rate, the value of the firm has increased from $760 million to $832 million because of the lower total tax payment.

If we compare the values in Exhibit 16.7 with those in Exhibit C.1, we can see that as debt increases, the tax bill paid by the firm is lower and the value of the firm is higher under the 21 percent tax rate. At the same time, for a given level of debt the proportion of debt in the capital structure is lower at the 21 percent tax rate, as firm value has increased. For example, when debt is $600 million and the tax rate is 28 percent, firm value is $888 million and the debt to value ratio is 67.5 percent ($600 million/$888 million = 0.675, or 67.5 percent). But at the 21 percent tax rate, with $600 million debt, firm value is $916 million and the debt to value ratio drops to 65.5 percent ($600 million/$916 million = 0.655, or 65.5 percent). In contrast, the cost of equity is the same under the two tax rates.5 Overall, while the reduction in the tax rate results in a lower interest tax shield, this is more than offset by the benefit from paying lower taxes.

Interest Deduction Limit, Payments to Investors, and the Value of the Firm
So far in this section, we have assumed that net business interest expense is fully deductible when computing pretax earnings. However, as we discussed in section C.2, the 2017 federal tax legislation limits the pretax net business interest deduction to 30 percent of ATI. For firms with net business interest expense below the 30 percent threshold, the limit to the deductibility of interest does not apply. However, when the interest on debt is above 30 percent of ATI, firms will effectively lose a portion of the tax shield, as some part of the interest payment is no longer deductible for tax purposes.6

Millennium Motors has no depreciation or amortization expense, so the firm’s EBIT and EBITDA are equal. Therefore, both of these pretax operating profit and cash flow measures are the same and equal to ATI in this example. Under the 2017 federal tax legislation, Millennium’s deductible interest is limited to 30 percent of ATI, or $30 million (0.3 × $100 million = $30 million), which is exactly equal to the interest owed by the firm when it has $600 million in debt.

To see what happens to firm value and WACC with the limit on pretax interest expense, let’s consider the case in which Millennium Motors issues perpetual debt of $800 million and a flat tax rate of 21 percent is applied to taxable income. This analysis appears in Exhibit C.3. Note that in the first four columns the values are the same as those in Exhibit C.2. This is because Millennium’s interest is fully deductible at these debt levels.

If we compare the values in the last column of Exhibit C.3 with those in the last column of Exhibit C.2, we see that when Millennium has $800 million of debt, the value of the firm drops from $958 million to $916 million. In contrast, the WACC increases from 8.25 percent in Exhibit C.2 to 8.62 percent in Exhibit C.3. The fact that interest on debt above $600 million is no longer deductible accounts for these differences.

EXHIBIT C.3 The Effect of Taxes on the Firm Value and WACC of Millennium Motors with a 21 Percent Tax Rate and a Limit on Interest Deductibility

The value of Millennium Motors and the value of equity are lower when there is a limit on the deductibility of interest payments. The calculations assume that the cost of debt remains constant regardless of the amount of leverage and that the second and third M&M conditions apply.

Let’s now look in more detail at how we calculate the values for Millennium Motors in Exhibit C.3. When debt is $800 million and the cost of debt is 5 percent, Millennium must pay interest of $40 million (0.05 × $800 million = $40 million). However, under the new tax policy, the firm can only deduct $30 million of net business interest expense when computing its taxes. The amount of earnings before taxes is thus $70 million ($100 million – $30 million = $70 million) and the firm has to pay taxes of $14.70 million (0.21 × $70 million = $14.70 million). This figure compares with a tax payment of $12.60 million when there is no limit on net business interest expense, as in Exhibit C.2. The firm is paying an additional $2.10 million ($14.70 million – $12.60 million = $2.10 million) in taxes each year with the limit on the deductibility of interest expense.

What does this mean for the payments to debt and equity holders? When net business interest expense is fully deductible, the after-tax cash flow of $47.40 million can be paid to the stockholders of Millennium Motors as a dividend. With limited deductibility, however, Millennium only expenses $30 million of the $40 million of interest owed to bondholders, and its net income equals $55.30 million (earnings before taxes of $70.00 million – taxes of $14.70 million = $55.30 million). However, once we account for the $10 million of interest expense that is not deductible, the stockholders of Millennium will only receive a dividend of $45.30 million ($55.30 million – $10.00 million = $45.30 million). In both cases, the interest paid to bondholders is $40 million. However, when interest is not fully deductible, Millennium Motors’ total annual payments to investors, in particular the payments to stockholders, are lower by the additional $2.10 million the firm pays in taxes. Since the total payments to investors decline, so does the value of the firm.

To determine firm value for Millennium under the deductibility limit, recall from Section 16.2 that the value of a firm with leverage can be calculated as the value of the unleveraged firm plus the present value of the interest tax shield. In the Millennium Motors example in Exhibit C.2, if the cash flows are a perpetuity and the discount rate is 10 percent, the value of the unleveraged firm is $790 million ($79.00 million of annual payments to investors/0.10 = $790 million).

Next, let’s compute the present value of the interest tax shield if the firm takes full advantage of the allowable net business interest expense deduction. Following our discussion in Section C.2, with ATI of $100 million (recall that ATI = EBITDA = EBIT in this example), the maximum interest deduction is calculated as:

where:

Given that the maximum level of deductible interest is lower than the $40 million in total interest to be paid to bondholders, we can compute the face value of the corresponding maximum value of debt with deductible interest given an interest rate (i) to be:

In other words, the company has $800 million in perpetual debt, but the present value of the interest tax shield is limited to the value associated with the maximum allowable net business interest expense deduction (DebtMaximum), which is $600 million. In the Millennium example, the value of the tax shield is $126 million ($600 million × 0.21 = $126 million) and the value of the firm is $916 million ($790 million + $126 million = $916 million). This compares with a value of $958 million when Millennium has $800 million in perpetual debt but there is no limit on interest deductions, as we can see in the last column of Exhibit C.2. Thus, with the limit on the deductibility of interest expense, Millennium’s firm value is $42 million less than when interest is fully deductible. This difference is equal to the value of the lost tax shield on $200 million in debt ($200 million × 0.21 = $42 million).

Note that, in this example, when the value of debt is $600 million or less, there is no difference in the firm value with or without the limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense. This is because with $600 million in debt the interest of $30 million is exactly equal to the $30 million limit on the deductibility of interest. At any debt level above $600 million, interest in excess of $30 million is no longer tax deductible, and there is no additional interest tax shield. If there is no tax advantage of debt beyond $600 million, this is the debt level at which Millennium’s interest tax shield and, all else equal, the firm’s value are maximized. With EBIT of $100 million for any amount of debt above $600 million, the amounts of deductible interest, taxable income, taxes payable, and firm value remain constant at their respective values when debt is equal to $600 million. We can also see that the cost of equity increases as debt increases beyond $600 million. However, this is not due to a tax effect. Rather, as we showed in Chapter 16, and Equation 16.3, this is due to stockholders demanding a higher return when debt increases to compensate for greater risk.

Learning by Doing Application C.3 presents another example of how to calculate the maximum allowable net business interest expense deduction and firm value while considering the interest deductibility limit.

Calculating the Maximum Allowable Interest Deduction and Firm Value

Problem

Santan Spirits Company has pretax operating cash flows (ATI) of $3.2 million, no debt in its capital structure, and no depreciation or amortization expenses. Santan is considering adding $18 million in new perpetual bank debt with an interest rate of 9 percent to expand and improve its warehouse and supply chain logistics. If the net business interest expense deduction is limited to 30 percent of ATI and there is a 21 percent flat tax rate, what is the maximum allowable interest expense for Santan, and what is the value of the firm if it issues this amount of new debt? Assume the discount rate for the unleveraged firm is 14 percent.



 

The Net Business Interest Expense Deduction Limit and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
Let’s now look in more detail at the WACC calculations for Millennium Motors when the firm has $800 million in debt and faces a limit on interest deductibility. The WACC formula can be written as Equation 13.7:

With just debt and equity in the capital structure, we use the equation:

To calculate the WACC for Millennium, we first determine the after-tax cost of debt with the limit on net business interest expense deductability using Equation C.1 as follows:

Next, we determine the cost of equity. We saw earlier that when Millennium has $800 million in debt, the value of the firm is $916 million. This tells us that the value of equity is $116 million (Vcs = VFirm − VDebt = $116 million = $916 million – $800 million).

Recall from Chapter 16 and M&M Proposition 2 that the return on common equity can be calculated using Equation 16.5:

If net business interest expense is at or below the deductibility limit, we can use Equation 16.5 to calculate the return on common equity. If the net business interest expense is above the deductibility limit, we can show that the M&M Proposition 2 formula for the return on common equity is:

(C.2)
This looks very similar to Equation 16.5 but has one term for the portion of debt where interest is deductible and another for the portion of debt where interest is not deductible.7 With a 5 percent pretax cost of debt and 10 percent return on assets, we can use Equation C.2 to calculate the return on equity for Millennium Motors as:

Finally, we determine the weights of debt and equity in the capital structure. With a firm value of $916 million, debt of $800 million, and equity of $116 million, the weight of debt is 0.8734 ($800 million/$916 million = 0.8734) and the weight of equity is 0.1266 ($116 million/$916 million = 0.1266).

Given the cost of debt and equity, as well as their respective weights in the capital structure, we can compute the WACC for Millennium Motors as follows:

Learning by Doing Application C.4 presents another example of how to calculate the weighted average cost of capital if there is a limit to the deductibility of net business interest expense when computing pretax earnings.

LEARNING BY DOING APPLICATION C.4
Calculating the WACC

Problem

Eyespy Corporation sells internet-connected security monitoring systems. The firm currently has no debt, a return on equity of 8 percent, and a blended local, state, and federal tax rate of 25 percent. The firm is expected to generate EBIT of $39 million per year in perpetuity and has no depreciation or amortization expenses. Under the 2017 federal tax law, Eyespy’s chief financial officer (CFO) has determined that with $220 million of debt, the firm’s value is $414.38 million. She has asked you to calculate the firm’s weighted average cost of capital at this debt level. Assume that the interest deductibility limit is 30 percent of ATI.





Taxes and Capital Structure Theory
We have shown that lowering the tax rate reduces the value of the interest tax shield but increases cash flows to investors and firm value. When adding the impact of the net business interest deduction limit, we saw that the value of a firm whose interest expense is below the limit did not change as a result of the 2017 federal tax legislation. However, a firm with net business interest expense above the limit incurred a loss of tax shields and a decline in value. We also showed that, holding everything else constant, firm value is maximized when net interest payments just equal the 30 percent of ATI deductibility limit, and that this value does not change for debt levels where net business interest expense exceeds the deductibility limit.

To maximize firm value, managers who apply the trade-off view of capital structure will still adjust the firm’s capital structure to the point where the costs and benefits of adding another dollar of debt are exactly equal. For firms whose net business interest expense is below the interest deductibility limit, adding debt leads to additional tax shields and, depending on the corresponding costs, possibly an increase in firm value. But as we said, firms whose net business interest expense is above the limit already receive the maximum interest tax shield and would not receive an additional tax benefit from increasing the amount of debt in their capital structure.

In contrast, a manager who follows the pecking order view on capital structure will continue to rely on internal funds. With a lower tax rate, the cash flow from operating activity is higher, providing more internal funds for investment. If the firm requires more capital than the additional internal cash flows provide, then as we discuss in Chapter 16, managers will first issue debt and will only sell stock when debt is unavailable or unattractively expensive.

Practical Considerations in Adjusting Capital Structure

In practice, research suggests that firms’ capital structures change following tax changes and that these changes are often less than trade-off models would predict.9 Further, as we note in Section 16.4, there are many other factors that managers raise when talking about capital structure choices, including financial flexibility, risk, and earnings impact. How might changing tax rates and deductibility limits relate to these issues?

Recall that financial flexibility is the ability to take on positive net present value projects, while the term risk in this context refers to managers’ concerns about the volatility of cash flows and earnings. Such volatility can complicate relationships with outside investors who dislike unpredictable earnings or in some cases can put the firm at risk of bankruptcy. For many firms, a lower tax rate would improve financial flexibility, as both cash flows and firm value increase while the proportion of debt in the capital structure decreases. All else equal, these changes would reduce risk, while making it easier to raise new capital, thus increasing financial flexibility. However, for other firms, especially those above the deductibility limit, the opposite is likely true. Firms above the limit will pay more taxes and have lower cash flows, lower firm value, and a greater proportion of debt in the capital structure. All of these changes can detract from financial flexibility and increase risk.

Even though financial theory tells us that managers should only be concerned with cash flows, they often focus on accounting earnings. Under the tax law changes, firms paying lower taxes will experience an increase in the dollar value of net income and in earnings per share. We might expect these firms to stay at their current capital structure. In contrast, for firms paying more taxes, the dollar value of net income and earnings per share will decrease and managers at these companies might reduce debt to offset the decline in earnings numbers.

Summary of Learning Objectives
1 Describe the major federal tax law changes adopted under H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in 2017 and explain how these changes affect cash flow from operating activity and cash flow to investors.

The adoption of H.R. 1 in December 2017 introduced a number of important changes in corporate tax rates and policies. These changes include eliminating the progressive corporate tax rates used in prior years and replacing them with a single “flat” federal corporate rate of 21 percent. In addition to modifying corporate tax rates, the 2017 federal tax legislation implemented a number of changes for the recognition of pretax expenses. One of the most important changes was the expansion of “bonus depreciation,” which allows for a significant first-year depreciation deduction for qualified assets. Under the 2017 legislation, firms can recognize 100 percent of the depreciation expense for an asset in the first year of its use, doubling the 50 percent bonus depreciation that was in place under prior tax law. Finally, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the legislation places a limit on the dollar amount of net interest that can be deducted from pretax earnings. Under this law, a firm’s deduction for net business interest (interest expense minus interest income) is limited to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income (ATI).

The new corporate tax rate of 21 percent is lower than all but the lowest marginal rate of 15 percent which was applied to the first $50,000 of taxable earnings under the previous tax law. Beyond the first $50,000, firms pay a lower marginal tax rate for each additional dollar of taxable income under the new flat rate. This results in higher cash flow from operating activities (CFOA) and cash flow to investors (CFI). Bonus depreciation has a positive impact on CFOA and CFI for firms investing in long-term assets. With 100 percent depreciation, firms are able to fully recognize the cost of an investment in a fixed asset in the year of the investment and, thus, do not have to defer any of the tax benefits of depreciation to later years. The new limits to the deductibility of net business interest from pretax earnings will increase the taxes paid and lower CFOA and CFI for firms whose interest expense exceeds 30 percent of ATI.

2 Discuss and compute the impact of the 2017 federal tax law changes on the after-tax cost of debt and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a firm.

The 2017 federal tax law changes increased the after-tax cost of debt. The lower 21 percent federal tax rate, all else equal, reduces the value of the interest tax shield. The new tax provision that limits the net business interest expense deduction to 30 percent of the firm’s ATI reduced the value of the interest tax shield and increased the cost of debt capital for firms with net business interest expense that exceeds 30 percent of their ATI. Equation C.1 can be used to calculate the after-tax cost of debt with the new 21 percent rate and limited deductibility of interest.

The reduction in the federal tax rate and the limit on the deductibility of net business interest expense only affect a firm’s overall cost of capital through their impact on the firm’s after-tax cost of debt. The legislation does not have a direct impact on the cost of preferred and common stock.

3 Explain how tax law changes can alter firm value and a firm’s capital structure decisions.

The reduction in the corporate tax rate results in higher after-tax cash flow to investors and, all else equal, increases the present value of the firm. The tax law also imposes limits on the ability to deduct net business interest to 30 percent of ATI. This change reduces the present value of the interest tax shield when a company’s ATI exceeds this threshold. Under the trade-off theory of capital structure, a decline in the present value of the interest tax shield reduces the benefits of debt financing. In contrast, a decline in the tax shield has no effect on the use of debt in the pecking order theory. Under the pecking order theory, managers view internally generated funds or cash on hand as the cheapest source of capital. The relative benefits of debt may decline with the new tax policies, but it is still less expensive than raising money by selling stock.

Questions and Problems
Basic
C.1 Taxes and cash flows: Jiffy Packing Inc. generated $3.45 million in earnings before taxes (EBT) in both fiscal years 2017 and 2018. In which year did Jiffy Packing likely have a higher cash flow from operating activity?

C.3 Depreciation and cash flow: The CFO of Granger Garden Supplies developed a plan to invest $1.2 million in a new manufacturing facility in 2018. During the planning process, the 2017 federal tax legislation was enacted, increasing the first-year bonus depreciation for facilities like this from 50 percent to 100 percent. The firm has a 23 percent tax rate, has $9.8 million in EBITDA, and had no interest expense in 2018. What is the increase in cash flow from operating activity (CFOA) for Granger in 2018 that is attributable to the additional depreciation expense allowed under the 2017 tax legislation?

Intermediate
C.4 Taxes and the cost of debt: Swift Construction Inc. has 2021 EBIT of $1.6 million, a 23 percent tax rate, a 7 percent rate of interest on its bank loan, and net business interest expense of $650,000. Under the 2017 federal tax legislation, what is the company’s after-tax cost of debt?

C.5 After-tax cost of a bond before the 2017 federal tax legislation:

Perpetual Ltd. has issued 500,000 bonds that never require the principal amount to be repaid to investors. Correspondingly, Perpetual must make interest payments into the infinite future. If the bondholders receive annual payments of $75 and the current price of each of these bonds is $882.35, what would the after-tax cost of this debt be for Perpetual if the 2017 federal tax legislation had not been adopted and the firm was subject to a 40 percent average and marginal tax rate?
After-tax cost of a bond after the 2017 federal tax legislation: The debt issue in part (a) is the only debt that Perpetual Ltd. has outstanding, and the company has no interest income. Assume that the 2017 tax legislation just became effective and reduced Perpetual’s average and marginal tax rate to 21 percent. What is the after-tax cost of this debt if the company has adjusted taxable income (ATI) of $90 million?
C.6 Interest tax shield: JAF, Inc. has $500 million of debt outstanding at an interest rate of 9 percent. Assume that interest payments are fully deductible for tax purposes and that debt is perpetual.

If the tax rate falls from 30 percent to 21 percent, how will JAF’s value change? Explain your answer.
Advanced
C.7 WACC calculation before and after the 2017 federal tax legislation:

It is 2017 (before the 2017 federal tax legislation takes effect) and the Imaginary Products Co. currently has debt with a market value of $300 million outstanding. The debt consists of 9 percent coupon bonds (semiannual coupon payments), which have a maturity of 15 years and are currently priced at $1,440.03 per bond. The firm also has of 2 million preferred shares outstanding with a market price of $12.00 per share. The preferred shares pay an annual dividend of $1.20. Imaginary also has 14 million shares of common stock outstanding with a price of $20.00 per share. The firm is expected to pay a $2.20 common dividend one year from today, and that dividend is expected to increase by 5 percent per year forever. If Imaginary is subject to a 40 percent average and marginal tax rate, what is the firm’s weighted average cost of capital?
Impact on WACC of the reduction in the tax rate due to the 2017 tax legislation: Now, consider that the 2017 federal tax legislation has just passed, reducing the average and marginal tax rate at the Imaginary Products Co. to 25 percent and limiting the net business interest deduction to 30 percent of the adjusted taxable income (ATI). Ignoring the limit of the net interest deduction for the moment, using the financial data for 2017 in part (a), what impact does the reduction in the tax rate alone have on the WACC of the Imaginary Products Co.?
Impact on cost of debt and WACC of the reduction in the tax rate and limit on net business interest deduction due to the 2017 federal tax legislation: If Imaginary’s adjusted taxable income (ATI) equals $40 million, what is the impact of the reduction in the tax rate and limitation on the net business interest deduction to 30 percent of ATI on the cost of debt and the WACC of the Imaginary Products Co.? In these calculations, use the financial data for 2017 that are given in part (a).
C.8 Firm value with limited interest deductibility: You own all of the equity in the Huson Holdings Company. The firm is currently debt free and will generate adjusted taxable income (ATI) of $40 million each year in perpetuity. The return on assets, kAssets, is 10 percent, the tax rate is 21 percent, and the maximum amount of interest that can be deducted for tax purposes is 30 percent of ATI.

What is the value of the all-equity firm?
If Huson Holdings decided to replace $15 million of equity by borrowing $15 million at an interest rate of 8.5 percent, what would the value of the firm be?
Notes
1 With $90,384 in taxable income, the firm’s tax bill under the past tax brackets can be computed as: Tax bill = (0.15 × $50,000) + [0.25 × ($75,000 – $50,000)] + [0.34 × ($90,384 – $75,000)] = $7,500 + $6,250 + $5,230.56 = $18,980.56. Given this total tax bill, the average tax rate paid by the firm is 21 percent ($18,980.56 / $90,384 = 0.21, or 21 percent), which is identical to the flat corporate tax rate introduced in the 2017 tax reform bill.
2 Adjusted taxable income is taxable income not taking into account (1) nonbusiness income, like gains from the sale of assets held for investment, (2) business interest expense or business interest income, (3) net operating loss deductions, (4) a new 20 percent qualified business income deduction, or (5) depreciation, amortization, or depletion. This is essentially pretax operating cash flow, EBITDA, in the current year, as we define it in Chapter 12. From tax year 2022 forward, the definition of ATI will change from EBITDA to EBIT, resulting in a greater limit to the deductibility interest expense.
3 As discussed in the previous section, the firm’s interest tax shield declines from $5.0 million ($20.0 million × 0.25 = $5.0 million) to $3.0 million ($12.0 million × 0.25 = $3.0 million). For simplicity, the tax calculations in this section assume that the limit on net business interest deductions applies to state and local taxes in addition to federal taxes. If it only applies to federal taxes, and the federal tax rate is 21 percent, the firm’s interest tax shield will decline from $5.0 million ($20.0 million × 0.25 = $5.0 million) to $3.32 million [($12.0 million × 0.21) + ($20.0 million × 0.04) = $3.32 million], a decrease of $1.68 million.
4 We are assuming that there is no business interest income, so the annual business interest expense equals annual net business interest expense.
5 As the tax rate changes, the changes in the value of equity and thus the D/E ratio offset the lower tax rate and result in the same cost of equity at each debt level.
6 Firms are permitted to carry forward nondeductible interest and expense it in future years. However, if the interest on debt is continually above the 30 percent threshold, a firm might never be able to use the carry-forward.
7 Note that if debt is at (or below) the maximum, then (VDebt – VDebt_Maximum) is zero or negative, and we would just use Equation 16.5.
8 We can also calculate the cost of equity as the dividends payable to shareholders divided by the value of equity. For example, in the second column of Exhibit C.2, with $800 million debt and the limit on interest deductibility, the dividend payment is $45.30 million and the value of equity is $116 million. The return to equity is thus 39.05 percent ($45.30 million/$116 million × 100 = 39.05 percent).

1. Use the properties of equations and inequalities to evaluate expressions and solve for desired values.
Solving for a Variable
(Solving for one of the variables in terms of the others in a formula or equation.)

Algebra is full of opportunities to solve for x. You have one answer if you’re working on a linear equation, a possible two answers in quadratic equations, and so on. And sometimes you get to solve for a variable in terms of other variables. For example, if you start with the distance formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate of speed, and t is the amount of time spent going at that rate, then you may want to solve for t. Why? Because you know it’s 300 miles to the lake, and you know that you may go at different rates of speed (depending on who is driving). Solving for t, you get 
 
.

So, if Claire is driving at 50 miles per hour, it’ll take 
 
. But, if Cassie is driving at 60 mph, then it’ll only take 
 
.

Example

Solve for degrees Fahrenheit in the conversion formula
 
. Then use the new version to determine what 37°C is equivalent to on the Fahrenheit scale.

To isolate the F, first multiply each side of the equation by 
 
:

 
 
 
Then add 32 to each side of the equation:

 
So the conversion formula for changing degrees centigrade to Fahrenheit is:

To use this new version, replace the degrees centigrade with a number and get the degrees Fahrenheit. What is 37° equivalent to?

Example

Solve for P in the formula A = P + Prt.

First factor the P from the two terms on the right: A = P(1 + rt).

Next, divide each side by 1 + rt:

So

Example

Solve for R in .

First multiply each side of the equation by the denominator, R − g:

Now distribute the terms on the left: P0(R − g) = D1 becomes P0R − P0g = D1. Next, add P0g to each side of the equation:

You now have P0R = D1 + P0g, so divide each side by P0:

Proportions
(Taking advantage of the properties of proportions to solve for unknowns and determine ratios.)

A proportion is an expression in which two fractions are equal to one another. For example, is a proportion. The two fractions have the same numerical value. One quick check, to assure yourself that you have a proportion, is to cross-multiply. Note that the two cross-products, 4 × 6 and 3 × 8, have the same product. This is one of the properties of proportions. There are other very helpful properties, also.

Properties of Proportions

If , then:

ad = bc
The cross-products are equal.
The “flip” of the proportion is also true.
You can reduce vertically in one fraction, and the proportion remains true.
You can reduce horizontally in the two fractions, and the proportion remains true.
These properties are very useful when working with proportions.

Example

Find the value of x that makes the proportion true.

You could cross-multiply, but that introduces a fairly large number. First reduce the fraction on the left vertically by dividing by 9.

Dividing 27 and 72 by 9:

The numbers are much better, but you can reduce again, horizontally, because both top numbers are divisible by 3.

Dividing 3 and 15 by 3:

Now, cross-multiplying, you have: 1 · x = 8 · 5 or x = 40.

The original proportion, with the x replaced is . To check this, you multiply 27 × 40 = 1080 and you multiply 72 × 15 = 1080.

Example

Solve for R in

At first glance, the equation doesn’t look like a proportion, but if you put the P0 in a fraction, you have one.

The advantage of writing the equation as a proportion is that you can use the properties of proportions to solve for R. One property is that the “flip” of a proportion is always true, so:

Now, to isolate the top of the right fraction, multiply each side of the equation by D1:

Add g to each side, and you have:

Example

If the ratio of lemonade to sweetened iced tea in an Arnold Palmer is 4 ounces of lemonade to 5 ounces of iced tea, then how much lemonade do you have to add to 3 gallons of sweetened iced tea to create this famous mixture?

First, convert the 3 gallons of iced tea to ounces. There are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon. So 3 gallons is 128 × 3 = 384 ounces of iced tea.

Now, write a proportion involving the lemonade and iced tea:

Cross-multiplying and solving for x:

You need to add just a little over 307 ounces of lemonade to the iced tea.

Inequalities
(Using and interpreting the properties of inequalities.)

An inequality is a statement of comparison of two or more entities. You can say that “7 is greater than 4” using the symbols: 7 > 4. If you want to allow for the possibility of equality between two items, you can write “x is less than or equal to 10,000” using the symbols x ≤ 10,000.

When you have a mathematical inequality statement, you can add or subtract the same thing from each side and not change the truth of the statement.

Quick Math Fact

When given a < b or a ≤ b, you can add or subtract the same thing from each side and not change the truth of the statement. It will be true that: a + c < b + c, a − c < b − c, a + c ≤ b + c, and a − c ≤ b − c.

Example

Add 6 to each side of the inequality x − 6 > 4.

This tells you that x represents a number greater than 10. So, if you replace x in the original statement with any number greater than 10, you’ll have a true statement.

Just to demonstrate, here’s what happens if you replace x with 13: 13 − 6 > 4 becomes 7 > 4. True!

Example

Subtract 11 from each side of the inequality 14 ≤ y + 11.

This says that 3 is less than or equal to y or that y is greater than or equal to 3. So any number, 3 or greater, can replace the y, and you have a true statement.

Just to show you how it works, here’s what happens when you let y be 8: 14 ≤ 8 + 11 which is 14 ≤ 19. And what about when y is 3? 14 ≤ 3 + 11 or 14 ≤ 14. They can be equal, also.

Quick Math Fact

When given a < b or a ≤ b, you can multiply or divide each side by the same positive number and not change the truth of the statement. So you can say that if c is positive:

However, if c is negative, then the inequalities get reversed. So, if c is negative:

Example

Divide each side of the inequality 6x ≥ 30 by 6.

Example

Multiply each side of the inequality by −7.

When multiplying by a negative number, you reverse the inequality sign, making it < instead of >.

This says that y has to be smaller than 21 to keep the inequality true. Try replacing the y in the original inequality with 14 to check this.

Yes, −2 is greater than −3 (think in terms of outside temperature).

Example

Jack and Jeff are on a seesaw. Jack weighs 200 pounds and Zack weighs 175 pounds. In order for the seesaw to tilt to Zack’s side, you have to give Jeff a box weighing at least how many pounds?


Think of this as being the inequality: Z + b > J, or Zack’s weight plus the weight of the box is greater than Jack’s weight.

Replacing the Z with 175 and the J with 200, you have: 175 + b > 200.

Subtracting 175 from each side, you get b > 25. So the box has to weigh more than 25 pounds.

0.2 Order of Operations
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

2. Perform simplifications and evaluations of expressions using the correct processes based on the mathematical order of operations.
Adding, Subtracting, Multiplying, Dividing
(Perform computations of complex expressions using the order of operations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.)

The order of operations is a set of rules developed by mathematicians so they could talk to one another. Just like you have to learn another language if you’re going to live in a new country, mathematicians agreed on the language of mathematics, so they could understand what the others meant. With everyone “speaking” the same language, the answers come out the same and the meaning is understood.

What is the order of operations? A favorite mnemonic is PEMDAS: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally (or Pink Elephants Make Darned Acceptable Sweethearts). Whatever you use, this is designed to help you remember the order in which you perform mathematical operations when you’re faced with two or more choices.

PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction

Putting things just a bit differently, think of the order of operations as:

Perform all powers and roots, in order from left to right*
Perform all multiplication and division, in order from left to right*
Perform all addition and subtraction, in order from left to right*
* Any grouping symbols (parentheses, brackets, braces, fraction lines, radicals) take precedence—perform the operations within grouping symbols before applying the result to the general order.

The operations of multiplication and division have equal weight. When moving from left to right, neither takes precedence over the other. The same holds for addition and subtraction and for powers and roots.

Concentrating on the four basic arithmetic operations, here are some examples.

Example

Compute 12 + 3 − 8 ÷ 4 + 11 + 14 × 3

The order of operations dictates that you perform the division and multiplication, first.

Performing the division, you have:

And performing the multiplication:

Now add and subtract, moving from left to right:

Since the rest of the operations are the same, just add 13 + 11 + 42 to get 66.

Just to illustrate how important this rule is, look at what happens if the rules aren’t followed. The following shows the results of performing the operations from left to right in the current order, without using the order of operations.

Example

Compute 80 + 64 ÷ 16 ÷ 8 ÷ 4

The three divisions are performed, first, moving from left to right.

It would be very tempting to do the division from right to left and avoid fractions. But this is why the rules are so important. You want everyone to get the same answer—and not make up their own rules.

Example

Compute 70 − 60 ÷ 10 + 4 × 5

Perform the division, then the multiplication, then subtraction, and, lastly, addition.

Powers
(Perform computations of complex expressions involving powers of single terms and compound expressions.)

The order of operations is a set of rules developed over the centuries so that mathematical and other scientific findings could be read by others in different countries, cities, and places of learning. The order of operations is a mathematical language that is accepted by everyone—we all speak this same language.

What is the order of operations? A favorite mnemonic is PEMDAS: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally (or Picking Easy Methods Decreases Anxiety Significantly). Whatever you use, this is designed to help you remember the order in which you perform mathematical operations when you’re faced with two or more choices.

PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction

Putting things just a bit differently, think of the order of operations as:

Perform all powers and roots, in order from left to right*
Perform all multiplication and division, in order from left to right*
Perform all addition and subtraction, in order from left to right*
* Any grouping symbols (parentheses, brackets, braces, fraction lines, radicals) take precedence—perform the operations within grouping symbols before applying the result to the general order.

The operations of multiplication and division have equal weight. When moving from left to right, neither takes precedence over the other. The same holds for addition and subtraction and for powers and roots.

Concentrating on using powers (exponents), here are some examples.

Example

Compute 72 + 3 × 4 − (6 − 3)3

The order of operations says to perform powers before multiplication or addition. Note that there’s a subtraction problem within parentheses. The order of operations also says that grouping symbols (parentheses are one) come before anything.

Simplify within the parentheses first:

Next, raise the 7 and 3 to their respective powers:

Perform the multiplication before addition or subtraction:

Add 49 to 12, and then subtract 27 from the result:

Example

Compute (−5)2 − 32 + 42 − (−6)2

This problem contains some “tricky” situations. When you square a negative number, the result is positive. Consider squaring −9. This is the same as −9 times −9 which is +81, because there are two negative numbers. The trickiness in this problem has more to do with reading it correctly—using the notation the right way. The steps will point out the pitfalls.

According to the order of operations, you have to perform the four powers (squares) before subtracting or adding.

First, square the −5:

Next, square the 3:

Notice that the −5 was in parentheses. You were squaring a negative number. The 3 is technically a +3; the negative sign indicates subtraction—which is done later.

Now square the 4:

The final power is squaring the −6:

Now the subtraction, addition, and subtraction can be performed from left to right:

Example

Compute (17 − 11)2 + (2 + 3)3

According to the order of operations, you perform the subtraction and addition in the parentheses before performing the powers.

This next example looks somewhat like the first, but there’s a variable in the parentheses, so the two terms can’t be added or subtracted.

Quick Math Fact

When squaring or cubing a binomial (two terms), use the following rule/pattern.

Example

Compute (3 + p)2 + (3 − p)2

Using the rules for squaring binomials:

The two 6p terms are opposites, so they add to 0. Combining the other like-terms:

Quick Math Fact

The area of a circle is found with the formula A = πr2 where r is the radius of the circle the estimate of π is usually either 3.14 or .

Example

Find the area of the circle shown.


The radius of the circle is 5 inches. Putting this value in the formula:

By the order of operations, you square the 5, first:

Now, multiply by 3.14:

Distributing
(Perform simplifications and computations of complex expressions using the distribution property.)

The order of operations is a set of rules developed by mathematicians so they could talk to one another. When mathematicians and other scholars in different countries, different cities, different buildings, and even at different desks perform mathematical operations, you want them all to get the same answer. That’s why the rules were established.

What is the order of operations? A favorite mnemonic is PEMDAS: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally (or Puffy Ears May Deafen Any Sound). Whatever you use, this is designed to help you remember the order in which you perform mathematical operations when you’re faced with two or more choices.

PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction

Putting things just a bit differently, think of the order of operations as:

Perform all powers and roots, in order from left to right*
Perform all multiplication and division, in order from left to right*
Perform all addition and subtraction, in order from left to right*
* Any grouping symbols (parentheses, brackets, braces, fraction lines, radicals) take precedence—perform the operations within grouping symbols before applying the result to the general order.

The operations of multiplication and division have equal weight. When moving from left to right, neither takes precedence over the other. The same holds for addition and subtraction and for powers and roots.

Concentrating on distributing through parentheses, here are some examples.

Example

Simplify 8 (5 + x − z + 3 − 4x)

The order of operations dictates that you simplify the terms within parentheses before performing an operation on them.

The 5 and 3 can be added together, and the 4x can be subtracted from x:

Now the 8 multiplies each term in the parentheses.

So 8 (5 + x − z + 3 − 4x) = 64 − 24x − 8z

Example

Compute 5 + [3 − 9 (4 + 12 ÷ 2)]

You find both brackets and parentheses here. They have the same “power” and are used in the same expression to make it easier to read what is to be done.

Quick Math Fact

When simplifying expressions with multiple grouping symbols, work from the “inside out”. a[b + c(d + e)]: simplify the d + e first.

The parentheses contain addition and division. Using the order of operations, perform the division first:

The brackets contain subtraction and multiplication. Perform the multiplication first:

Now add the two numbers together to get: 5 + [−87] = −82

Example

Simplify the expression used when finding the average rate: r1(a) + r2(b − a) + r3(c − b) if r1 = 0.02, r2 = 0.03, r3 = 0.01.

Replacing the rates in the expression:

Now distribute over the parentheses:

The terms in a and b can be combined:

The order of operations says to do the computations in the parentheses before multiplying by the outside number, but there are times when it just makes more sense (and is easier) if you distribute a number over the terms first. In the following example, you avoid adding fractions if you distribute.

Example

Compute

Multiply each fraction in the parentheses by 6:

Much nicer.

Fraction Lines and Radicals as Grouping Symbols
(Perform computations on expressions involving fractions and/or radicals.)

The order of operations is a set of rules which tell you in which order to perform various mathematical operations. This ordering of steps is necessary so that everyone gets the same answer to the same problem (assuming that they know their addition tables, etc.). The order of operations is used by all mathematicians, scientists, economists, and so on, throughout the world.

What is the order of operations? A favorite mnemonic is PEMDAS: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally (or Pigs Eat More Diet Advantageous Supplements). Whatever you use, this is designed to help you remember the order in which you perform mathematical operations when you’re faced with two or more choices.

PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction

Putting things just a bit differently, think of the order of operations as:

Perform all powers and roots, in order from left to right*
Perform all multiplication and division, in order from left to right*
Perform all addition and subtraction, in order from left to right*
* Any grouping symbols (parentheses, brackets, braces, fraction lines, radicals) take precedence—perform the operations within grouping symbols before applying the result to the general order.

The operations of multiplication and division have equal weight. When moving from left to right, neither takes precedence over the other. The same holds for addition and subtraction and for powers and roots.

Grouping symbols such as parentheses and brackets are easy to spot and suggestive of the rule, but fraction lines and radicals work the same when they’re encountered in a problem.

Example

Compute

According to the order of operations, you perform the operations in the parentheses and in the numerator (top) of the fraction before applying the others.

The parentheses contain a power and subtraction. Find the power first:

The numerator of the fraction contains multiplication and subtraction. You perform the multiplication first:

The power is performed next:

Now the operations to be performed are subtraction, multiplication, and division. Do the multiplication, and then the division:

And, finally the subtraction and addition can be performed in that order, from left to right:

Example

Compute

The radical acts as a grouping symbol, and the computation under the radical has to be performed before multiplying by 10.

Find the powers of 5 and 4 before subtracting:

You find the square root before multiplying:

Almost everyone’s “favorite” formula from algebra is the quadratic formula. You factored quadratics when you could, but the formula came into play when factoring wasn’t possible or was too difficult to perform.

Quick Math Fact

The roots (solutions) of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are found with:

Example

Use the quadratic formula to find the roots of 2x2 − 7x − 15 = 0

First, identify the a, b, and c that will be used in the formula:

Putting these values in the formula:

First, concentrate on the operations under the radical. You square the −7, first:

Next, perform the multiplication of 4 (2)(−15) under the radical:

Now subtract under the radical:

The square root of 169 is 13:

In the numerator, the negative of −7 is 7, and in the denominator, the multiplication needs to be performed:

There are two different operations that need to be performed in the numerator, giving the two different roots of the original equation:

In both cases, the computation in the numerator is done first:

The two answers are x = 5 or .

Logarithmic and Exponential Forms
(Convert between an exponential form and its corresponding logarithmic form using the laws of logarithms and exponents.)

Exponential expressions and logarithmic expressions are related because they’re inverses of one another. The relationship allows you to solve for an unknown value when investigating models involving growth—steady increases in an investment or steady decreases in mass.

Quick Math Fact

If b > 0, then

Example

Write the log expression log101000 = 3 as an exponential expression.

Using logb(y) = x ↔ y = bx, the base of the log, 10, becomes the base in the exponential form, and the 3 is its exponent.

Example

Write the exponential expression 25 = 32 as a logarithmic expression.

Using y = bx ↔ logb(y) = x, the base of the log is 2, and the exponent is what the log is set equal to.

Example

Solve for x in the equation log10(100) = x.

First, change the equation from the logarithmic to the exponential form:

Next, change the 100 to a power of 10:

The exponents on 10 must be the same, so x = 2.

Example

Solve for z in the equation log5(z) = 3.

First, change the equation from the logarithmic to the exponential form:

Now just do the computation: 53 = 125 = z.

Quick Math Fact

The logarithms that are base e use “ln” to indicate loge. These are called the natural logarithms. Base 10 logarithms, log10, are frequently abbreviated “log” and are referred to as common logarithms.

Example

Write the log expression ln 345 = x as an exponential expression.

Using ln(y) = x ↔ y = ex, the base of the log is e, so the e becomes the base of the exponential term. The exponent of the term is x.

Example

Write the log expression ln e−4 = x as an exponential expression.

Using ln(y) = x ↔ y = ex, the base of the log is e, so the e becomes the base of the exponential term.

The exponent of the term is x.

You can now solve for x, which must be equal to −4.

Quick Math Fact

A logarithmic expression can be changed to a more convenient base (a base found in a scientific calculator or table) using the formula:

Example

Change the logarithmic expression log2(32) to a base 10 logarithm.

Using , replace the b with 10, the a with 2, and the x with 32:

You can then use a scientific calculator to get an approximation of the log of 32 and the log of 2:

This shouldn’t be too much of a surprise, since log2(32) = x is equivalent to 2x = 32 = 25.

Most of the time, the numbers don’t turn out quite as nicely, which is why calculators are so important.

Quick Math Fact

If you know that x = y and that they are positive values, then it’s also true that log x = log y and that ln x = ln y. The opposites of each are also true: if log x = log y or ln x = ln y, then x = y.

Example

Solve for x in the equation log (x + 7) = log (16).

Using that if log x = log y, then x = y, you have that x + 7 = 16. Subtracting 7 from each side of the equation, x = 9.

Quick Math Fact

A property of logarithms is that log ax = x log a. The exponent of a becomes a multiplier of the log.

Example

Rewrite the logarithmic expression log3 94 as a product.

Applying log ax = x log a, the 4 is moved in front of the log as a multiplier: log3 94 = 4 log3 9.

Example

Rewrite the logarithmic expression ln 15−2 as a product.

Applying ln ax = x ln a, you move the −2 in front of the ln as a multiplier: ln 15−2 = −2 ln 15.

In the next example, you’ll see why these last two rules are so helpful when dealing with exponential equations.

Example

Solve for x in the equation 10x = 45.

First, rewrite the equation using that if x = y, then log x = log y: 10x = 45 → log 10x = log 45.

Now use the rule log ax = x log a to move the x in front of the log 10: log 10x = log 45 → x log 10 = log 45.

To solve for x, divide each side of the equation by log 10:

Finally, using a scientific calculator: .

0.3 Statistics
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

3. Determine the measures of central tendency and spread of a data set; interpret and analyze the results of the computations.
Central Tendency
(Determine the mean, median, and mode of a data set.)

What does “average” mean? Is it the most expected value? Is it the middle value? Actually, it can be one or both of those things. In statistics, there are three traditional measures of central tendency, and each is used where it best describes what is going on in the set of numbers.

Quick Math Fact

The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers in the set divided by how many numbers there are.

Example

Find the mean of the test scores 56, 89, 78, 93, 77, 81, 81

To find the mean, add up the numbers and divide by 7, the number of scores there are:

The mean is about 79.3 or 79.

As you see, the mean isn’t any of the actual scores. But it describes, on average, what the scores are. Some are below 79.3, and some are above.

Quick Math Fact

The median of a set of numbers is the middle number in an ordered arrangement of the set. If there is no single middle number, then the median is the mean of the two numbers in the middle.

Example

Find the median of the test scores 56, 89, 78, 93, 77, 81, 81

First, put the list of scores in order: 56, 77, 78, 81, 81, 89, 93

Since there are seven numbers in the set, the middle number is the 4th in the list:

The median is 81.

Example

Find the median of the set 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10

There are 14 numbers in the list, so the 7th and 8th numbers are in the middle. The 7th and 8th numbers are both 5, so the median is also 5.

Example

Find the median of the set 100, 200, 200, 200, 300, 400, 600, 600, 600, 600

There are 10 numbers in the list, so the 5th and 6th numbers are in the middle.

The median is the mean of 300 and 400, which is 350.

So the median of the set is 350.

Quick Math Fact

The mode of a set of numbers is the number that occurs most frequently.

Example

Find the mode of the test scores 56, 77, 78, 81, 81, 89, 93

The mode is 81, because that score appears twice, and the rest each appear only once.

Example

Find the mode of the set 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8

There are two modes: 3 and 4, because they both appear four times, more than any of the other numbers.

Weighted Average
(Compute weighted averages given number sets and/or categories.)

A weighted average is a computation of the mean of a data set where some of the values have more influence (weight) than the others.

Example

On Monday, the quiz scores in a class were: 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10. On Tuesday, the quiz scores in the same class were: 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10. What was the total average of all the quizzes?

First, you note that 16 people took the quiz on Monday and only 10 took it on Tuesday. (The flu was going around.)

You can find the average for each day:

You can’t add 8.875 + 7.7 and divide by 2 when finding the mean average, because the two averages have different “weights”.

Since you know that there were a total of 26 quizzes, you can just take the two sums, add them together, and divide by 26:

You may not always have the option of adding the individual sums. Sometimes you’re given the average of one situation and another, the number of items of data, and that’s it.

Example

The average height of the 12 members of team A is 73.2 inches. The average height of the 15 members of team B is 74.4 inches. And the average height of the 9 members of team C is 77.5 inches. What is the average height of all 36 participants?

First, determine what part of the total each team represents:

You can use the fractions or their decimal equivalents. But, since two of the fractions have repeating decimals, a more accurate answer will be found using the fractions.

Multiply each fraction times its corresponding average height:

By using the original fractions, there was only one division necessary, at the end. Using the reduced fractions would have worked just fine, also.

Geometric Mean
(Calculate the geometric mean and compare to the arithmetic mean.)

There are several measures of central tendency. The most commonly used are the arithmetic mean, the median, and the mode. Each has its place in reporting characteristics of data—one giving a better measure than the others.

The geometric mean is used when comparing items that are different from one another. One item may come from a much larger range or have different weight than another. To compute the geometric mean of a set of numbers, you multiply all the numbers and then take a root of the product.

Quick Math Fact

The geometric mean of a set of n numbers is the nth root of the product of the numbers.

Example

Find the geometric mean of the numbers 1, 1, 2, 2, 8

Using the formula: geometric mean

Compare this to the arithmetic mean, median, and mode.

arithmetic mean (add the numbers together and divide by how many numbers)

median (middle number of an ordered list) = 1, 1, 2, 2, 8

The median is 2.

mode (most frequently occurring number) = 1 and 2

There are two modes.

The “averages” all come out around 2. And each has its place, depending on what is being reported.

Example

Find the geometric mean of the percentages 80%, 10%, 50%

Using the formula: geometric mean or 34.2%

Comparing this to the arithmetic mean:

Variance and Standard Deviation
(Compute and interpret the variance and standard deviation of a set of numbers.)

Measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) tell you one thing about a set of numbers. They give you an idea as to the average or most expected number. The measures of variability (range, variance, and standard deviation) tell you about the spread of the set of numbers. Are they all bunched together, or are they spread far out from the center.

The two sets of numbers below each have a mean of 50. Their “spread” is very different.

Quick Math Fact

The range of a set of numbers is the difference between the highest number and lowest number.

Example

Find the ranges of Sets A and B, above.

The range of Set A is 60 − 40 = 20.

The range of Set B is 95 − 5 = 90

Quick Math Fact

The variance of a set of numbers is the mean of the squares of the deviations of each number from the mean. Let the mean of the set of numbers be , and the variance be s2. Then the formula is:

Example

Find the variances of Sets A and B, above.

The mean of set A is 50. So the variance is:

The variance of set A is 50.

The mean of set B is also 50. And the variance is:

The variance of set B is 1450.

When one set of numbers is clustered together more tightly than another, then its variance will be a smaller number.

Quick Math Fact

The standard deviation of a set of numbers is the square root of the variance. Letting s represent the standard deviation:

Example

Find the standard deviations of Sets A and B, above.

Since the variance of set A is 50, then the standard deviation is: .

The variance of set B is 1450, so the standard deviation is: .

Example

Find the mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation of the ages of the first 45 U.S. Presidents when they were first inaugurated. The chart below gives the ages and frequencies.

The mean is the sum of the ages divided by 45:

The median is the middle age in the ordered list, so it’s the 23rd age: 55

There are two modes: 51 and 54 both occur most frequently—five times

The range is the difference between the oldest and youngest: 70 − 42 = 28 years

The variance is:

And the standard deviation is:

Were you wondering who the youngest and oldest Presidents were? The youngest was Theodore Roosevelt, and the oldest was Donald Trump.

Normal Curve
(Interpret statistical values using the curve representation of a data set.)

The normal or bell-shaped curve shows the normal distribution of a data set.

The graph below is a representation of the standard normal curve and illustrates the 68-95-99.7 rule.

The mean of the data set is 0. Between −1 and 1 standard deviation from the mean, you find 68% of the scores or data. From −2 to 2 standard deviations is 95% of the scores, and 99.7% lies between −3 and 3 standard deviations from the mean.


Example

On a recent exam, the mean score was 73, and the standard deviation was 7. The scores were normally distributed. What percent of the students scored below 80 on the exam?

Draw a normal curve showing the scores at the mean and standard deviations of ±1, ±2, ±3.


A score of 80 is 1 standard deviation above the mean. Half of the scores are below the mean, so that’s 50% of the scores. Between 66 and 80, you find 68% of the scores. But the scores from 66 to 80 have already been figured in, so just take half of the 68% or 34%. Adding 50% + 34%, you have that 84% of the students had a score below 80.

Example

A movie theatre has been keeping track of the amount of money spent on concessions. They found that on average, a person spends $6.11 on concessions. The standard deviation is $1.37, and the data is normally distributed. What percent of the customers spend more than $8.85 on concessions?

Draw a normal curve showing the spending at the mean and standard deviations of ±1, ±2, ±3.


$8.85 is 2 standard deviations above the mean. If you add the lower 50% to half of the area between −2 and +2 standard deviations, that’s 50% + 47.5% = 97.5%. But that’s the percentage of people who spend less than $8.85. To find the percentage who spend MORE than $8.85, just subtract 97.5% from 100% to get 2.5%.

Example

A website keeps track of their daily hits and have found that the number of hits is normally distributed. On average, they get 1000 hits per day, with a standard deviation of 240. If bandwidth is measured in terms of the number of hits the site can handle, then how large a bandwidth should the website have to be able to handle 97.5% of the traffic?

Referring to the normal curve, you find 95% of the area between −2 and +2 standard deviations. That leaves 5% divided between the lower end and the upper end. Add half that to the 95%, and you have 97.5% below the +2 standard deviations.

Since the mean is 1000 and 2 × 240 = 480, then 1,480 hits would be the 97.5% amount. They need a bandwidth of at least 1480.

Regression
(Examine an equation for a regression line and determine strength of the relationship.)

A regression line is a model which is used to describe the relationship between input values and output values in a data set. The relationship is shown with a figure (the data points and regression line), with a formula (the equation of a line), and with a value or “rating” of the relationship (correlation coefficient).

Example

Graph the data points in the chart showing the number of hours studied by 15 students and the score they received on the exam for which they were studying. Then draw a line through the points, getting as close as possible to as many as possible.

Hours	0	0	1	1	2	3	3	4	4	5	5	5	6	7	7	9
Score	41	35	40	48	50	60	68	60	65	72	66	75	80	84	90	93
Here’s a graph of the points and a line that’s trying to fit or describe them.


As you can see, the points don’t lie on the line. Some points are above, and some are below. You want to have the best fitting line possible—the one that has the smallest total vertical distance between the line and the points. The line chosen is called the regression line and can be used to predict more scores. Assuming that increasing the number of hours studied will increase the score, you can predict what the score would be if a person studied 10 hours or, because no one studied 8 hours, you could predict what that would produce.

Assume that the regression line above has the formula Score = 40 + 6 × h, where h is the number of hours. Using this formula, then a person studying 8 hours would expect a score of 40 + 6 × 8 = 40 + 48 = 88. This point would lie directly on the line, not above or below. But it’s just a prediction.

Example

Given the graph of the data, below, and the regression line with the equation y = 3.4x + 1, would the point (5, 17) lie above or below or on the regression line?

The best way to check to see where the point would lie is to enter x = 5 into the regression equation. This tells you the point on the line.

If y = 3.4x + 1, then, when x = 5, y = 3.4 (5) + 1 = 17 + 1 = 18. The point on the line is (5, 18), so the data point (5, 17) is below the regression line.


A least squares regression line is the line that makes the vertical distances between the data points and that line as small as possible. Each of the distances is squared when the regression coefficient is computed, because a consistent subtraction direction will make some distances positive and some distances negative—they’d cancel one another out.

Example

Graph the points (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 6), and (5, 2). Then compute the vertical distances between these points and the line with the equation y = 0.6x + 2.


The line with the equation y = 0.6x + 2 lies below some points and above others. The distances from the point vertical to a point on the line are shown. Is this the best line that could be found?

Technology is wonderful in that it allows you to determine the least squares regression line and the correlation coefficient, which is sort of a score for the line. All you have to do is put in the data points, and voila! And, just to help you appreciate it even more, the equation of the best-fit line and its correlation coefficient for the four points in the previous example will be computed, below. You can check it with your calculator.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for the best-fit regression line y = ax + b is found when:

The value of the correlation coefficient, r, is found with:

Example

Given the points (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 6), and (5, 2), find the best-fit regression line and the value of the correlation coefficient.

The formulas are full of sums of this and sums of that. It’s best to just make a quick chart and find those values before beginning.

x
y
x2
y2
xy
2	5	 4	25	10
3	3	 9	 9	 9
4	6	16	36	24
5	2	25	 4	10
Σx = 14	Σy = 16	Σx2 = 54	Σy2 = 74	Σxy = 53
First, to find the value of a, the slope of the regression line:

Now, finding the value of b, the y-intercept:

So the equation of the best-fit line is y = −0.6x + 6.1. This is NOT the line that’s shown. In fact, this best fit line is negatively sloped unlike the positively sloped line in the previous graph.

But how good a fit is this “best fit” line?

Computing the value of r:

So what does this correlation coefficient mean? The value of the correlation coefficient ranges from −1 to 1. The closer the coefficient is to 1 or, when negative the closer to −1, the better the fit. If the coefficient for a particular data set is 1, then every point is on the line. If the score is 0.7, then that’s pretty close and a relatively strong score. A score of 0.5 indicates moderate correlation. Statisticians usually like to see scores greater than 0.5 before considering the correlation to be significant.

The same goes for the negative correlations. A score of −1 means a perfect negative correlation. A score of −0.7 is strong negative, −0.5 is a moderate negative correlation. The closer to 1 or −1, the better the model is at predicting future results.

So, in the above example, the correlation of −0.4243 is not very good. There doesn’t seem to be much correlation between the input and the output. They’re “all over the place”.

Again, it is much better to take advantage of technology. Graphing and financial calculators will do these computations quickly and easily.

0.4 Fractions and Percent
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

1. Recognizing and computing the equivalent values of fractions and decimals and using the results effectively in ratios and proportions.
Fractions and Decimals
(Finding the decimal equivalent of a fraction and the fraction equivalent of a decimal.)

All fractions can be written as decimals. Many decimals can be written as fractions.

All fractions can be written as decimals.

When you are given a fraction, you can rewrite it as a decimal that either terminates (eventually comes to an end) or repeats in some pattern. The numbers in the fraction have to be integers or, at least, rational numbers, but that’s usually what you’re working with, anyway. Here are some fractions and their decimal equivalents.

0.375
0.1464
0.009
0.727272…
4.444444…
0.15666666…
Quick Math Fact

To indicate that a decimal repeats forever, in a particular pattern, either show enough of the pattern and put three decimal points at the end or draw a bar across the repeating digits.

Example

Change the fraction to a decimal.

Divide the bottom (denominator) into the top (numerator). You’ll have to insert a decimal point and add zeros until the division ends or you see a pattern.

 	0	.3	8	8
18	7	.0	0	0
 			 	 
 	1	6	0	 
 				 
 	 	1	6	0
 	 			
 	 	 	1	6
As you see, the 8 will keep repeating forever. This fraction has a repeating decimal.

Example

Change the fraction to a decimal.

Sometimes, it takes a while to find what is repeating in a decimal.

 	0	.2	3	8	0	9	5	2	3
21	5	.0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
If you do this problem with your calculator, it gets rounded off, and the pattern isn’t always apparent. But there are six digits that repeat in this fraction. You can write:

Many decimals can be written as fractions.

All decimals that repeat or terminate can be written as fractions. The decimals representing irrational numbers, such as those for: π, e, , and so on are non-repeating. They go on forever, but there’s no pattern to the digits in their representation.

It’s often helpful to change a decimal to a fraction so that it can be used in a computation or worked into a formula. There are two different cases to consider: terminating decimals and repeating decimals. And the repeating decimals are broken into two different cases, also.

Quick Math Fact

To change a terminating decimal to a fraction, put the digits in the decimal over a power of 10 that has the same number of digits as the decimal. Then reduce the fraction.

Example

Find a fraction with the same value as 0.00008

There are five digits in the decimal, so put them over the power of 10 with five zeros. You don’t need to include the 0s in front of the 8.

Quick Math Fact

To change a terminating decimal to a fraction, when all the digits repeat, put the digits in the decimal over as many 9s as there are repeating digits. Then reduce the fraction.

Example

Find a fraction with the same value as 0.123123123…

There are three digits that repeat. Put 123 in the numerator of a fraction with a denominator of 999.

If a decimal number starts out with some digits that aren’t included in the repeating part, then it takes a little more work to find the equivalent fraction. You have to do a subtraction of two multiples of the original decimal, and then solve an equation. It’s easier to just to show the technique to use with the following example.

Example

Find a fraction with the same value as 0.5833333…

As you see, the 3 is repeating forever. But the 0.58 has to be accounted for, also. The goal is to move the 58 to the left of the decimal point.

First, let N = 0.5833333…

Now multiply N by 100 to get: 100N = 58.33333…

Do another multiplication: 1000N = 583.33333….

Now subtract 1000N − 100 N:

Now solve for N by dividing 525 by 900:

Example

How many degrees are in the sector of a pie graph that is used to indicate 75% of a circle?


Quick Math Fact

A pie graph is a circle. A circle measures 360 degrees. A sector is a section of a circle defined by two radii.

To find the number of degrees, you can either multiply 360 by the decimal equivalent of 75% or the fraction equivalent. You will see the fraction used here.

The percentage 75% is equivalent to 0.75 or . This fraction reduces to .

Use the reduced form to multiply 360:

There are 270 degrees in a sector covering 75% of the circle.

Using Ratio and Percent
(Making use of ratio and percent formats to communicate information clearly.)

A ratio is a comparison of two values. It can be written as a fraction, with a colon, or with words. For example, can be written as 3:4 or as “3 to 4”. You can use ratios when comparing like-values.

Example

Consider the pie chart illustrating the distribution of 100 farm animals owned by Old MacDonald.


What is the ratio of pigs to sheep?

The ratio of pigs to sheep is 20 to 25. This is also written 20:25 or . Since the fraction can be reduced, you can also say that the ratio of the pigs to sheep is or the ratio is 4 to 5. This means that for every 4 pigs on the farm there are 5 sheep.

But you can also turn it around and ask for the ratio of sheep to pigs. The number of sheep to pigs is 25 to 20. Look somewhat familiar? Yes, this is also 25:20 and . There are 5 sheep for every 4 pigs.

It’s important, when using ratios, that you specify how—in which order—the values are being compared.

A percent is just a very special fraction. It’s a fraction whose denominator (bottom) is always 100. If you go back to Old MacDonald, you see that 25 out of his 100 animals are sheep. So or 25% are sheep. If you prefer fractions, then you can say that are sheep, but that’s still 25%.

Example

Change the fraction to a percent by finding an equivalent fraction.

First find an equivalent fraction whose denominator is 100. You can do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator (top and bottom) by 2.

The fraction is equal to 70%.

Another way to do this problem is to change the fraction to a decimal.

Quick Math Fact

To change a decimal to a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right. To change a percent to a decimal, move the decimal point two places to the left.

Example

Change the fraction to a percent by finding the decimal equivalent of the fraction.

First change the fraction to a decimal by dividing the denominator (bottom) into the numerator.

 	0.7
50	35.0
To change the number 0.7 to a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right. You’ll need to add a 0 after the 7.

Example

Your total spendable budget after taxes is $147,400. What percent of your budget are you using for entertainment, if your current amount is $22,440?

Before doing any dividing or fraction-changing, reduce the fraction formed by putting the entertainment amount in the numerator and total amount in the denominator of a fraction:

(The reductions were: dividing by 10, 11, and 4, respectively.)

It doesn’t look like there will be any nice way to change the fraction to an equivalent version with a denominator of 100, so divide 51 by 335:

Rounding to the ten-thousandths place and then moving the decimal point two places to the right, gives you:

Is this a lot for entertainment, or not?

Fractions, Decimals and Rounding
(Round numbers specified places.)

All fractions can be written as decimals. Many decimals can be written as fractions. And all decimals can be rounded to a chosen number of digits.

Quick Math Fact

The names of some place values of decimal numbers are shown below.


All decimals can be rounded to a chosen number of digits.

Fractions are exact. Decimals can be exact if they terminate. Repeating decimals often need to be rounded, if you want to use them in a problem or answer.

Rounding numbers means to use an estimate of the exact number. When rounding decimals, you choose how many digits you want to the right of the decimal point and then either drop off the extras (those to the right of the chosen value) or increase the last digit by one. How do you decide whether to just lop them off or round up? The deciding number is 5.

Quick Math Fact

When rounding a decimal, underline the last digit to be used. If the next digit to the right of the underlined digit is four or smaller, then leave the underlined digit alone. If the digit to the right is five or greater, then increase the underlined digit by one.

Example

Round the decimal 0.3333333… to the nearest thousandth.

The thousandth place is the third digit to the right of the decimal point: 0.3333333…

Since the next digit to the right is 3, which is smaller than five, just drop the rest of the digits.

So you can say that: 0.333 ≈ 0.333333…

The rounded version is “approximately” the exact version.

Example

Round the decimal 0.4135728 to the nearest millionth.

First underline the digit in the millionth place: 0.4135728

The digit to the right of the millionth place is 8, which is greater than five. So increase the 2 to 3 and drop the 8.

So 0.413573 ≈ .4135728

Financial institutions don’t round up when figuring out how much interest to pay you. They always round down, which means you “lose” a fraction of a cent, if the interest doesn’t come out even.

Example

How much money do you lose if your interest payment of $140.36983444444… is rounded down instead of up?

Rounding $140.36983444444… to the nearest penny gives you $140.37. Rounding down, instead of using the mathematical rule, gives you $140.36. You don’t really lose a penny, because you didn’t earn that much interest. You lose the difference between $140.36983444444… and $140.36 which is $0.00983444444… This is less than a penny, but they do add up when repeated enough times!

0.5 Interest and Dividend Payments
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

5. Computing amounts of interest and the rates needed to produce desired future values.
Determining Earnings from Interest
(Use appropriate formulas to compute interest on investments.)

The interest on an investment is the amount that the institution pays you for the privilege of holding and using your money. Interest can be paid yearly, monthly, daily, and so on. And interest rates vary greatly.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for simple interest is: I = Prt, where I is the amount of interest paid, P is the principal, or beginning amount, r is the rate of interest as a decimal, and t is the time in years.

Example

Find the amount of interest earned on $10,000 invested at 4% interest for 6 years.

Using the formula: I = 10,000 × 0.04 × 6 = $2,400.

Quick Math Fact

The formula A = P(1 + rt) gives you the total in your account, the original amount plus interest, where A is the total, P is the principal, or beginning amount, r is the rate of interest as a decimal, and t is the time in years.

Example

What is the total amount in an account earning 4.5% interest for 10 years when the original amount deposited was $12,000?

Using the formula: A = 12,000 (1 + 0.045 × 10) = 12,000 (1 + 0.45) = 12,000 (1.45) = $17,400.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for compound interest is: , where A is the total amount in the account, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest as a decimal, m is the number of times each year that the interest is compounded, and t is the time in years.

Example

Find the total amount in an account that started with $10,000 and earned interest of 3% compounded quarterly for 20 years.

Using the formula, you have: .

Using the order of operations, you first divide in the parentheses, then add the result to 1. Next, raise the sum from the parentheses to the 80th power (because you multiply those two numbers in the exponent, first). Finally, you multiply by the number in front.

The amount in the account is $18,180.44 after 20 years.

Compounding can happen yearly, monthly (twelve times per year), quarterly (four times each year), daily (365 times each year), and continuously. That means the interest is compounding an infinite number of times. How can that be? Well, it’s not practically possible, but, as you increase the number of times the interest is compounded, the amount of interest changes less and less. The formula for compounding continuously is just very handy to use. The value of e is a decimal that goes on forever, also, but you can use: 2.71828.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for compounding continuously is: A = Pert, where A is the total amount in the account, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest as a decimal, and t is the time in years.

Example

Find the total amount in an account that started with $10,000 ten years ago and has been earning interest at the rate of 5% compounded continuously.

Using the formula:

The total is $16,487.21.

Effective Interest Rates
(Determining the effects of compounding.)

When you walk into the bank, you see that the interest rate is 3%, but that the effective interest rate is 3.0334%—just a bit higher than the quoted rate of 3%. The effective rate gives you the result of compounding.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for the effective annual interest rate is: , where m is the number of times each year that the interest is compounded.

Example

Determine the effective annual interest rate when the quoted rate is 5.2% and the compounding is done quarterly, monthly, and daily.

Number of Times each Year	Formula	Effective Rate
  4		 5.3023%
 12		 5.3257%
365		5.33718%
As you can see, the number of times doesn’t affect the effective rate all that much. But over time those small differences do add up.

0.6 Probability
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

6. Understand the rules and properties of probability and probability distributions in their applications to life situations.
Probability Distributions
(Create probability distributions to determine the likelihood of particular events.)

A probability distribution is a rule or function that provides the probability of each of the possible occurrences in a situation or experiment. The sum of all the probabilities possible is always equal to 1.

Example

When flipping a coin twice, what is the probability of both results being “heads”?

The probability distribution includes all possibilities and the probability of each.

First, the four possibilities: HH, HT, TH, TT

Number of Heads
 
Probability
2
HH
1
HT, TH
0
TT
Only one of the four different results is that both are heads, so the probability of both heads is or 25%.

Example

A television program wants to feature a family with four children. If such a family is chosen at random from all those that apply, what is the probability that the family will have 3 boys and 1 girl?

First, list all the possibilities. Since, at each birth, there are two possibilities (boy or girl), then there will be 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 = 16 different arrangements possible. They are:

BBBB	BBBG	BBGB	BBGG
BGBB	BGBG	BGGB	BGGG
GBBB	GBBG	GBGB	GBGG
GGBB	GGBG	GGGB	GGGG
Next, a table with the number of boys and the probability of each:

Number of Boys

BBBB, BBBG, BGBB, GBBB
2
BBGG, BGBG, BGGB, GBBG, GBGB, GGBB
1
BGGG, GBGG, GGBG, GGGB
0
GGGG
The probability that the family will have 3 boys and 1 girl is ¼ or 25%.

Example

In May of last year, the probability that the Cardinals would beat the Cubs was 60%. In a three-game series, what is the probability that the Cardinals will win exactly one game, exactly two games, and at least two games?

To determine the probabilities of the Cardinals winning three, two, one or no games, consider the probability tree shown here. The probability 0.6 indicates a win for the Cardinals. Multiplying the probability of the three games together gives the final probability of the three results all occurring.


First, note that all the final probabilities add up to 1: 0.216 + 0.144 + 0.144 + 0.096 + 0.144 + 0.096 + 0.096 + 0.064 = 1.

What is the probability that the Cardinals will win exactly one game?

Look at the fourth, sixth, and seventh entries on the right side of the tree. Add them together:

What is the probability that the Cardinals will win exactly two games?

Look at the second, third, and fifth entries. Adding:

And, finally, what is the probability that the Cardinals will win at least two games?

Winning at least two means winning either two or three, so add the probability of winning exactly two to the probability of winning exactly three:

Counting Techniques
(Use the multiplication principle, permutations, and combinations to count the number of ways to do a task.)

“Let me count the ways.” Elizabeth Barrett Browning probably didn’t intend that any mathematical procedures be used, but her poem does bring up the question, “How do I count them?”

If you were told to count how many whole numbers there are from 1 through 100, you would quickly come up with the answer: 100. Easy. But how many whole numbers are there from 27 through 58? Do you subtract? Then 58 − 27 = 31, which is wrong. If you had subtracted 100 − 1 = 99 to answer the first query, then you would have quickly spotted that you have to add 1 more to include both ends of the list of numbers. So the answer to how many from 27 through 58 is that there are 32 numbers.

See, counting numbers isn’t always that clear-cut or easy. And sometimes it can get complicated, if you don’t want to list all the numbers or items you’re considering. That’s why some nice counting techniques are often used.

Quick Math Fact

The multiplication property of counting says that if you have n1 ways to do choice 1, and n2 ways to do choice 2, and n3 ways to do choice 3, and n4 ways to do choice 4, and so on and so on… then, to do one of each:

Example

You can build your own pizza by choosing one meat, one vegetable, one type of cheese, one sauce, and one type of crust. There are 3 meat choices (sausage, pepperoni, ham), 4 vegetable choices (onion, green pepper, yellow pepper, hot pepper), 3 cheese choices (mozzarella, Swiss, colby), 4 sauces (mild tomato, spicy tomato, very spicy tomato, Alfredo), and 2 crust choices (thin, regular). How many different pizzas can be built?

You could start listing the pizza possibilities: (1) sausage, onion, mozzarella, mild tomato, thin crust; (2) sausage, green pepper, Swiss, mild tomato, regular crust; (3)… You get the picture.

If you just need to know how many different pizzas are possible, use the multiplication property:

Doesn’t make much sense to create a sample of each type for display.

Example

You plan to visit all 50 states during the next few years. You want to make a list of the states in the order that you’ll be visiting them. How many different orders are there for visiting the 50 states?

Using the multiplication property, you identify how many ways you can visit the first state, then how many ways to visit the second state, etc.

There are 50 ways to visit the first. Then, with the first state eliminated, there are 49 to visit the second. You have 48 choices for the third state, etc.

So, using the multiplication property, the number of possible choices would look like:

Oops. Too big to give the exact answer. There would be over 3 × 1064 ways (that’s a 3 followed by 64 zeros).

Now consider a possible situation when playing a word game. You have five letters remaining and want to play three of them in a quadruple-score zone. The letters you have are: A E H M S. How many three-letter words are possible? You see HAM, SHE, ASH, EMS, but have you missed any? There’s a formula that can help you determine how many “words” there are (how many, but not what they are).

Quick Math Fact

The number of permutations of n different items taken k at a time is found with:

In case you need a reminder, n! = n(n − 1)(n − 2)(n − 3) ⋯ 3 · 2 · 1

If you are determining the number of permutations of n objects, when you are taking some or all of them at a time, you care about the order. “Order matters.”

Example

How many different permutations are there of the five letters A E H M S when you choose three of them at a time?

Using the formula for permutations:

Now that you know how many, you can be sure if you’ve tried all the possibilities.

Just for fun, here are the 60 possibilities:

AEH	AEM	AES	AHM	AHS	AMS	EHM	EHS	EMS	HMS
AHE	AME	ASE	AMH	ASH	ASM	EMH	ESH	ESM	HSM
EAH	EAM	EAS	HAM	HAS	MAS	HEM	HES	MES	MHS
EHA	EMA	ESA	HMA	HSA	MSA	HME	HSE	MSE	MSH
HAE	MAE	SAE	MAH	SAH	SAM	MEH	SEH	SEM	SHM
HEA	MEA	SEA	MHA	SHA	SMA	MHE	SHE	SME	SMH
As you see, there aren’t too many actual “words” to choose from for the next play. Just arranging the letters doesn’t necessarily produce a real word.

Example

A raffle is being held where the three prizes are: a car, a television, and a fancy dinner. If 1000 tickets were sold, and the tickets will be drawn by machine with the first ticket winning the car, the second the television, and the third the dinner, then how many different ways can 3 of the 1000 tickets be drawn?

Using the formula for permutations:

That’s almost a billion different ways that the three prizes can be awarded to 3 out of the 1000 contestants.

In the last three examples, you see that the order matters. If you’re one of the three prize winners, you want to be the one who gets the car—not the dinner. But many times you need to count how many ways to do something where the order doesn’t really matter. When that’s the situation, you need the formula for the number of combinations.

Quick Math Fact

The number of combinations of n different items taken k at a time is found with:

This formula looks very much like the one for permutations with the difference that there’s another factor in the denominator. This extra factor makes the resulting answer smaller. If the order doesn’t matter, then you don’t have to worry about how many ways to arrange the choices.

Example

There are twenty people in your club, and you need a committee of three to make plans for a party. How many different ways can three people be selected?

Using the formula for combinations:

So there are 1,140 different committees that can be selected.

Example

You have money to invest in stocks. Your broker suggests picking any 4 of the 7 choices she has made, and invest an equal amount in each. How many ways can you choose the 4 stocks?

Since the order of the choices doesn’t matter, use the formula for combinations:

So there are 35 different ways to choose the 4 stocks.

Basic Probability Rules
(Apply rules of probability to determine the chance of a situation occurring.)

What is the probability that it will rain tomorrow? Thank goodness we aren’t going to deal with that type of problem! We’ll stick to things that are still “chancy” but with more to base our predictions on for an answer.

The probability of something occurring is the likelihood or chance that it will occur—in terms of a number. The probability of an event always ranges between 0% and 100% (from impossible to for-sure). The most general formula for finding the probability of an event involves dividing one number by another number.

Quick Math Fact

The probability of an event, P(E), occurring is found with:

Example

If there are 20 M & M’s in a jar, 6 yellow, 7 red, and 7 blue, then what is the probability that you grab a yellow M & M if you reach in with your eyes closed and choose one?

There are 6 yellow M & M’s in the “desired” category. And there are a total of 20 candies. Using the formula:

There’s only a 30% chance that you’ll snag a yellow candy.

Example

You shuffle a standard deck of cards and then take the top card, without peeking to see what it is. What is the probability that the card you chose is an ace?

There are 4 aces in a standard deck of 52 cards. Using the formula:

Example

You are one of 40 astronauts training to go to Mars. Since all are equally qualified, the 5 astronauts who will go on the first flight will have their names drawn from a helmet. The first name drawn will get to be captain, and the other four will have equal flight-supervisory roles. What is the probability that you will get to go—in any position? And what is the probability that you will get to go as captain?

First, to determine the probability that you’ll be included in the flight, figure out how many different groups of five can be selected from the 40 astronauts. Order doesn’t matter. Using the formula for the number of combinations of 5 that can be selected from 40:

So there are 658,008 different groups of 5 that can be selected.

How many of those groups will include you? To determine this, figure that your name is drawn and then four more—again, order doesn’t matter. So find the number of combinations of 4 more astronauts can be chosen from the remaining 39:

There are 82,251 groups of five that include you!

The probability that you’ll be in the group of five that gets to go:

Wow!

To figure the chance that you’ll be captain is much easier. The captain is the first name drawn. So you have one chance out of 40:

Of course, if you want to figure the chance that you’re captain if you already know you’re going (this is conditional probability), then that’s 1 in 5 or .

Conditional probability is a situation where the numbers change based on additional information or on some previous activity. It’s the probability of an event if another event has occurred.

Example

There are 16 marbles in a bag. 9 are blue and 7 are red. What is the probability of reaching in and drawing two red marbles?

Consider the two drawings as two different events. You want to draw a red marble AND you want to draw another red marble.

The first draw: there are 7 red marbles in the bag of 16:

The second draw: there are 6 red marbles left in the bag of 15:

You want to perform the first AND the second, so you multiply the probabilities together:

Example

You have two buckets. The first bucket has two red golf balls and three white golf balls. The second bucket has three red golf balls and seven white golf balls. You flip a coin to choose a bucket at random and, with eyes closed, pick out a golf ball. What is the probability that you select a red golf ball?

Before doing the math, take a look at a tree diagram that illustrates the possibilities.


You see that:

If you pick the first bucket, you have a 40% chance of choosing a red golf ball. You multiply the probability of choosing that bucket with the probability of drawing a red ball, and your chance is 20%.
If you pick the second bucket, you have a 30% chance of choosing a red golf ball. You multiply the probability of choosing that bucket with the probability of drawing a red ball, and your chance is 15%.
So, adding the two values together, you have a 35% chance of drawing a red golf ball. You can’t just add the number of balls together. A total of 5 out of the 15 golf balls is red—which is . But this doesn’t factor in the different number of choices in each bucket.

Venn Diagrams
(Construct and interpret a Venn diagram to illustrate and solve a probability problem.)

A Venn diagram is a sketch that shows all the possible relationships between a collection of items from different sets. It illustrates the items shared by more than one of the sets and acts as a useful organizational and counting tool.

Example

A group of 30 people is polled about television shows. If 13 people like Dancing with the Stars, 15 people like Big Bang Theory, and 12 people like both of those shows, then what percent of those polled don’t like either of them?

Draw a Venn Diagram with two circles: one for those who like Dancing and one for those who like Theory. Have the circles overlap for those who like both.


The circle on the left has to contain a total of 13, and the circle on the right has to contain a total of 15. Their intersection has to contain 12. So that leaves 13 − 12 = 1 for the left part of the left circle and it leaves 15 − 12 = 3 for the right part of the right circle.


You see a total of 16 people accounted for. Since 30 people were polled, then 30 − 16 = 14 of them don’t like either show.


So or over 46% of those polled don’t like either program.

Example

Ted has 60 active clients who he is inviting in for consultations. 39 of them own stocks, 44 own bonds, and 44 of them are in the money market. Of those, 28 own both stocks and bonds, 33 own bonds and are in the money market, and 14 own stocks and are in the money market. Also, 24 are in all three. What percentage of his clients own stocks only?

Draw a Venn diagram with three circles. Have them all overlap.


Put the number 24 in the middle circle to represent those who are in all three.


Since 28 own both stocks and bonds, then subtract 24 of them to get 28 − 24 = 4 who own just stocks and bonds but no money market.

Since 33 own both bonds and are in the money market, then subtract 24 of them to get 33 − 24 = 9 who own just bonds and are in the money market but don’t have stocks.

Since 32 own both stocks and are in the money market, then subtract 24 of them to get 32 − 24 = 8 who own just stocks and are in the money market but don’t have bonds.


A total of 39 own stocks, so 39 − (4 + 8 + 24) = 3 who own stocks only.

A total of 44 own bonds, so 44 − (4 + 9 + 24) = 7 who own bonds only.

A total of 44 are in the money market, so 44 − (8 + 9 + 24) = 3 who are in the money market only.


All the numbers in the Venn diagram so far add up to 58. So that means 2 clients are not in any of these.


Three of the clients own stocks only, so that’s .

0.7 Graphs
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

7. Create various types of graphs of functions and data, and interpret the significance of various characteristics displayed by the graphs.
Histograms and Bar Graphs
(Construct histograms and bar graphs to represent data and interpret the resulting figure.)

A histogram is a type of bar graph. A histogram is an estimate of a probability distribution, representing all of the data proportionately. The widths and heights of a histogram represent areas that total 100% of a distribution.

A bar graph consists of vertical or horizontal bars that shows comparisons of categories they represent.

Example

You buy a bag of M&M’s and count the number of each color candy in the bag (before eating it). Use the bar graph to determine how many M&M’s were in the bag, and what percentage of them were red.


The total number of M&M’s is 30 + 15 + 40 + 20 + 35 + 25 = 165.

To find the percentage that are red, divide 30 by 165:

Notice other things you can quickly identify from the bar graph: the green M&M’s are the most frequent, and the blue ones are the least.

Example

Make a bar graph of the following results of a poll involving a favorite movie.

Gone with the Wind:	14
Jaws:	11
Star Wars:	23
Pink Panther:	9
A bar graph with horizontal bars works well with this topic.


Example

Consider the bar graph below. The profits in 2005 are lower than the other years, and what else can be determined from the graph about 2005?


In 2005, the total revenues are lower than the past years, and the expenses are higher—close to the amount of revenue.

Example

Create a histogram of the number of letters in the names of the States in the U.S. The number of letters: 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13

Create bars with length corresponding to the frequency of each number of letters: 3 units for 4 letters, 3 units for 5 letters, 5 units for 6 letters, etc.


Pie Charts
(Interpret pie charts illustrating the division of assets and construct a usable pie chart from data.)

A pie chart is named so because that’s exactly what you see: a round pie-shaped figure with various “slices” indicated. Unlike an apple pie, where you try to cut the slices evenly to be fair to everyone, a pie chart is more often divided unequally to illustrate how a particular quantity is separated into different categories.

Example

What percentage of the expenses is spent on travel?


First, find the total: $33,330 + $16,670 + $12,500 + $12,500 + $25,000 = $100,000

To find the percentage spent on travel, divide $25,000 by the total, $100,000.

The decimal 0.25 is equal to 25%.

Example

Create a pie chart to illustrate the break-down of schooling for people 25 years old and over.

No high school degree − 17%
High school only − 32%
Some college − 28%
4 or more years of college − 23%
A pie chart is a circle, and a circle measures 360 degrees. Determine the number of degrees for each section:

No high school degree	17% → 0.17 × 360 = 61.2
High school only	32% → 0.32 × 360 = 115.2
Some college	28% → 0.28 × 360 = 100.8
4 or more years of college	23% → 0.23 × 360 = 82.8
Create a pie chart with the number of degrees assigned to each section.


Box-and-Whisker Plots
(Interpret and construct a box-and-whisker plot to represent a data set.)

A box-and-whisker plot is called that because you may think that you see the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland as you observe the graph.


When a box-and-whisker plot is displayed on a number line, you interpret the positions as follows:


The lowest value and highest value are the two extremes in the data in an ordered list. The lower quartile, Q1, is the median (middle) of the numbers to the left of the overall median. And the upper quartile, Q3, is the median of the numbers to the right of the overall median.

Example

Find the minimum, maximum, lower and upper quartiles, and median of the test scores, using the box-and-whisker plot.


The minimum or lowest score is 60, and the maximum or highest score is 96. The median score is 83. The lower quartile is 68, and the upper quartile is 92.

Example

Create a box-and-whisker plot using the given data.

The median (middle) score is 9, the lower quartile (middle of the numbers to the left of 9) is 8, and the upper quartile (middle of the numbers to the right of 9) is 11.

Putting these in a box-and-whisker plot:


Stem and Leaf
(Reading, interpreting, and creating stemplots to illustrate sets of data.)

A stemplot is an organized illustration of a set of data in which all but the last digit of each number in the set is listed, in numerical order, on the left side of a vertical line and all the final digits of numbers with those left-side beginnings are on the right side of the vertical line. An example will help make this more clear.

Example

Twenty students take an exam, and their scores are shown in the stemplot below. Make a list of the scores.

10	0
9	1 1 4
8	0 1 5 6 8 8
7	6 6 7 7 7 9
6	3 8
5	
4	3 7
The scores range from 100 down to 43. You read the digit(s) to the left of the line and then, one-at-a-time, pair them with the digits on the right. The scores are: 100, 91, 91, 94, 80, 81, 85, 86, 88, 88, 76, 76, 77, 77, 77, 79, 63, 68, 43, 47.

This type plot helps to organize the scores and also give you a good feel for the average and the range of scores.

Example

Make a stemplot of the 36 IQ test scores: 90, 125, 100, 116, 93, 106, 95, 112, 104, 101, 81, 116, 95, 110, 93, 127, 105, 105, 110, 113, 96, 99, 78, 124, 111, 105, 101, 118, 93, 105, 90, 103, 97, 86, 75, 102. What is the most frequently occurring score? Which is the middle score? What is the range of scores?

The most frequently occurring score is 105. The middle score is also 105. With 36 scores, the “middle” lies between the 18th and 19th scores, but both of those are 105, so that qualifies as the “middle”. The range of scores is the difference between 127 and 75 which is 52.

Area Under a Curve
(Determine the area between a curve and the horizontal axis and interpret its meaning.)

Area is a two-dimensional measure. You think of how many squares you can fit in an object and then give the measure of that object in terms of its area. The following are some area formulas that should be helpful.

Quick math facts:


Example

Find the area of the shaded region.


There are two ways to approach finding the area.

You can find the area of the rectangle to the left and the area of the triangle to the right and add the two together.

You can find the area of the trapezoid.

Example

Determine the total amount of revenue earned by selling the number of items at the prices indicated.


The different areas show:

The normal or bell-shaped curve shows the normal distribution of a data set. The total area under the curve is 1 square unit, representing all of the data.

The graph below is a representation of the normal curve and illustrates the 68-95-99.7 rule.


Example

Using the normal curve and its percentages, find the area under the curve between x = −1 and x = 1.

The area between x = −1 and x = 1 is 68%.

Example

Using the normal curve and its percentages, find the area under the curve between x = −2 and x = 0.

The area between x = −2 and x = 0 is half the area between x = −2 and x = 2, so it’s 47.5%.

Example

Using the normal curve and its percentages, find the area under the curve between x = 1 and x = 2.

If you subtract the area between −1 to 1 from the area between −2 and 2, you get 95 − 68 = 27%. Half of 27% is 13.5%.

Example

Using the normal curve and its percentages, find the combined areas under the curve that are greater than 3 and less than −3.

Subtract the area between −3 and 3, 99.7% from 100% and you get 0.03%.

Slope
(Computing and interpreting the slope of a line or slope at a point.)

When graphing lines on the coordinate plane, one of the characteristics of the line is its slope. The word slope is pretty descriptive, especially when you think of the ski slope and the difference between the “bunny slope” and the more serious slalom run. The bunny slope would have a smaller numerical designation than the slalom, in terms of steepness.

In mathematics, slope is also referred to as “rise over run” and “rate of change”.

Quick Math Fact

To compute the value of the slope of a line when you have the coordinates of two points on the line, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), use the formula .

Example

Find the slope of the line that contains the points (4, −3) and (0, 6).

Using the slope formula, insert the coordinates: .

The coordinates of the points can be reversed, but be sure that the coordinates of a point are always above and below one another and that the y-coordinates are on the top.

Here’s the computation with the coordinates reversed:

Example

Sketch the graph of the line y = −3x + 5 and determine its slope using “rise over run”.

Two points that can be used to sketch the graph of the line are (0, 5) and (3, −4). (There are many more choices, and all of them will give you the same line.)

The sketch of the line:


Now draw a horizontal line through (0, 5) and a vertical line through (3, −4).


Measure the lengths of the segments from the point of intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines to the named points.


Using “rise over run”, the slope formula now reads: .

First determine the “run”. Start with the left-most point, (0, 5), and move to the intersection. The “run” is 3 units.

Then, continuing from the point of intersection, move to the second point. The “rise” in this case is really a “fall”. The second point is 9 units down from the first, so the “rise/fall” is −9.

The slope of the line is −3.

You may have already determined this from the equation of the line. The line y = −3x + 5 is in slope-intercept form.

Quick Math Fact

A line in the slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, has a slope of m and a y-intercept of b.

Example

Find the rate of change of quantity to days from the 60th to the 80th day of production.


First, determine the approximate coordinates of the points when the number of days is 60 and 80. Indicate the points on the graph.


The curve between the two points isn’t a straight line, but it’s close enough to use the slope formula. Finding the rate of change of price to days:

The price increased approximately $2.25 per day between the 60th and 80th days.

There are two slopes that can be considered “special”. Those two are the slopes of horizontal and vertical lines.

First, consider the horizontal line going through the y-axis at (0, 2) and the point (4, 2). Computing its slope:


Quick Math Fact

The slope of any horizontal line is 0.

Next, computing the slope of the vertical line through the x-axis at (3, 0) and the point (3, 4):

You can’t divide by 0. This is “undefined”.

Quick Math Fact

The slope of any vertical line is undefined.

Intersection of Lines and Curves
(Determine coordinates of intersecting lines and curves and interpret their importance.)

The graphs of functions and other curves are usually found on a coordinate plane—a two-dimensional surface with perpendicular axes indicating the scales. Look at the examples of coordinate planes, below.


When graphing information, you often have two different lines or curves on the same graph. And an important thing to find in the graph of two different curves is the intersection, or where the curves cross. If you have equations or formulas for the curves, then you can use algebraic techniques to try to solve for their common points. If no equations are given, then you can estimate using the coordinates given on the axes.

Example

Find the point of intersection of the line y = 3x + 2 and the line y = 8 − 3x.

One approach to use is to graph the two lines.

The first line, y = 3x + 2 has a y-intercept of (0, 2). You find this by letting the x = 0 and solving for y: y = 3 (0) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2. Another point on the line is (2, 8). Again, let x = 2 and solve for y. Placing the two points in a graph and drawing a line through them, you get the following:


The second line, y = 8 − 3x contains the two points (0, 8) and (2, 2). Place the two points on the graph and draw the line through them.


Now you use the graph to determine the point of intersection.


The intersection appears to be at the point (1, 5).

A second approach to solving this problem is to set the two equations equal to one another. Since the equations are each in the form y = , you can equate what they’re equal to: 3x + 2 = 8 − 3x.

Solving for x, you add 3x to each side: 3x + 3x + 2 = 8 − 3x + 3x which is equivalent to 6x + 2 = 8.

Now subtract 2 from each side: 6x + 2 − 2 = 8 − 2 which is equivalent to 6x = 6.

Dividing each side by 6, you get x = 1.

Substitute 1 in for x in the first equation, and you have y = 3 (1) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

The point of intersection is when x = 1 and y = 5 or (1, 5).

Example

Approximate the points of intersection of the two curves.


You don’t have the equations, so you estimate from the graph.


The intersections appear to be at approximately (4.9, 6.5) and (16.7, 0.6).

Example

Find the points where the profit amounts change from negative to positive and then from positive to negative.


Just looking at the graph, you can see that the profit curve crossed the x-axis to the right of the y-axis and then dips below the x-axis again to the right of the 500-mark. It would be very difficult to make a reasonable guess as to the exact values, so the profit equation is given here: P(x) = −0.15 (x2 − 700x + 60,000), where P is the profit in dollars and x is the number of units produced.

To find where the curve changes from positive to negative or negative to positive, you determine where the profit is equal to 0: the dividing point between positive and negative. Set P(x) = 0 and you have 0 = −0.15 (x2 − 700x + 60,000). The quadratic in the parentheses factors, so the equation is now 0 = −0.15 (x − 100)(x − 600). This equation is equal to 0 when x = 100 and when x = 600. So the two places of sign change are at (100, 0) and (600, 0).

Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium Point
(Construct a graph involving supply and demand; then interpret the results.)

Supply and demand is a well-known economic model used in price determination in a competitive market. The intersection of the supply and demand curves or functions is known as the equilibrium point or where you have market equilibrium. The prices of the items being sold are placed on the vertical axis, and the number or quantity of the items is shown on the horizontal axis.

Example

What is the equilibrium point in the supply/demand graph below?


The company producing the product will supply 0 units if the price is only $7 and will be happy to produce 2500 units if the price is $32 per unit. But it’s predicted that consumers would only buy 300 units if the price is $32. The equilibrium price is found at the intersection of the two lines: (14, 21). If the price is $21, then the supplier will produce 1,400 units and the consumers will buy all those units—nothing left over and no one left unserved.

Example

Two different companies, A and B, are competing for a contract to be the supplier of a particular product. Which equilibrium point is most beneficial to the consumer company?

Supplier A will produce 15,000 units if the price is $13 per unit. Supplier B will produce 14,000 units if the price is $14 per unit. If the number of units isn’t critical, then Supplier A “wins” with a total cost of $195,000 compared to Supplier B’s total cost of $196,000 for fewer units.


Piecewise Functions
(Interpret information from graphs and function rules of piecewise functions.)

A piecewise function is a rule that changes depending on the input values. You use one version for smaller input values and another for larger input values and maybe even a third, fourth, and fifth rule, and so on. One of the best examples of a piecewise function is what you pay for cell phone usage.

Consider the company that offers you the following:

For 0 − 1000 minutes, you pay 0.016 cents per minute
For more than 1000 minutes, you pay $16 plus 0.0012 cents per minute for every minute more than 1000.
The graph of this plan is shown below.


A possible formula for this function is:

where m is the number of minutes.

As you see, a piecewise function is not usually smooth. It can make abrupt jumps and turns.

Example

Use the 2017 Federal Income Tax rates for a single person to construct a graph illustrating the function. The function T(d) gives the amount of tax owed if the taxable income is d dollars.

Using the function and finding the corresponding values, you see that the steepness changes, corresponding to the increased percentages. What is also illustrated is the interesting phenomenon between $200,000 income and $450,000. There’s a long interval for one rule and then a very short one for the next. Wonder why?


Example

Write a rule for the piecewise function shown below.


The first part of the function goes from the point (0, 9) to the point (3, 6). This is a piece of the line that has a y-intercept of 9 and a slope of −1. The slope is determined by observing the “run” of 3 units and the “rise/drop” of 3 units. The equation of such a line, in slope-intercept form, is y = −1x + 9 or y = −x + 9.

The middle part of the function is a piece of the horizontal line y = 6.

And the right-most part of the function is a piece of a line that has a slope of . You can determine this by observing that for a “run” of 3 units, the segment has a “rise” of 1 unit. To find the y-intercept, just do some back-tracking. From the point (8, 6), move 2 units back and 1 unit down to the point (6, 5). Move another 2 units back and 1 unit down to get to (4, 3). Then repeat twice more and you end up at (0, 2), the y-intercept. With the three lines identified, the rule can be written:

You notice that either the first or second rule can be used when x = 3 and that either the second or third rule can be used when x = 8. This occurs when one part of the graph picks up where the last one left off. This isn’t always the case. There can be gaps in the graph—and in the function values.

Logistics Function
(Become familiar with the logistics curve and interpret the characteristics shown.)

A logistics function has a graph that is a gentle curve, moving upward or downward, with a change in concavity somewhere in the middle. Here are two general examples of logistics curves.


These curves may not seem very exciting to you, but they are very important in terms of describing growth in populations, medical situations, sales, etc.

The three quickest things to learn from the graph of a logistics curve are its maximum value, minimum value, and turning point (where progress or change slows down). Look at the two graphs again.


There’s an “urban legend” going around that Sam Walton (of Wal-Mart fame) made his money by determining when a new product started being bought by consumers at a decreasing rate. He had the inventory of that product reported every night so he could determine when the slow-down began. Then he would cut back on the purchasing of that product and, consequently, not have a surplus of inventory that would have to be sold at a reduced price. The logistics curve is a representation of how this can be tracked.

Quick Math Fact

A general form for the equation of a logistics curve is where L is the maximum value (limiting factor), e is the Euler number (about 2.71828), and k affects the steepness (like slope). The turning point is found when .

Example

If the logistics function can be used to predict the world population in billions of people in x years since 1900, then what is the maximum number of people that the earth can hold?

The numerator of the fraction gives the maximum value, so this model says that the earth can hold a maximum of 11.5 billion people.

Example

If the logistics function can be used to predict the world population in billions of people in x years since 1900, then did the growth slow down?

To do this, you need access to a graphing, scientific, or financial calculator. The turning point is found when , so you replace the A with 12.8 and the k with 0.0266 and you get that x = 95.84. So in about 1996, the population of the world was still growing, but the rate at which it was growing started decreasing.

Example

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has a logistics function, , where GDP is in billions and t is the number of years since 1970. According to this model, what will the GDP be in 2020?

To do this calculation, you need access to a graphing, scientific, or financial calculator. Replacing the t in the function with 50 (2020 is 50 years since 1970) you get:

The GDP is expected to be about 5,323 billion or 5.323 trillion dollars.

0.8 Infinite Series
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

8. Use the general term of a sequence and the rule for the sum of the series created to write out terms and find the sum of the desired number of terms.
Sigma Notation
(Interpret summation notation and do computations given the notation for a series.)

Sigma notation, or the summation symbol, is very handy and descriptive when dealing with sums of the terms in a sequence. The capital letter for sigma, Σ, is used to indicate this summation, and other symbols and expressions tell the rest.

Interpreting the notation you read it: “Find the sum of all the terms of form from n = 1 through n = 100.” Putting in the values for n, you would have something like: . The dots (ellipses) in the middle show a continued pattern. Writing all 100 numbers isn’t necessary.

Example

Compute

This says to add:

This says to add:

No, I didn’t write out all 100 numbers and add them. Since this is an arithmetic series, where each term is 5 greater than the previous term, I just used the formula.

Quick Math Fact

The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be found with: , where a1 is the first term, an is the last term, and n is the number of terms.

Using the formula and inserting 100 for n, 1 for a1 and 496 for a100, the sum is:

Example

Compute

Write the four terms in a sum, replacing n with the number of the term in each case.

Yes, a calculator is a big help in this case.

Partial Listing of Terms
(Listing the terms in a sequence from a rule or description and creating a rule from a list of terms.)

An infinite series is the sum of all the terms in a sequence. A sequence is a list of terms that can be created from some rule or formula—the terms all have something in common and any term can be created from the rule and its number. Some examples of how to define a sequence are: an = n + 1, an = 3n, , and so on. The possibilities are endless.

In each case, you find the terms of the sequence by substituting 1, 2, 3, … for n in the rule.

Example

Find the sum of the first six terms of the sequence an = 3n + 1.

Number of term: n
Term value: 3n + 1
1
3 (1) + 1 = 4 
2
3 (2) + 1 = 7 
3
3 (3) + 1 = 10
4
3 (4) + 1 = 13
5
3 (5) + 1 = 16
6
3 (6) + 1 = 19
The first six terms are: 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19. Did you notice that the difference between consecutive terms is always 3? This happens in arithmetic sequences.

Quick Math Fact

An arithmetic sequence has terms that increase or decrease by a common value. Each set of consecutive terms have a common difference between them. The general form of an arithmetic sequence is: an = a1 + (n − 1)d, where a1 is the first term, n is the number of the term in the sequence, and d is the common difference.

The sum of the terms in this sequence is: 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 + 16 + 19 = 69

Using the formula for the sum: . The answer checks!

Example

Find the sum of the first ten terms of the sequence an = 28 − n.

Number of term: n
Term value: an = 28 − n
1
28 − 1 = 27 = 128
2
28 − 2 = 26 = 64
3
28 − 3 = 25 = 32
4
28 − 4 = 24 = 16
5
28 − 5 = 23 = 8
6
28 − 6 = 22 = 4
7
28 − 7 = 21 = 2
8
28 − 8 = 20 = 1
9
10
The first ten terms in this sequence are: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, , . Did you notice that each successive term is one-half the previous term? This occurs in a geometric series.

Quick Math Fact

A geometric sequence has terms that increase or decrease by a common multiplier. Each set of consecutive terms have a common ratio between them. The general form of a geometric sequence is: an = a1rn − 1, where a1 is the first term, n is the number of the term in the sequence, and r is the common ratio.

The sum of the terms in this sequence is:

Quick Math Fact

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence can be found with: , where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Using the formula for this sum:

Example

Find the sum of the first four terms of the sequence

Number of term: n	Term value:
1
2
3
4
The first four terms of this sequence are , , , and their sum is .

The numerators increase by 1 with each successive term, and the denominators have increasing exponents. You often will not find formulas to sum sequences like this.

Example

Find a rule that describes the sequence 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, …

This is an arithmetic sequence. Each successive term is 4 greater than the previous term. So you want to write something like “previous term plus 4”.

Traditionally, an n or x or i is used in such rules. Let’s use n and multiply it by 4, since that’s the common difference. Using 4n and inserting a 1 for the n, we get the number 4. But the first term is 10, so we need 6 more. Letting the rule be an = 4n + 6, let’s see what the terms come out to be.

Number of term: n	Term value: 4n + 6
1
4 (1) + 6 = 10
2
4 (2) + 6 = 14
3
4 (3) + 6 = 18
4
4 (4) + 6 = 22
5
4 (5) + 6 = 26
6
4 (6) + 6 = 30
The rule works!

Example

Find a rule that describes the sequence 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, …

This is a power sequence. Each term is a power of the number 3. You write this as an = 3n, where n = 1, 2, 3, …

Special Sums
(Working with special rules for sums of terms in a sequence.)

A sequence is a list of numbers (or letters, in other contexts) that is formed by some special rule or formula. In many applications, it is necessary to add up some or all of the terms in the sequence. Many rules have formulas to use when finding a sum. It’s a good idea to take advantage of these sum formulas; they save time, and they usually are more accurate.

The following are some of the more “popular” special rules:

Description
Example
Sequence rule
Sum formula
Arithmetic sequence	2, 5, 8, 11, …	an = a1 + (n − 1)d	
Geometric sequence	2, 6, 18, 54, …	gn = k · rn − 1	
Integers	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …	an = n	
Squares of integers	1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …	qn = n2	
Cubes of integers	1, 8, 27, 64, 125, …	cn = n3	
Example

Find the sum of the first 50 terms of the arithmetic sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, …

This sequence has a first term of 2 and a common difference of 3.

The sum formula, , uses the first and last terms.

To find the 50th term, use the sequence rule:

Now use the sum formula:

The sum of the first 50 terms of the sequence is 3,775.

Example

Find the sum of the first 10 terms of the geometric sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, …

This sequence has a first term of 2 and a common ratio (multiplier) of 3.

The sum formula, , uses the first term and the ratio. Notice that the “counter” in the summation notation begins with i = 0. This is because the first term isn’t multiplied by 3, just the rest of the terms. Since we only want 10 terms, and we’re starting with the number 0, we’ll go from 0 to 9.

Using the sum formula:

Want to check this out? The terms are: 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, 486, 1458, 4374, 13122, 39366. Go ahead and add them up. Aren’t formulas wonderful?

Example

Find the sum of the first 20 squares 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …

The sum formula is . So just replace the n’s with 20.

Example

Given the twelve scores X = 3, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 14 and that the average score, , is 9, find the sum .

This formula determines the variance of a set of numbers. Replacing the Xi and , the sum reads:

Sums to Infinity and Limits
(Become acquainted with series that have no end.)

How can you add up a list of numbers that has no end? Sounds like a lot of work and an impossible task. But, thanks to the “magic” of mathematics, there are some sums that can be computed, even though the terms in the series go on forever. The best way to show and “prove” this to you is to give some examples. But first, here’s the mathematical rule that makes this possible.

Quick Math Fact

An infinite series that converges has ending terms that are all 0 as the number of terms increases significantly.

The sum of an infinite geometric series where the ratio is between −1 and +1 is found with the formula:

Example

Find the sum of the infinite series

The amount added gets smaller and small, and the total sum never exceeds 2.

Using the formula to get the sum of the infinite series:

The first term is 1, and the ratio is . So

Example

A super ball is dropped from a 64 foot building and bounces back 48 feet, which is of the distance it fell. After hitting the ground again, it bounces back 36 feet—again, of the distance it fell. Assume that this continues forever. What is the total distance that the ball travels?


The distance is twice a geometric series – plus the starting distance:

You can use a formula to find the sum of the infinite series, double that, and then add 64 to get the total distance.

The geometric series has a first term of 48 and a ratio of , so . The total distance is then 2 (192) + 64 = 448 feet.

0.9 Data Analysis - Inference
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

9. Use the results of data analysis and best-fit lines to determine the strength of relationships and their applications to situations.
Inferring
(Perform interpolation or extrapolation using a regression equation.)

A regression line is a model which is used to describe the relationship between input values and output values in a data set. Below, you see a data set, its plot, the best-fit line, and the regression equation for the average life-expectancy in the Americas. The years of life expectancy is for a person born in that particular year.

Year	Life Expectancy
1800	
27.5
1850	
35.1
1900	
41  
1950	
58.4
2000	
73.2

Equation

A(t) = 24.1 + 0.2294t, where t is the number of years since 1800 and A(t) is the life expectancy of a person born in that year.

The correlation coefficient for this line is r = 0.98 which is very good; it’s almost “1”.

Example

Using the regression equation, what is the average life expectancy of a person who was born in 1944?

The year 1944 is 144 years since 1800, so the value of t that you use is 144. Substituting into the equation, you have A(144) = 24.1 + 0.2294 (144) = 57.1 years.

This particular example illustrates “interpolation”—making a prediction of a value where the input is between some of the data points. The ages were given for the century and half-century values, not for the years in between.

Example

Using the regression equation, what is the average life expectancy of a person who will be born in 2050?

The year 2050 is 250 years since 1800, so the value of t that you use is 250. Substituting into the equation, you have A(250) = 24.1 + 0.2294 (250) = 81.5 years.

This particular example illustrates “extrapolation”—making a prediction of a value where the input is outside any of the data points. Extrapolation involves the assumption that things will continue as they have been.

Regression
(Examine an equation for a regression line and determine strength of the relationship.)

A regression line is a model which is used to describe the relationship between input values and output values in a data set. The relationship is shown with a figure (the data points and regression line), with a formula (the equation of a line), and with a value or “rating” of the relationship (correlation coefficient).

Example

Graph the data points in the chart showing the number of hours studied by 15 students and the score they received on the exam for which they were studying. Then draw a line through the points, getting as close as possible to as many as possible.

Hours	0	0	1	1	2	3	3	4	4	5	5	5	6	7	7	9
Score	41	35	40	48	50	60	68	60	65	72	66	75	80	84	90	93
Here’s a graph of the points and a line that’s trying to fit or describe them.


As you can see, the points don’t lie on the line. Some points are above, and some are below. You want to have the best fitting line possible—the one that has the smallest total vertical distance between the line and the points. The line chosen is called the regression line and can be used to predict more scores. Assuming that increasing the number of hours studied will increase the score, you can predict what the score would be if a person studied 10 hours or, because no one studied 8 hours, you could predict what that would produce.

Assume that the regression line above has the formula Score = 40 + 6 × h, where h is the number of hours. Using this formula, then a person studying 8 hours would expect a score of 40 + 6 × 8 = 40 + 48 = 88. This point would lie directly on the line, not above or below. But it’s just a prediction.

Example

Given the graph of the data, below, and the regression line with the equation y = 3.4x + 1, would the point (5, 17) lie above or below or on the regression line?


The best way to check to see where the point would lie is to enter x = 5 into the regression equation. This tells you the point on the line.

If y = 3.4x + 1, then, when x = 5, y = 3.4 (5) + 1 = 17 + 1 = 18. The point on the line is (5, 18), so the data point (5, 17) is below the regression line.

A least squares regression line is the line that makes the vertical distances between the data points and that line as small as possible. Each of the distances is squared when the regression coefficient is computed, because a consistent subtraction direction will make some distances positive and some distances negative—they’d cancel one another out.

Example

Graph the points (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 6), and (5, 2). Then compute the vertical distances between these points and the line with the equation y = 0.6x + 2.


The line with the equation y = 0.6x + 2 lies below some points and above others. The distances from the point vertical to a point on the line are shown. Is this the best line that could be found?

Technology is wonderful in that it allows you to determine the least squares regression line and the correlation coefficient, which is sort of a score for the line. All you have to do is put in the data points, and voila! And, just to help you appreciate it even more, the equation of the best-fit line and its correlation coefficient for the four points in the previous example will be computed, below. You can check it with your calculator.

Quick Math Fact

The formula for the best-fit regression line y = ax + b is found when:

The value of the correlation coefficient, r, is found with:

Example

Given the points (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 6), and (5, 2), find the best-fit regression line and the value of the correlation coefficient.

The formulas are full of sums of this and sums of that. It’s best to just make a quick chart and find those values before beginning.

Σy = 16
Σx2 = 54
Σy2 = 74
Σxy = 53
First, to find the value of a, the slope of the regression line:

Now, finding the value of b, the y-intercept:

So the equation of the best-fit line is y = −0.6x + 6.1. This is NOT the line that’s shown. But how good a fit is this “best fit” line?

Computing the value of r:

So what does this correlation coefficient mean? The value of the correlation coefficient ranges from −1 to 1. The closer the coefficient is to 1 or, when negative the closer to −1, the better the fit. If the coefficient for a particular data set is 1, then every point is on the line. If the score is 0.7, then that’s pretty close and a relatively strong score. A score of 0.5 indicates moderate correlation. Statisticians usually like to see scores greater than 0.5 before considering the correlation to be significant.

The same goes for the negative correlations. A score of −1 means a perfect negative correlation. A score of −0.7 is strong negative, −0.5 is a moderate negative correlation. The closer to 1 or −1, the better the model is at predicting future results.

So, in the above example, the correlation of −0.4243 is not very good. There doesn’t seem to be much correlation between the input and the output. They’re “all over the place”.

Again, it is much better to take advantage of technology. Graphing and financial calculators will do these computations quickly and easily.

0.10 Earnings Quality
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

10. Compare methods of computing cost of goods and depreciation so to correctly apply to particular situations.
FIFO vs LIFO
(Compare the cost of doing business using FIFO vs LIFO.)

The acronym FIFO stands for “First In First Out” and LIFO is for “Last In First Out”. In either case, the cost of goods will be deducted from the revenue. It’s the net profit that can change, if the cost has varied over the course of the financial period. If a company wants to show less profit, then they’ll use the accounting system in which the higher costs will be incorporated.

First, though, let’s start with profit, revenue, and cost.

Profit = Revenue − Cost

The equation is pretty straight-forward, although it can get complicated, depending on your business. Beginning with the cost function, you have fixed costs and variable costs. The fixed costs include salaries, insurance, mortgage payments, and so on. These are items that don’t change with the number of items that are produced or sold. On the other hand, there are also variable costs. If the number of items sold increases, then that changes the cost of producing or purchasing those items. You also may have to pay overtime.

The cost function can be represented with: Cost = Fixed cost + Variable cost or C(n) = Fixed + Variable × n where n represents the number of items. Consider the situation where it costs a company $453 to produce each lawn mower, and there are fixed costs of $2500. Then the cost function would read: C(n) = 2500 + 453n.

The revenue function can be pretty simple. You charge so much money for each item. R(n) = price × n. Going back to this lawn mower company, they charge $749 per lawn mower. So R(n) = 749n.

Putting the cost and revenue together, you create the profit function: P(n) = R(n) − C(n). In the case of the lawn mowers, P(n) = 749n − (2500 + 453n) = 296n − 2500.

Example

How many lawn mowers does the company have to sell in order to break even?

A company breaks even when the profit changes from a negative value to a positive value. They have to sell enough to cover all the fixed costs. If P(n) = 296n − 2500, then the number of mowers, n, has to be large enough so you get a positive value after subtracting 2500. To solve for n, let P(n) = 0.

So they have to sell 9 lawn mowers in order to break even and show a positive profit.

The example above assumes that it always costs $453 to make a lawn mower. A lot of times, the cost can fluctuate, depending on the cost of supplies and labor and other factors. Let’s consider the situation where the cost per quarter is as shown.

Example

Determine the cost using FIFO and LIFO.

The company produces 340 lawn mowers and sells 250 of them. What was the cost of the 250 lawn mowers? It depends on whether you use FIFO or LIFO.

With FIFO, First In First Out, you start at the beginning of the time period. So you take:

The total cost of the 250 lawn mowers is $116,140.

But what do you get using LIFO, Last In First Out? You start at the end of the time period and work backwards:

The total cost of the 250 lawn mowers is $112,170.

Using LIFO, you show a greater profit, because the cost is less. The choice depends on whether you want to impress stock holders more or pay less in taxes.

Depreciation
(Compare methods of computing the depreciation of an item.)

The depreciation of an item is how much of its value has been lost over a particular time period. We’re often told that, as soon as you drive that new car off the lot, you’ve lost $4000 in value. But, in general, the things to consider when determining depreciation are: the original value of the item, its salvage value, and the expected life of the item. Then you employ some depreciation method.

There are many different depreciation methods available. Here are three of them, just to give you an idea of how they can vary.

Straight-line depreciation
Doubling-declining-balance depreciation
Sum-of-years-digits depreciation
Let’s consider the amount of depreciation of a refrigerated delivery truck. Its original cost is $75,000 with a salvage value of $2500 at the end of 10 years.

Example

Determine the depreciation, over a 10 year period, of the truck costing $75,000 with a salvage value of $2500 using straight-line depreciation.

Straight-line depreciation involves just what the name suggests. You can draw a straight line through the declining values of the item on a graph. The value depreciates the same amount every year. So, if it cost $75,000 and the salvage value is $2500, you will depreciate 75,000 − 2,500 = 72,500 over 10 years. Dividing by 10, the depreciation is $7,250 per year. Here’s a table showing the depreciation and value each year.

Year	Begin	Deprec.	End
 1	75,000	7,250	67,750
 2	67,750	7,250	60,500
 3	60,500	7,250	53,250

 9	17,000	7,250	 9,750
10	 9,750	7,250	 2,500
Example

Determine the depreciation, over a 10 year period, of the truck costing $75,000 with a salvage value of $2500 using double-declining-balance depreciation.

If an item has a ten year life, then, with straight-line depreciation, it would depreciate by 10% each year.

But, with double-declining-balance, it declines by 20% per year. How can that be, you ask? That would add up to 200%! But the way this works is that the beginning-of-year value declines by 20%, not the original value each year. So you multiply each beginning-of-the-year value by 20% to determine the depreciation for that year. You’ll have to “fudge” at the end—it doesn’t come out to the salvage value when you reduce by 20%. So you make a special adjustment in the final year. The following table shows you how this works.

Year	Begin	20% Deprec.	End

Determine the depreciation, over a 10 year period, of the truck costing $75,000 with a salvage value of $2500 using the sum-of-years-digits method.

This method loads the greatest amount of depreciation toward the beginning of the life of the item.

First you add up the years’ digits. There are 10 years, so you add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55. This gives you the denominator of fractions that will have all the digits as numerators.

These all add up to 1, of course. Using this method of depreciation, you start with the largest fraction, at the end, and use it as that year’s depreciation. Then you work your way down the list. Multiply each of these times the original value minus the salvage value, so you’ll end up with the salvage value.

The first year will have ; the second year will have , and so on. The table shows you how this works.

The depreciation method you choose all depends on the business and how you want the figures to work out for you.

0.11 Accounting Cycle and Adjusting Journal Entries
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Explain the accounting cycle.
2. Describe the role of adjusting journal entries.
Explain the Accounting Cycle
Explaining accounting and how it works starts with an understanding of the accounting cycle. This is where the full process of accounting begins, ends, and starts all over. To begin this discussion, let us first think about the operating cycle.

The business world operates within the operating cycle—the process of turning cash back into cash. For a merchandising company, an operating cycle functions as shown in Exhibit 0.11.1.

Why This Matters to Business
While all the functions of an operating cycle are occurring within a business, activities within the accounting cycle are also occurring. Information is being tracked by an accounting information system so companies can see how they are doing operationally. Without accurate and timely financial information, there is no way to know if a company is meeting its targets, even if the company seems to be operating effectively. Thus, an understanding of accounting and how it works, at least on a basic level is important for all individuals involved in the financial side of a business.

EXHIBIT 0.11.1


The Accounting Cycle
Now let’s start thinking about the accounting cycle (Exhibit 0.11.2). The accounting cycle begins the minute an economic event or transaction occurs. Let’s think of a trip to your local Grocery Mart. When a customer walks up to a self-checkout line to buy a tube of toothpaste and the product is scanned, an economic event has occurred. In order for Grocery Mart to operate both efficiently and effectively, every time a tube of toothpaste is scanned and purchased, the store needs to have an accounting record of it. Think of the accounts being affected when this occurs. Grocery Mart has received Cash or payment via a credit card. A Sale has occurred. Inventory has been reduced, and thus Cost of Goods Sold should be recognized. All of these accounts must be properly recorded in the accounting records in order for Grocery Mart to make informed decisions using accurate information.

Why This Matters to Business
Each of these accounts is affected based on one swipe of the bar code on a tube of toothpaste at a self- checkout machine. If this transaction is not properly recorded, the accounts will not be correct.

EXHIBIT 0.11.2


Stop and Consider: What is a possible consequence if the accounting information is inaccurate?

Grocery Mart could run out of a specific type of toothpaste if managers did not know the store was running low at a particular point in time. Customers could get frustrated and shop elsewhere!

All transactions find their way to the accounting system in the form of a journal entry, either by a direct journal entry or a summary journal entry lumping many, many transactions into one entry. Just think about how many invoices a company might receive in any given day. If each transaction was posted as a separate entry accounting, it would take too many hours so the transactions are often batched by days. After the journal entries have been recorded in the system, they are posted to the general ledger. Posting to the general ledger is how the results of sales transactions that involve Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold become part of the accounting and information system.


Example

Suppose the Food Giant grocery chain received an invoice for payment for a shipment of pasta it purchased to sell as inventory. An economic event or transaction has occurred. Someone in the accounts payable department must now input the invoice into the system. Once input, the invoice becomes part of an automated system, allowing the company’s accounting and information system to create a journal entry for the transaction.

The invoice will be entered into the system by the following journal entry.

Debit	Pasta Inventory	xxx	 
Credit	    Accounts Payable, Pasta Company	 	xxx
This journal entry is posted into the general ledger.

Once all entries have been posted for a particular time period, a trial balance is prepared. A trial balance shows the balance of all active accounts, and total debits and credits must always be equal. This is due to the double-entry accounting system. Mathematical mistakes and erroneous postings often become apparent if a trial balance does not balance. Once a trial balance is complete, a worksheet may be utilized to help prepare financial statements. A worksheet helps verify the accuracy of the accounting information before the formal financial statements are prepared. The worksheet is typically considered optional. This is because the automated accounting and information systems used today often do much of this verification for you. Errors are often noted as soon as the transaction was entered into the system, long before a worksheet was ever prepared.


At this point in the accounting cycle, it is time to prepare adjusting journal entries. This is necessary order to adhere to both the revenue and expense recognition principles, which must be abided by in accounting. An easy way to understand this is by thinking of the fact that revenues should be recorded when earned, regardless of when they are received and expenses are recognized when used or incurred. It would be great if every customer paid companies immediately for goods and services received, but we all know this is not the case. Adjusting journal entries allow us to record the revenue earned in the current accounting period, even if payment is actually received several accounting periods in the future.

Financial Statements
Once adjusting journal entries are complete, the financial statements are prepared. These statements are utilized by investors, creditors, analysts, and more. The three main financial statements are:

Income statement.
Balance sheet.
Statement of cash flows.
Closing the Books
Closing the books is the last step in the accounting cycle. In this process, all temporary or nominal accounts are closed out to a zero balance in order to start at a zero balance at the beginning of the next fiscal year. Temporary accounts are those primarily on the income statement. The balance sheet accounts are considered permanent and are not closed. In other words, these accounts keep accumulating from one fiscal year to the next. An income statement account, however, is a temporary account that is closed into retained earnings at the end of the fiscal year.

Stop and Consider : What happens to net income once it is closed at the end of the year?

If net income just kept building from one year to the next, you would never really know how a company was performing in the current year. One final item to understand is this: when the income statement accounts are closed, where do they go? They do not just vanish! The answer to this question is that they go to the balance sheet through the Retained Earnings account. In this way, the income statement lives on from one year to the next. Net income or net loss for the year ends up as part of retained earnings on the balance sheet.


From this point, the accounting cycle repeats itself. Each fiscal year end marks the end of an accounting period, and once a year ends, a new year quickly begins. The accounting cycle continues.

Describe the Role of Adjusting Journal Entries
Adjusting Journal Entries Revisited
Most activities are recorded through basic journal entries directly by an accounting and information system or by an individual recording operational activity. Some activities, however, such as receiving revenues in advance, paying expenses in advance, incurring expenses but not yet paying for them, or earning revenue but not yet receiving it, require adjustments. This is where adjusting journal entries come into play.

Example

On December 31, Logan must pay rent to her landlord at The Flats for the month of January. When this occurs, from Logan’s perspective, a deferred or prepaid expense has been incurred. At the end of January, an adjusting journal entry is necessary in order to properly state the account balances and to therefore properly present the financial statements.

Logan prepays one month’s rent on December 31. The journal entry to record the rent payment is:

Debit	Prepaid Rent	xxx	
Credit	    Cash		xxx
On January 31, once the prepaid month is over, the adjusting journal entry is:

Debit	Rent Expense	xxx	
Credit	    Prepaid Rent	 	xxx
Initially the prepaid rent is recorded in into an asset account. After the rent is utilized, it is transferred into an expense account. Think of it as the rent cost being expired. It was a prepaid asset, as it was paid ahead of time. Once the month of January came to an end, that prepaid asset was used up: time to recognize it as an expense.

The same example can be looked at from the landlord’s perspective. The Flats received Logan’s money on December 31 before it had been earned. (Because of the revenue recognition principle, the revenue for rent cannot be recognized by the landlord until the month is over.) The journal entry to record the receipt of rent payment on January 1 is

Debit	Cash	xxx	 
Credit	    Unearned Rent	 	xxx
The Unearned Rent account is a liability because The Flats owes Logan something it owes her one month of living at its apartment complex.

Initially the rent is recognized as a liability account. After the month of living at the apartment complex has been provided to the tenant, it is recognized in a revenue account. The Flats no longer owes Logan living space for the month of January. It has earned revenue for the month that she lived there.

On January 31, the adjusting journal entry to record the month’s rent that is now earned is:

Debit	Unearned Rent	xxx	 
Credit	    Rent Revenue	 	xxx
The focus of the adjusting journal entry examples is rent. This is because most students pay rent at some point during their college career. It may be useful to think about another concept that most of you have had experience with, which is car insurance. Many students have had to think about car insurance at some point in time, and the principles are the same as for rent. Typically, rent is paid in advance, which means the lessee (tenant) has a prepaid asset that needs to be expensed over time and the lessor (landlord) has a liability that turns into revenue when earned. The same is true with insurance. The vehicle owner pays in advance and therefore has a prepaid asset, and the insurance provider receives payment in advance and has a liability is earned and reported as revenue as the insurance period expires. If you would like to think of adjusting journal entries with an additional, relatable example, substitute the word insurance for rent in the examples above.

Summary
Knowing how to explain the accounting cycle is a great skill to have. It helps you better understand the information that will be presented to you throughout your career in finance. When making financial decisions based on accounting data that will be provided to you, it will be helpful to have an overall understanding of the source of the accounting information. Although creating adjusting journal entries from scratch is typically not a part of a corporate analyst’s job responsibilities, understanding the theory behind adjusting journal entries goes a long way toward improving your confidence in utilizing accounting information. If you can describe the role of adjusting journal entries and understand their purpose, you will be able to demonstrate a stronger understanding of accounting. Accounting is known as the language of business. The more you learn this language, the stronger you will be throughout the many financial conversations that will occur in your future.

0.12 Income Statement
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Discuss the usefulness of the income statement.
2. Demonstrate income statement formats.
3. Explain how the income statement relates to other key financial statements.
Business activities and overall financial performance are reflected in a company’s financial statements. There are three main financial statements that financial statement users work with:

Income Statement.
Balance Sheet.
Statement of Cash Flows.
This section explains the income statement.

Usefulness of the Income Statement
The income statement shows a company’s revenues and expenses, as well as gains and losses for a period. This statement shows overall profits or losses for a company. Overall profits are referred to as net income, and overall losses are referred to as net loss. Many people feel that the income statement is the “exciting” or “go to” statement. Most decisions about a company, after all, are aided by knowing more about the company’s net income or net loss over the past few years.

1. Stop and Consider: How is an income statement helpful if you are considering investing in a company?

When making an investment in a company, it is important to see how the company has been performing, not only in the current period but also in recent years. You may wish to invest in a company that is performing well in hopes of gaining from that company’s success. You may also wish to invest in a company that is performing poorly in hopes of reaping the benefits of a company turnaround, by buying stock low and selling high after recovery. Regardless of your investment strategy, the income statement will provide you with key information about a company’s performance. This will allow you to make informed investment decisions.

The income statement, as well as the balance sheet and statement of cash flows, is used for other decisions, such as whether to lend a company money or whether to accept a position as an employee at a company. The list of uses for the income statement can become extensive. The uses referred to so far are based on external user decisions. Decisions such as whether to maintain a particular business operation or to discontinue it, whether to continue to make a production part or to buy it from an outside supplier, or whether to hire an additional supervisor to oversee a growing operation are internal user decisions. The income statement can help with all these decisions, both external and internal.

Example

Jordan just graduated with a finance degree from Green State. She has developed an interest in the manufacturing industry. Due to high grades and active involvement in her community, Jordan received two job offers within the auto parts manufacturing industry. Both offers are similar in salary and benefits. In deciding which company to work for, Jordan will look at personality match, corporate culture, location, and many other qualitative factors. She will most likely also look at quantitative data available for the companies. She will look at net income and net loss data for recent years. She may also look at trends in sales revenue to see if one company is performing better than the other. She may even look at expenses and see how efficiently the companies are operating by comparing total expenses to total sales revenue. There are many ways the company income statements may be useful to Jordan in her decision process.

2. Stop and Consider: How can external users rely on information provided by a company when those users have no access to any of the company’s financial records to verify what they are seeing?

Most larger companies are audited by independent third parties. In fact, the SEC requires all publicly traded companies to be audited before their stock can be on a public securities exchange. Many private and not-for-profit companies are audited as well. So if you ever wonder if you can trust a company’s income statement to be a fair reflection of what actually occurred, look to see if the company has auditied financial staements with an annual audit report. Educating yourself on the audit report is another tool that can prove to be useful during your financial career. You should learn to read it carefully enough to see if the company has any major issues.

Income Statement Formats
The income statement has two common formats: the single-step format and the multiple-step format. Both formats are acceptable under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and are widely used in the business world. Publicly traded companies often use the multiple-step format, as it provides more detail. It is important to note that regardless of which format is used, the final net income amount will be the same. This will be demonstrated in the examples below.

The single-step format is utilized by companies that value simplicity. With the single-step format, all revenues and gains are grouped together to form a single category. All expenses and losses are grouped in the same way. This allows a basic presentation that even non-financial-minded individuals can follow. It allows the question, “Do revenues and gains exceed expenses and losses?” to be quickly and easily answered. (See Exhibit 0.12.1).

EXHIBIT 0.12.1 Single-Step Income Statement

Shoe Manufacturing Inc.
Single-Step Income Statement
For the Year Ended December 31, 2021
Revenue and Gains	 	 	 
    Sales	 	$50,000	 
    Interest Revenue	12,000	 
    Gain on Sale of Plant Assets	9,500	 
Total Revenue and Gains	$71,500
 	 	 	 	 
Expenses and Losses	 	 	 
    Cost of Goods Sold	$3,500	 
    Depreciation Expense	2,000	 
    Salary and Wages Expense	11,000	 
    Utility Expense	5,000	 
    Loss on Sale of Plant Assets	1,300	 
Total Expenses and Losses	$22,800
 	 	 	 
Net Income	$48,700
In this illustration, financial statement users can quickly determine that Shoe Manufacturing Inc. had a positive net income. They can see that at the end of the fiscal year, the company had generated $48,700 of net income. For many financial statement users, this is enough information.

Example

Should you go to work for Shoe Manufacturing Inc.? As mentioned above, qualitative factors should be considered. From a quantitative perspective, however, a single-step income statement can tell you that Shoe Manufacturing Inc. is operating profitably, and this may be all the information you need before accepting the position. A financial statement user may not need or want more detail than this. On the other hand, if you also have a job offer from a company that has a net income of $500,000, perhaps you would choose that company instead. Either way, looking at the single-step income statement can aid you in choosing between potential employers.

3. Stop and Consider: When you graduate with your finance degree, will you be able to fix a broken pipe, defend someone in a court of law, or teach a third grader how to do long division? Your finance degree probably will not prepare you for those tasks. In the same way, a plumber, attorney, and elementary school teacher may not be able to interpret complicated financial statements. The single-step income statement, however, allows financial statement users with many different backgrounds, including the ones discussed here, to utilize financial statements. Given its simplicity, this form of statement can be useful to a wide range of users.

The multiple-step format is utilized by companies who prefer more detail. The statement is broken down into categories that many find useful in making key decisions. Gross margin and operational margins are easier to compare in this format, as you can see in Exhibit 0.12.2.

EXHIBIT 0.12.2 Multiple-Step Income Statement

Shoe Manufacturing Inc.
Multiple-Step Income Statement
For the Year Ended December 31, 2021
Sales	 	$50,000 
Less:	 	 	 
  Cost of Goods Sold	3,500 	 
Gross Margin	 	$46,500
 	 	 	 
Operational Expenses	 	 	 
  Depreciation Expense	 	$  2,000 	 
  Salary and Wages Expense	 	11,000 	 
  Utility Expense	 	5,000 	 
Total Operating Expenses	 	$18,000
 	 	 	 
Other Revenues and Expenses	 	 
  Interest Revenue	$12,000 	 
  Gain on Sale of Plant Assets	9,500 	 
  Loss on Sale of Plant Assets	(1,300)	 
Total Other Revenues and Expense	$20,200
 	 	 	 
Net Income	 	 	$48,700
 	 	 	 
In this illustration, you can see that the net income of $48,700 is the same for both the single-step and the multiple-step income statement. You can also see that a financial statement user has more detail to evaluate in a multiple-step income statement. Instead of all revenues and gains being summarized together, they are broken apart into subcategories to provide more useful data. If you see gross margin when looking at an income statement, you are looking at a multiple-step statement. This category shows you how much a company is making from the actual product. In this example, Shoe Manufacturing Inc. is generating $46,500 from the sale of the product.

Gross profit is useful for financial statement users in making decisions. If you are trying to see how well a company is doing, it is helpful to initially see how much that company is making directly from the sale of the product. Companies that have very high marketing budgets, for example, need to be generating a very high margin on the product itself to support the operating expenses they rely on. Think about Nike. Nike needs to make a significant amount of money from the sale of a pair of shoes to offset its selling and administrative costs. A quick review of a multiple-step income statement can help you analyze that.

A gross profit margin calculation performed for Shoe Manufacturing Inc. will include the following:

Shoe Manufacturing Inc. has a gross profit margin of 93 percent.

4. Stop and Consider: Can you name one key reason why knowing Shoe Manufacturing Inc’s gross profit margin would help you analyze and better understand the company? One key factor is that it allows you to compare Shoe Manufacturing Inc.’s gross profit margin with those of other companies in the same industry. It is always important to compare your company’s gross profit margin to others in the industry. For example, 93 percent may seem high for Shoe Manufacturing Inc., but if all other major competitors in the industry are at 95 percent or more, the 93 percent could be worrisome. Small percentages can mean a lot in the competitive business world we live in.

The mutliple-step income statement also breaks down selling and adminstrative expenses in the operating expenses section of the income statement. Other gains and losses that are outside of the company’s regular operations are reported in their own section. Many financial statement users rely on the information provided in these categories to make key financial decisions because other revenues and gains, and other expenses and losses are not usually recurring.

How the Income Statement Relates to Other Key Financial Statements
Before we move on from the income statement to the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows, it is important to understand how the income statement relates to each.

Once final net income or net loss has been determined for a period, the amount is transferred into Retained Earnings on the balance sheet. Retained Earnings is increased or decreased each year by the amount of profit or loss a company has made. When net income or loss is closed out each year on the income statement, the dollar amount of the income or loss is moved into Retained Earnings, which is a permanent account on the balance sheet that is not closed out at year end. In this way, the income statement lives on from year to year, even though it is closed out at year end.

The current year net income or net loss is the starting point for the operating section of the statement of cash flows. Since net income is reported on the accrual-basis (both net income and the SCF are based on GAAP, and the reason there is a reconciliation is to convert accrual basis to cash basis and the statement of cash flows is reported on a cash basis, the statement of cash flows starts out by reconciling the GAAP-based net income to cash basis.

In order to be complete and properly stated, the balance sheet and statement of cash flows rely on a proper net income or net loss amount. (See Exhibit 0.12.3).

EXHIBIT 0.12.3 Net Income Links the Three Main Financial Statements


Summary
The income statement is useful in many different ways. As a finance major, you will most likely find both external and internal uses of the information reported in this statement. Being able to utilize the income statement to make key decisions both personally and for your company is a useful skill. Recognizing the different formats of an income statement is also important. Companies can decide which format they would prefer to utilize. You will see both formats as you continue to analyze more companies in the future. Understanding the similarities and differences between the single-step and the multiple-step income statements can be helpful. Finally, having an overall understanding of how the income statement results impact both the balance sheet and statement of cash flows can improve your overall financial knowledge. Next, we will look more closely at the balance sheet.

0.13 Balance Sheet
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Discuss the usefulness of the balance sheet.
2. Demonstrate the balance sheet format.
3. Explain how the balance sheet relates to other key financial statements.
Usefulness of the Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company’s financial position at a specific point in time. It provides detail about the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity, showing what a company owns and owes. The balance sheet has many uses. Knowing what a company’s net worth is and understanding whether a company should be able to make its payments and sustain operations with its working capital are some of the key uses. Both accounting and finance professionals find this information useful.

A company’s net worth is determined by subtracting liabilities from assets. Every company will determine its net worth goals and requirements, and they can be very different from company to company. Typically, companies prefer a high net worth, but there are instances when a company may have a negative net worth and still continue to operate, as long as cash flow can be managed and creditors are being paid. (Obviously, the latter is not ideal.) Almost all companies, however, share the goal of being able to pay for liabilities from existing assets. Most companies hope to pay for current liabilities from current assets. Working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. Individuals looking at investing and creditors looking at lending money will often calculate working capital. Working capital is a good way to determine whether or not a company has strong liquidity.

Stop and Consider: How can a balance sheet help you quickly determine if a company of interest has good liquidity?

If you learn how to recognize which types of assets and liabilities are current, the math is typically simple. Often, balance sheets have the current assets and current liabilities nicely classified! If not provided, you can learn to identify which assets are current, such as cash, receivables, and inventory. You can also learn to identify which liabilities are current, such as accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and dividends payable. Once identified, you can calculate and utilize working capital in your decision-making process.

Example

Joshua Tree Inc. has the following balances (in thousands): Cash $352; Receivables $225; Inventory $180, Property, Plant, and Equipment $680; Accounts Payable $136; Accrued Interest $85; Dividends Payable $45; and Long-Term Notes Payable $800. No other asset or liability accounts exist. What is the company’s net worth and what is its working capital?

Stop and Consider: Can there be a negative consequence of incorrectly classifying current assets and current liabilities?

Improper operational decisions can be made if you improperly classify current versus noncurrent assets and liabilities. In the Joshua Tree example above, notice that net worth is a different amount than working capital. If you were making an inventory-related decision, for example, and you did not realize that property, plant, and equipment and notes payable were noncurrent, you might make your inventory decision based on $371 (net worth) instead of the proper $491 (working capital) amount. This may alter your decision process in some way.

Did You Know

You should be aware that GAAP-based reporting standards in the United States differ from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). One of the major differences is that IFRS may reports assets such as PP&E at market or fair value, whereas U.S. GAAP reports at historical cost, This is especially important if, during your finance career, you find yourself comparing a U.S.-based company to a company based in a country that uses IFRS. The old phrase you are not comparing apples to apples becomes relevant. When studying both companies’ assets, it will be important to remember that one company may be reporting at historical cost while the other is reporting at fair value. This can be a significant factor in the analysis.

While considering the usefulness of the balance sheet, it is important to recognize that with financial statements based on U.S. GAAP, the reported amounts represent the assets historical cost. This means that no matter how long ago the asset was purchased, the value on the balance sheet is historical or original cost, not market value. One area most affected by this is Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E).

Stop and Consider: A building is a great example of PP&E that is heavily impacted by historical cost valuation. Think of a building bought 20 years ago in a city that was suffering extreme financial hardship. That same city today has once again become a thriving metropolitan area. The building could have been purchased 20 years ago for $500,000 but today could have a market value of $2,000,000. The $500,000 would still be reflected on a GAAP-based balance sheet, while the $2,000,000 is nowhere to be found. How could this impact a financial statement user?

Regardless of initial or not, the building is still reflected as cost less accumulated depreciation. Replace this part of the sentence with: On the financial statements, the building would reflect the $500,000 historical cost, less the accumulated depreciation that has been recorded. For all decisions that are asset-based, such as a company’s net worth, asset values could be substantially less than what the assets are truly worth in the marketplace. Both accounting and finance professionals see the flaws in this way of presentation. The difficulty and expense of determining what market value is at any point in time is part of the reason U.S. GAAP requires reporting at historical cost versus maket value.

The Balance Sheet Format
The balance sheet is structured around the basic accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder’s Equity. The format of the balance sheet is actually designed around this equation (see Exhibit 0.13.1).

EXHIBIT 0.13.1


Did You Know?

Another difference between GAAP and IFRS that relates to this section is the reporting of assets and liablities according to liquidity. IFRS lists noncurrent assets before current assets and noncurrent liablities before current liailities. IFRS uses the opposite order, reporting the least liquid items first. So again, if you find yourself at some point in your future looking at international financial statements, make sure you are aware of this difference.

To look at an example, see Exhibit 3-1 Diaz Manufacturing Balance Sheets as of December 31.

Looking at this example, you can see that total assets (on the left side of the statement) equal total Liablities and equity (on the right side). The double-entry accounting system ensures that debits equal credits, so the total of both side of the statement. Note that more than one year of financial information is provided. Most balance sheets provide the current year’s balance as well as the previous year’s for comparison purposes. This allows a financial statement user to quickly compare asset, liability, and equity amounts from one period to the next. This information allows users to calculate key financial ratios or simply do a quick change-in-balance analysis—comparing this year’s cash balance to last, for example.

A classified balance sheet has clear subtotals for current assets and current liabilities and noncurrent liablities. It is helpful when these categories are nicely laid out for you, but if they are not, a basic understanding of current versus noncurrent is useful. Later, in our ratio section, we will look at some key ratios in which current versus noncurrent classifications can make a big difference in how calcualtion ends up.

Finally, within the various classifications of current assets and current liabilities, the assets and liabilites are listed in order of liquidity (e.g., how quickly an asset can be converted to cash that will be readily available for the company to use). For example, cash is most liquid, followed by accounts receivable and then inventory. On the liablility side, accounts payable, notes payable, and accrued taxes are considered current, whereas long-term debt is noncurrent.

How the Balance Sheet Relates to Other Key Financial Statements
As discussed earlier, once net income is finalized, it increases retained earnings on the balance sheet. Although retained earnings is a component of the balance sheet, companies often have a separate stockholders’ equity detailing the components of the retained earnings balance for the period. When the statement of retained earnings is present, net income is added and dividends declared are subtracted from the beginning balance of retained earnings to calculate the year-end balance.

Another key relationship to understand is how cash on the balance sheet compares to cash on the statement of cash flows (Exhibit 0.13.2). On the balance sheet, you can see the beginning balance of cash and the ending balance of cash. You see this in the comparative numbers when both the current- and prior-year financials are provided. That same cash amounts are represented as the beginning and ending cash amounts on the statement of cash flows, but in this statement, the activities that caused the changes in cash are explained. The next section will cover the statement of cash flows in greater detail.

EXHIBIT 0.13.2


Summary
The balance sheet helps financial statement users with the decision-making process in many ways. Providing amounts to be used to determine amounts such as net worth and working capital is one example. Despite the usefulness of the balance sheet, there are limitations. One primary limitation is the fact that, under U.S. GAAP, some items are presented at historical cost rather than at current value. Despite this limitation, financial statement users can gain useful information by comparing account balances from one year to the next. Understanding liquidity is critical to a company’s successful operations. The accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity, represents how the balance sheet is presented. Finally, the three main financial statements are all linked together, as illustrated in this module.

0.14 Statement of Cash Flows
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Discuss the usefulness of the statement of cash flows.
2. Demonstrate the format of the statement of cash flows.
3. Explain how the statement of cash flows relates to other key financial statements.
Usefulness of the Statement of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows is a financial statement that helps users understand not just how much cash changed in a reporting period, but also how it changed. Business students often only think of the income statement and balance sheet when asked to analyze a company’s financial statements, not even giving the statement of cash flows an initial thought. The reality is, however, that the statement of cash flows is a highly useful tool for ensuring that a company can continue to operate effectively into the future. Without this statement, a change in cash balance can be deceiving.

Stop and Consider: Think of a company that had $400,000 cash at the beginning of the period but and $600,000 at the end of the period. Would your initial feeling be positive or negative when you learned that the overall cash balance went up $200,000?

Most financial statement users would feel very positive about a $200,000 increase in cash. Who would not like a larger verses a smaller balance of cash, after all? The reality is, however, that if the $200,000 increase came solely as the result of a $250,000 loan, the increase is not as positive as it initially seemed. Overall cash went up $200,000 in this example, but overall debt went up $250,000. So cash did increase, but at what cost? The company now has a lot of additional debt to repay.

In order for a company to continue to operate in the long run, the company must have positive income from operations. Likewise, in order for a company to be able to rely on proper cash flows in the long run, the company must have positive cash flow from the regular operations of its business. The statement of cash flows shows how much cash is being provided by, or used by, the operations of the business. The cash provided by the operations of a business is the cash from the company’s main line of operations For example, a shoe manufacturer generates profit and cash by selling its shoes and other related products. A doctor’s office generates profit and cash by providing healthcare services. The income received from the sale of shoes and heatlhcare services is considered operational. The statement of cash flows identifies the cash that was brought into or taken out of the company based on the operational components of the business.

Stop and Consider: Here are three sources of cash for a company the company can sell its products or services, sell a fixed asset that it owns, or borrow money. Of the three examples, which way is the most favorable and why?

The best way in the long-run for a company to bring in cash is through its operations, by selling its products or services. Although selling a fixed asset that has possibly appreciated in value can be very positive, and clearly brings in positive cash flow, this is not something that can be relied on regularly in the future. Companies have limited fixed assets, so selling them in order to achieve positive cash flow is not sustainable in the long-run. Finally, a company would not want to borrow money each time there was a need for cash.

As you learn more about the format of the statement of cash flows, it will become more apparent how useful the statement can be.

The Format of the Statement of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows exists in two common formats: direct and indirect. There are advantages and disadvantages to each method. The direct method is the preferred method according to the rule-making authorities in the accounting profession, as it is more transparent to users. This method shows the primary cash receipts and cash payments for the period. The disadvantage to the direct method is the time and expense involved in maintaining the accounting records in a way that makes this method possible. Separate accounting records, above and beyond regularly used accounting system records, are often required. The indirect method is preferred by most companies. The method starts with A reconciliation of net income to cash flows provided or used by operating activities. For this reason, almost all U.S. companies you will analyze will present their statements of cash flows in the indirect format. The format of the indirect method, therefore, will be the focus of our attention in this section.

Did You Know: You learned that under U.S. GAAP, we can use one of two methods: direct and indirect. Although the direct method is preferred, the indirect method is the most frequently used. If you find yourself analyzing international financial statements, however, you will most likely examine a direct method statement of cash flows. It is therefore important for you to know that this format exists. It is quite common for finance majors to analyze international financial statements at some point during their careers.

The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows prepared under the indirect method begins with a reconciliation of net income to cash provided or used by operating activities. This reconciliation appears in the operating activities section of the statement. Examine Exhibit 3.4 Diaz Manufacturing Statement of Cash Flows for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31 in your textbook. You can see when you look at this example that the statement includes three main sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.

The operating activities of the statement of cash flows begins with net income as reported on the income statement, which is Net income on the income statement is reported according to accrual-based accounting. Revenue is recorded when it is earned and expenses when they are incurred, not when the cash is received and paid. The statement of cash flows shows operating activities on a cash basis. For this reason, we start by adding back noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization to net income. Depreciation, for example, is an expense that reduces net income but has no cash impact. Therefore, in the operating activities section reconciliation, you must add this noncash expense back. You also need to reverse the effects of gains or losses from the period. This is because gains are added to net income but have no cash impact. Losses reduced net income though no cash if paid. Finally, you must also make adjustments for changes that occured in non-cash current assets and current liabilities during the period. These changes impact net income differently than they do cash and must be reconciled back to the cash basis. Fortunately, only the “net” change in each non-cash current asset and current liability account must be reported.

Example

TBL Products, Inc., has net income of $350,000 for the period. Depreciation expense was $40,000, gains were $35,000, losses were $25,000, current assets increased by $10,000, and current liabilties increased by $15,000. What is the overall cash provided by or used by operations?

Cash provided by operations = $385,000 ($350,000 + $40,000 − $35,000 + $25,000 − $10,000 + $15,000)

An increase in current assets must be deducted from net income, and an increase in current liabilities must be added. Rule of thumb: If current assets increase, subtract the change from if they decrease, add the change to If current liablities increase, add the change to if they decrease, subtract the change from

In this case, it looks like TBL has a healthy amount of cash being brought in from the operational part of the business; $385,000 is being provided by operations.

The investing activities section of a statement of cash flows shows how a company utilized cash related to investing activities for the period. Another way of thinking of it is that the investing activities section reports what happens because a company “has money and wants to make money.” Let’s think about a couple of examples. A company has money and wants make money Another example occurs when a company invests in fixed assets that help support operations of the business either directly or indirectly. When it buys the fixed asset, it uses cash, and when it sells the asset, it receives cash. It is important to keep in mind here that if the investment security or fixed asset is sold at a gain or a loss, the cash received is reported in the investing section, but the gain or loss is reported as an adjustment in the operating section.

The financing activities section of a statement of cash flows shows how a company raises capital and pays its investors and lenders back. Another way of thinking of this is that the company “needs money and has to get money.” If a company needs cash, it might be able to attain it by borrowing money with a short-term non-working capital or long-term note. It may also obtain additional cash by issuing shares of its own stock. These are all considered financing activities. Thus, whether a company is receiving cash from a short-term loan or using cash by paying back a short-term loan, this is reported in the financing section. Likewise, if a company is issuing stock to receive cash or buying back its own stock utilizing cash, this is reported in the financing section. Because it relates to the issued stock, paying a dividend to stockholders is also reported in the financing section.

Example

TBL Products, Inc. received cash this period in the following amounts: $600,000 from the sale of products for cash, $30,000 from selling a long-term investment security for cash, $25,000 from selling a company truck, $75,000 from taking out a short-term loanfor non-working capital purposes and $100,000 from taking out a long-term loan. How much cash was provided by investing activities and financing activities?

Cash Provided by Investing Activities = $55,000 ($30,000 + $25,000)

Cash Provided by Financing Activites = $175,000 ($75,000 + $100,000)

How the Statement of Cash Flows Relates to Other Key Financial Statements
The statement of cash flows is tied to both the income statement and the balance sheet (Exhibit 0.14.1). As we discussed in this section, the indirect method of reporting the statement of cash flows begins with a reconciliation of net income as reported on the income statement. This net income figure is the accrual-based figure acceptable according to GAAP. The statement of cash flows begins with the GAAP-based net income and reconciles it to cash provided or used by operations.

The statement of cash flows reports the same beginning and ending balance in cash as the balance sheet does. Looking at a balance sheet gives you no idea how a cash balance increased or decreased. Changes in the cash balance are explained in the statement of cash flows. Studying a company’s cash activity is a critical part of the financial analysis of a company, and the statement of cash flows provides information needed for analysis.

Note: The net operating cash flows, the net investing cash flow, and the net financing cash flow are added together to arrive at net cash provided by or used by the company for the period. The resulting change in the ending cash balance is the same for both the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows.

EXHIBIT 0.14.1 The Statement of Cash Flows Linked to Other Financial Statements


Summary
The statement of cash flows is a useful tool in determining how cash is obtained and utilized in a company. A study of a company’s statement of cash flows will tell you not just what the change in cash balance was from one period to the next, but how the cash balance changed. It is important to understand that a company’s operating activities must remain positive in order to sustain the company over long time periods. A company must to provide most of its cash through operations, not through investing activities, or financing activities, which can add debt or ownership equity. If a company is not obtaining proper cash flow from operations, the company’s ability to continue to operate into the future could be of concern. It is important for an informed financial statement user to be aware of this. Overall, all three primary financial statements are very useful to investors. The statement of cash flows is the statement that answers key questions about cash.

0.15 Impact of Accounting on Key Financial Ratios
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Discuss the usefulness of ratios in accounting.
2. Demonstrate the accounting impact on income statement–based, balance sheet–based, and statement of cash flows–based ratios.
3. Summarize the relationship between accounting and finance.
Usefulness of Ratios in Accounting
In this module, you have learned about the accounting cycle usefulness of the financial statements In this final section, you will learn how ratios are tools that utilize accounting data to provide powerful information to decision makers, both internal and external. This is information that the amounts on the face of the financial statements alone cannot provide.

Ratios and ratio analysis can take the two-dimensional information from financial statements and create a three-dimensional view of the company, giving the decision maker significant insigh’t. for use in the decision-making process. Proper understanding of the components of the ratios is key to your overall understanding of ratio analysis. The focus of this section is to explain the impact accounting has on the ratios that you will thoroughly analyze and utilize during your career in finance.

In accounting, users calculate financial ratios periodically in order to provide information used in decision making. Internally, financial ratios are utilized to help managers control production expenses, monitor the timely collection of receivables, and assist in determining the most profitable mix of products to offer customers. Ratios also provide managers with valuable inputs to make key financial decisions such as an investment in a new machine or manufacturing process. Externally, financial ratios are utilized by users to help make key financial decisions such as whether or not to invest in a company, whether to grant a company a loan, and whether to engage a company as a key vendor in a supply chain.

In an audit of financial statements, ratios are used during the planning, testing, and completion phases. They are used to do things like direct attention to areas that need to be focused on during the audit. They are used to find relationships between account balances that prove or disprove the reasonableness of the balances. They are also used to show areas that might have needed more attention and were overlooked throughout the course of the audit.

Ratios are heavily utilized in accounting and finance. In this final module, we will focus on some key ratios from each of the financial statements and how a solid understanding of the accounting components of the ratios can help your overall understanding of the ratios you will use regularly throughout your career.

Did You Know: Most of the time when we think of ratio analysis we think of ratios with common formulas that have easily recognized numerators and demoninators. Sometimes, however, you can simply take the beginning and ending balance of an account and look at the percentage change from one period to the next. By comparing this to changes in past years and to changes that are presently occurring within an industry, you can learn a lot about a company’s financial situation.

Example

TBL Product Inc. had an inventory balance of $450,000 as of 12/31/2020. As of 12/31/2021, the company had an inventory balance of $350,000. Clearly, the inventory balance declined by $100,000. Upon further analysis, however, you can see that it actually went down by 22% [($450,000–$350,000)/$450,000]. Both the $100,000 and the 22% are useful pieces of information. When you look at TBL’s industry data, and you compare other similar companies, the $100,000 decline may be useful, but the 22% may be a more relevant comparison, as companies within an industry can vary in size. If one company has $25 million in revenue and another has $5 million in revenue, the 22% figure provides a more useful comparison than the $100,000.

Accounting Impact on Balance Sheet–based, Income Statement–based and Statement of Cash Flows–based Ratios
Ratio analysis based on the study of financial statement data can be an extremely powerful decision-making tool. When properly utilized, ratio data can help in making decisions based on both past and present information. The information and knowledge gained about a company can help in making decisions that assist the company now and in the future.

In order for ratio analysis to be useful, it is key that the data utilized in the ratios be correct and understood. In this section, we will explain how a strong understanding of financial statement components can enhance your usage of ratio analysis results. More clearly stated, if you understand the financial statements from which you retrieve your data, you will have a better overall understanding of the ratio information you are working with.

For our balance sheet discussion, we will utilize the current ratio, a liquidity ratio. For our income statement discussion, we will utilize gross margin, which measures profitability. For our statement of cash flows discussion, we will utilize the cash flow solvency ratio, which measures solvency. Finally, we will briefly discuss the DuPont formula, which will tie a few concepts together.

EXHIBIT 0.15.1 Key Accounting and Finance Ratio


Current Ratio
In your finance role, you will utilize the data provided by accountants. The current ratio is a commonly used balance sheet ratio that measures a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations and tells financial statement users if a company can utilize its current assets to satisfy its current payables. As seen in Exhibit 0.15.1, it is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. As a financial analyst, you will utilize this formula often to consider the liquidity of a company. Accountants will be behind the scenes working with company accounting and information systems to make sure that each account balance on the financial statements is fairly and reasonably stated. As with net worth, which you previously learned about, it is very helpful to understand what is meant by current assets and current liabilities when utilizing the current ratio. As you work with these calculations, it is important that you remember that current assets are comprised of asset accounts such as prepaids and short-term investments receivables. If you accidentally include long-term assets such as property, plant, and equipment in your calculations, the ratio you are using to make decisions will be incorrect. You must look at current liabilities the same way. Current liabilities consist of accounts such as accounts payable and short-term notes payable various accrued obligations If you inadvertently included long-term notes payable in the calculation, your final ratio calculation will be incorrect. A solid understanding of the balance sheet is critical to proper usage of the current ratio.

Gross Margin
Gross margin is a commonly used profitability ratio. As seen in reference the exhibit number, it is calculated by taking Sales revenues minus cost of goods sold and dividing the result by Sales revenues. Total sales revenues minus cost of goods sold gives you the amount of profit generated from the sale of products or providing services before considering the other types of expenses and support costs, such as selling and administrative expenses, and interest expenses. The sales revenue used in this calculation is the revenue from sale of the actual product. Revenue such as interest revenue and gains on sale of assets are not part of gross margin. The cost of goods sold is the production cost of the goods sold by the company, including costs such as direct material and direct labor. Costs such as interest expense and loss on sale of assets are not included in the cost of goods sold Gross margin is a ratio commonly used in the financial world by accountants, investors, and analysts alike. Understanding the meaning behind it is crucial. It is important when you are working with gross margin that you understand what part of profitability you are looking at; you are looking at the profit made from the actual “sale of the shoe,” for example. You are not looking at the profit after all costs have been considered. Beyond gross margin, you must consider selling and administrative and other types of expenses and revenues.

Cash Flow Solvency Ratio
The cash flow solvency ratio is a commonly used solvency ratio. It is calculated by dividing total cash flows from operations by total liabilities. It measures the company’s ability to pay its debts with its current cash flow. Relative to its industry, a company hopes to have a high cash flow solvency ratio. This ratio requires that, once again, you understand liabilities as presented on the balance sheet. It also requires that you understand cash used or provided by operations in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. Once you have gained a better understanding of the statement of cash flows, making sense of this ratio will be much easier. We have seen that, in order to be successful in the long run, a company must generate cash from the operations of its business, as opposed to cash provided by investing or financing activities. This ratio shows whether cash provided by performing the company’s actual business function is sufficient, or not to pay off the company’s debts.

DuPont Formula
The DuPont formula helps companies analyze their return on equity (ROE). It helps investors understand how efficiently the money they have invested is being managed by the company. The formula gives companies a more meaningful understanding of their ROE by focusing on three basic parts. As seen in Exhibit 0.15.1, the three parts are profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. The DuPont formula requires that you understand components of both the balance sheet and the income statement. The amount of total assets from the balance sheet are used to calculate return on assets. amounts of total assets and total equity from the balance sheet are used to calculate financial leverage. Net profit and sales amounts from the income statement are used to calculate the net profit margin, and sales revenue is used to calculate the return on assets. When looking at return on equity in it most simple form, net profit divided by equity, both the income statement and the balance sheet must be utilized to determine net profit and equity balances. This formula shows you how components of each financial statement work together to give meaning to ratio analysis.

Each of the formulas discussed above is widely used in both accounting and finance. As you become more knowledgable in your understanding of the basic financial statements, calculating and interpreting the results of these ratios will become easier and more meaningful. Consider the ratios and think about what each of the components represent. You will find it much more meaningful to discuss the current ratio when you feel confident you understand what is meant by current assets and current liabilities. You will be much more comfortable discussing company margins when you have a more solid understanding of what the amounts generated by the calculation represent. With the cash flow solvency ratio and the return on equity ratio, the same is true. Once you understand the meanings behind the components from the financial statements, the calculation results will be more useful in your decision-making process.

Summarize the Relationship between Accounting and Finance
Sections 0.11–0.15 of Chapter 0 were designed to give you a basic, yet solid overview of accounting. Accounting knowledge can prove useful throughout your career in finance. Financial analysts have stronger skillsets if they have a solid understanding of how accounting works. Understanding the big picture of how the accounting cycle and adjusting entries work and understanding in what ways the financial statements are useful is a critical part of an analyst’s career. In finance, much of your time and effort will be spent working with key financial ratios. Understanding the accounting origins of those components can help you better understand the ratios you are working with as a whole. Accountants work hard to provide information to decision makers in many ways. A basic understanding of how an accounting cycle works and how the financial statements can be useful is critical to your long-term success throughout your career in finance.
